0.90 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.60	appearance - solid black on the pour . a healthy lighter mocha head of three fingers strong in a duvel goblet . good hold on the head , a number of lace rings left behind as we go . aroma - about the same pleasant roasted grain aroma as the normal guinness , but with a light vapory alcohol edge . taste - good rich roasty flavor , some good coffee flavors in support , both intensified by some well-leveled abv . notes of licorice on the swallow , and a finish of deep roast . mouthfeel - average weight , maybe a bit more . low carbonation , pretty smooth . drinkability - the best guinness product by far imo . welcome to the states . a nice fall sipper after spending several hours out in the evening chill tonight .

0.60 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.90	highly carbonated large yeast chunks very pale orange off-white head lasts a minute or so smells like a creamsicle with big yeast esters and phenolics tastes smooth and well balanced alcohol makes its presence known finishes with a long lingering spiciness reminds me a bit of heavyweight lunacy except this has the phenolics in more control very creamy texture by the end of the beer it was as much from white labs as it was from bells

0.60 0.90 0.90 1.00 0.90	poured from bottle into pub glass . this is one of my favorites , let me preface this before i continue . besides the color ( pale yellow with a tinge of orange ) , everything else is amazing . great bitter citrus in the nose and taste . i love the taste of this beer , the bite from the alcohol is the only reason why i didnt grade it exceptional . if you call yourself a hop head and havent tried this beer before , then find a different term of endearment . definitely a must try .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.40	presentation : 11.2 fl.oz ( 330ml ) duvelian style white painted brown glass stubby with a themed label that reflects the brews name . an eye-patch wearing pirate with his toothless smile dominates the front label whilst in the background wooden barrels and a buccaneer ship complete the display . a small blue colored neck label has the words superior class , from belgium , east flanders ; all this is finished with an appropriately color coordinated crown cap . the main label has a generic design and the words bire du boucanier which appear on all three bdb variants . only the small text words dark ale below the larger word boucanier and alc . 9 % by vol differentiate this from the other two golden ale and red ale versions . appearance : ruddy dark brown settles with a nice looking tan colored head which struts its longevity for some time . gorgeous lacing once the head rests and lays low with a cloth carpet head . finely dissolved conditioning . nose : basic odors . nothing outstanding here . dark malts , burnt sugars , caramel and molasses , normally these ingredients would be able to muster some decent aromas , but here they are an unorganized mish-mash here . taste : starts with a sickly sticky maltose run which rises into a burnt sugar centre piece and a molasses laden malt finish . just awful . far too unbalanced and disjointed . shocking finish reminded me of bonfire toffee mixed with caramelized sugars . very poor structure . mouthfeel : the sugary high alcohol is raw and unpleasant . like a rough rum mixed with molasses and brown sugar with some cheap vodka mixed in for bad measure . drinkability : a real struggle . i liked the fresh boldness of the 11 % bdb golden ale ( hit ! ) and the thrusting spicy-hop character of the 7 % bdb red ale ( hit ! ) ..but the middle of the road 9 % bdb dark ale ( miss ! ! ! ) is a big let down and fails to complete the mnage- a-trois . after the two earlier bdb versions i expected much more complexity from this one . misses by a mile ! far too sickly and unbalanced , sweet and cloying with a high alcohol rum burn that ultimately detracts . the hard looking pirate on the label may portray a positive image but whats in the bottle does not - maybe queer eye for the straight guy could help out here . this needs more work , a *lot* more work , and i dont recommend this until it gets a make-over .

0.20 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.60	this beer is n't next to the pits , it *is* the pits . in appearance , pitside is a golden-yellow with prominent , overbearing haze . the head is very thin , white , and frothy . the nose is strongly sulfurous , but under that the malt tones are quite weak and hops is not notably present . there 's also a hint of uric acid . the flavor is thin and lifeless . no sweetness , a characterless middle with watery generic malt , and a lingering but noncomplex fuggle finish . the mouthfeel is dry from the prominent alcohol but also noticeably wet . carbonation is faint . overall , blah . there are no defects in the flavor , per se -- i do n't think this was an infected cask , since all of warcop 's beers have this kind of boringness about them . the whole thing would be decent , if unexciting , if it were n't so damned weak . not acceptable .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.60	a- pretty close to opaque brown/black . head is thick and tan , stays frim at one finger . a couple wisps of lacing . s- smell is sweeter than many stouts . there is a milk chocolate , molasses , and a bit of caramel . t- there is a slight roasted note to it , but again , it 's sweeter than many in the stye . initially light caramel . there is a definite molasses like character . in the finish there is a bit more roasted , smoky , coffee like character . m- light-medium body , light medium carbonation . both are too low for this style . o- it 's a tasty beer but it 's a bit too sweet , yet light , for me to think of it as much above average in the styke .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90 0.80	as black as an overcast night in the woods with no light . thick creamy , milky , tan head . the head thins , but does n't go away . very mild odor . a little sweetness in the odor . that 's it . taste is a little sweet with a nice bitter bite at the end . very well rounded and balanced . also roasted and a little coffee like , but no coffee in the smell . feels thick and carbonated . mouthfeel is good but nothing special . beer is drinkable . again good but nothing special . worth a growler pick up and many refills hereafter .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70	presentation : poured from 20 oz bottle into watou chalice . appearance : extremely clear yellow , with almost no head at all . the bubbles ( not foam ) that did form during the pour dissipated in seconds . smell : strong belgian yeast-type aroma , very inviting . taste : very very sweet , with almost no carbonation . you can taste the effect of the coriander . notes : not bad , but the lack of carbonation made me wonder if this bottle was finished refermenting ... i liked the sweet taste and the low cost ( $ 4.99 per 20oz ) , but it will take some arm-twisting for me to buy this again .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	i thought this beer looked excellent . nice craggy , tight head , with tons of lacing . golden colour , nice looking . a bit weak on the nose , scents more of a saison than a maibock . taste was good , nice , clean , and crisp . little aftertaste . i feel this is more of a farmhouse saison , however , than a maibock . if it were , the ranking would be higher , but it is not a beer i would ever turn my nose up at . it is good .

0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	thanks to capra12 for this one . 40 minute old hand bottle . poured into a lost abbey snifter . tea 6 is allegedly older viscosity with coconut tea leaves . a : pours black with a single layer of coarse bubbles that dissipates quickly . lacing is very spotty and spare with no cling . s : nose is heavy coconut and cream , chocolate , booze , cocoa , and caramel . very sweet , enticing , and rich with a sharp alcoholic bite . t : opens sweet soy sauce , vanilla , chocolate , booze , and coconut in the back . caramel adds its own layer towards the middle as this one lingers on the palate . booze is pushed to the back . end is caramel , sweet soy sauce , maple syrup . and vanilla . finish is more of the same with a sweet , syrupy aftertaste . m : medium bodied and lightly carbonated . pretty hot in the mouth but appreciably oily going down . finish is messy and aftertaste lingers a long while . d : a very solid offering from lost abbey . the coconut is a nice addition to the imperial stout and offers a flavor profile that has n't really been done before . well executed . worth a try if you get the chance !

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.60	shared by ejyoung at a tasting , this was poured from a scandalously-labeled 750 into a snifter . really , im shocked the label art got past the feds . according to the bottle , this is uprights regular saison , four , thrown in wine barrels with cherries . cloudy ruby grapefruit in color , with a clumpy head like coagulated yeast . a scummy ring of bubbles remains the entire time and seriously weirds me out . tart nose . lemon peel , green apples , white pepper , light peach , lavender and white grape . i do get light hints of oak , but not much cherry . the flavor is even more sour than the aroma . hints of sweet cherries , white grapes , untoasted oak and lemon peel . dryish finish . its a quality flavor , though not very saison-like at all . medium-light , watery body . very lightly effervescent . refreshingly tart . four play is an interesting beer , if nothing else . the downsides : the brett has completely commandeered whatever saison qualities this thing once had , and i was extremely turned off by the appearance . the upsides : it tastes good , and the label art makes me randy .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	sierra nevada champagne bottle , poured into a duvel glass . pours dark black - thick brown foam , long retention and heavy lacing . thick bubbles . roasted malt smell , dark coffee as well . rich hearty taste , deep pine hop , slow alcohol burn . oily hop taste . heavy bittering . subtle medicinal background . real thick , hearty and chewy . not finished without some effort .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.70	pours a very cloudy orange . thin head . this is the cloudiest ipa i have ever seen . this has offsmells right off the bat . animal urine and feces . very sweet with pine overtones . taste is off the scale as this style should be in the hop department . pine forests , sweet malts , and alcohol and hop bittering . great typy taste . mouth feel is medium , but the bitternes takes it off the scale in the drinkibility department . this is a `` sipper '' ipa . other than the offsmels..this was a good offering .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.60 0.60	poured a pretty golden pumpkin orange in the glass with a half finger white head that melted to merely a white ring of lacing . aromas are soft belguim yeasts , pepper and corriander spices , and oranges . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy while very tingly from the tiny carbonation bubbles throughout . taste is sweet candied pale malts , bread dough , oranges , corriander , and white pepper spices . aftertaste leaves you with sugar and orange peel plus something a little stale ... i think the alcohol and yeast reminents .

0.50 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	appearance : pours a completely translucent golden brown body with a thin soapy bubble head that has very little retention . after the head dissipates it looks much like a pint of tea . not much going for it in terms of aesthetics . smell : faint grains , a bit on the metallic side and has a somewhat earthy aroma to it . taste : the nose had me worried but thankfully it is nothing like what i anticipated . very grainy with a bit of biscuit malt , no metallic notes although it does have a hint of bitterness . mouthfeel : quite carbonated which adds to the crispness of this lager , nothing heavy and goes down leaving no trace behind . drinkability : quaff the night away after a summer day with this lager , abv is standard and although isnt very complex it is well balanced . overall : readily available in stores in these parts and makes for a decent choice for a lager on a budget .

0.20 0.30 0.20 0.20 0.40	michelobe ultra ... .. i heard it taste like water i knew it only had a few less cals than lite i knew it only had a few less carbs than lite i knew it was n't going to be worth 8.99 but ... ... ... i was sold . i sold out . yes they sucked me in . those hot bodies on the commercials along with new years resolutions and the next thing you know i 'm walking out of krogers with a 12 pack . it does not taste like water . it tastes like perie . sparkling water ! it does n't really even taste at all like beer . not even a hint . what was i thinking ? ? ? ? ? ? i had to try it did n't i ? ? ? is something wrong with me ? ? ? am i normal ? ? ? somebody help me !

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	i love those belgians but am a little confused with this one . first of all this is an amazing looking beer . a nice pale orange , hazy , with a huge rocky white head . great retention and that belgian lace that i love . smell i didnt much care for . although there was some yeast , sweet fruits , and bit of bread i thought the alochol was overpowering , this i didnt not expect . when it was first a little cooler , and as it warmed , i couldnt get away from the alcohol . i expected it to be present , but i thought it dominated . the taste was pleasant . very good tripel flavor , some fruits and spices , that sweet candi sugar , a bit of grassy hops and that bite of alcohol at the end . mouthfeel was a little fuller than i expected but still pleasant and overall it was a good , drinkable beer .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	this brew pours a small head of dark brown colored bubbles and an opaque black brown colored body . it had a mild malt aroma . it was very smooth and had a mild coffee flavor . i enjoyed drinking this one as it was a very well balanced and a very smooth brew .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	bottled in may of 2009 , oversized wine glass i know this one changes quite substantially over time given the brett . i have also heard six months to a year is a sweet spot for orval , and my review is in reflection of that time frame . a : hazy , lighter side of an amber color . large , fluffy/foamy head . i can already detect alot of carbonation - swish this around and the little bubbles just stick to the sides of the glass before slowly falling back down into the liquid . ok , this is nice to look at , how does it smell ? s : the first thing im looking for is the brett funk , its there , but does n't overwhelm . it blends nicely with spice , grass , and light fruity esters . alot to find if you take your time , i think i was smelling this more than i was sipping it . the aroma is pleasing , but subtle . t/m : cloves and a little coriander ( i usually hate coriander ! ) , light oranges and lemons , some malt comes through though absent from the nose . wheres the funk ? its there but i had to search for it . i actually wanted this to be a little more sour or tart . finish was super dry leaving me with little to savor . to me , orval 's flavor is a bit subdued . i will attribute that somewhat to the copious amount of champagne like carbonation found in this brew , its a bit distracting . on the other hand , orval is quite elegant in its subtleness . its easy to drink ; i tasted this from chilled to room temperature and it never got boozy or cloying like some of the other trappists . this is a positive review of orval from someone who really isnt a huge fan of trappists to begin with . orval is understated and refined . certainly not something i want all the time , but enjoyable none the less .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60	got this at de bierkoning in amsterdam . from a bottle into a mug . appearance : pours a very small and thin off-white head that quickly disappears . lower level carbonation evident , which quickly ceases as well . colour is more brown than red , like a sienna with some faint hints of rust on the sides . zero film stays and no lacing . relatively lack luster , even for the style . smell : a medium strong nose of sweet caramel malt , a bit of toffee and maybe some red fruit in the back . a little one dimensional , but nice enough . taste : sweet caramel malt in the front with some toffee as well , and finishes with a burst of spicy alcohol at the end . aftertaste is nice , mild and long lasting , consisting of some spicy alcohol and a slight touch of bitterness . not bad ; more impressive than the nose . palate : medium body and medium carbonation . relatively creamy on the palate , goes down quite smooth with a small alcohol bite at the very end . finishes on the stickier side of the spectrum . overall : not bad , but not memorable . the look was certainly disappointing , but it was pretty average other than that . drinkable enough , but not worth seeking out .

0.50 0.60 0.60 0.90 0.70	a : the beer is a cloudy amber color . when poured , a head about a finger tall forms but almost immediately disipates . s : a strong citrus lemon scent holds a hint of blueberry smell with it . t : as the other reviews have noted , this beer tastes uncannily like fruity pebbles . in fact it tastes of almost nothing else , with just a hint of grain flavor and a very tiny hops taste near the finish . this is not to say it 's bad tasting ; actually it tastes quite good , but certainly is a bit of a shock when the label clearly says it 's supposed to be beer . m : it feels slick in the mouth - not quite slimey or anything , but somewhat more slick than other beers . the carbonation is very mild here as well . its mouthfeel is in no way entertaining or interesting , but that 's not really a bad thing ; it 's just average . d : drinkability is high as one would expect from what seems marketed as a summer beer . it 's pretty easy to put down a bottle and want more , but this is not because it actually tastes like beer . again , it tastes extremely similar to fruity pebbles . if you like the cereal , i see no reason you would n't enjoy the taste of this beer . do not expect to actually get any beer flavor from this product , but as a beverage it tastes good and drinks well .

0.40 0.60 0.70 0.50 0.50	review from beeradvocate magazine april 2007 . american craft brewer goes african . very original to say the least . mbege is an african alcoholic beverage that 's brewed using finger millet and ripe bananas . sprecher 's version uses real bananas . orange hazed brew is nearly cloudy . fizzy at pour and fizzy from the head , which drops down to a minimal ring around the glass . smells of banana taffy , cooked cereal grain and bubble gum . crisp and slick all over , with a medium body . banana bubble gum flavor throughout becomes tiring after a while . cinnamon and nutmeg ? coarse grain and a mild astringency in the middle . mineral , raw sugar cane and kosher salt come to mind , present but very faint . spark of clove flavor towards the finish . finishes semi-dry with a banana taffy and bubble gum flavor . interesting is probably the best way to describe this beer ; others will love it or hate it . share it with a few friends -- 16 ounces are a chore to finish , but at least it 's a good conversation piece . regardless , you have to hand it to sprecher for their creativity and passion .

0.30 0.50 0.60 0.50 0.20	poured from a 12 ounce clear glass bottle into a duvel tulip . small fizzy white head vanished as quickly as it appeared . the pale green chili floating in the glass really ruins the appearance . unsurprisingly the smell is a combination of a pale lager and peppers . not only does it taste like chili peppers but it 's also a little spicy which for some reason i was not expecting . i enjoyed the novelty of this beer but overall it was just a little too wierd and gross for me and the last bit of beer was poured down the drain .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	smell : fresh acidic strong american ( cascade ? ) hops . 1st pine then citrus . sweet malt takes a backseat . taste : tastes like a good american ipa . the wet hops do add a noticable bitter bite and astrigency to the beer . app : deep amber clear . very thick fluffy white head w/lace . mouth : medium drinkability : pretty good if you like bitterness .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	22 oz bottle into a snifter glass . pours what appears to be a dark as dark can be black that built up a finger and a half head . head is tannish with hints of ruby in the lacing . the lace stays with the beer all the way down , and it is sticky as hell . it was n't until the end of my glass , as i was looking down at it , could i see a honey yellow tint that surrounded the lace as it stared back at me . a absolutely beautiful looking beer . i do n't listen to alot of jazz , but i watched a live performance of bitches brew before i drank this , and i see why sam and the crew from dfh made this into a jazzy beer . there was flavors from everywhere , and i coul n't get a constant pattern to things . at first , the beginning was really sweet , and finished with a roasty vanilla chocolaty malt feel , but about halfway through , the flavors changed up on my , and i was hit with the roast first and finished with the sweetness . i could detect the honey , chocolate , expresso , vanillia , caramel and some serious hop bitterness in the finish . overall , a really great beer , and i am even more excited to revisit with some age attached .

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90	what a hilarious bottle ! so many little comments and insight , i really dig it . i poured this substitute holiday ale into a shaker pint . appearance- there was barely any foam on the hard pour . it mustered one finger width of bubbly cap , but it dissolved quickly to a slight ring with foamy bits scattered on the lid . the body is a transparent gold with some neat auburn hightlights where the light hits it . smell- wow , absolutely fantastic , hoppy nose.there is so much grapefruit and a candy sweetness that is more reminiscent of pineapple . and it is strong . resiny-pine intimations are also present behind that great citrus pop . taste- the taste is not nearly as sweet , but i think that may be because the bitterness really kicks your mouth around . it does not give you the common courtesy of doing something like sorting out the sweetness on the palate . after the bitterness has had its moment , grapefruit becomes very prominent . there is not so much pineapple , being replaced by more of the resiny hop oil flavor . there is only a slight biscuit malt impression near the end , and that is really appreciated . this ipa can stand on it 's own with the flavor hops , and letting the beer get too malty could have really affected the taste score . mouth feel- this is fine medium body and the creaminess is decent . it is not distracting , but it is also not knock - your - socks off good . overall- this is a very enjoyable ipa with a world class nose , no doubt about it . the flavors pull back ever so slightly on the palate , but they are still fantastic . yes , it is definitely worthy of the praise it has been receiving , and i would gladly have this again .

0.20 0.60 0.30 0.20 0.40	1997 vintage , poured into a mikkeller long stemmed goblet . a : the instant the cap is pulled from the bottle , it is clear that this is going to be a disaster . the cork in question has a serious amount of black sludge coating it . this sight alone says to me `` bad idea dude , turn away '' . the pour starts out normal , but eventually leads to large chunks of sediment falling from the open container ( another bad sign ) . there is no carbonation and absolutely no head . the beer is black as pitch . s : the smell is incredibly overwhelming . i 'm picking up raisins , figs , cherries , maple , some smoky notes , and some definite alcohol . t : this beer tastes like burnt raisin soy sauce sludge . it 's insane . i said to myself before i opened the bottle that i would refuse to drainpour this beer , but i literally just dry heaved and almost vomited in my mouth . sip number two and i 'm more under control , but it 's still terrible . picking up flavors of tree bark , dirt , rotten fruit , and some serious sour . i do n't know how much of this one man can physically take . m : please do n't make me take another sip ... it 's thick like a cough syrup and it leaves it 's brutal flavors on the palate long after it 's gone . d/o : no thanks . never again .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	pours pale yellow with almost no head . smell is sweet with corn and maltiness in the taste . very carbonated , and light , obviously , easy to drink , and tastes decent enough . nothing spectacular , but i do n't get all the really low ratings . this was n't supposed to be a big bold beer that turned out light . rating it for what it is , this is good for the style .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90 0.80	i had this on tap at taco mac mall of georgia in a 20 oz mug . first off , i 've read a lot of the reviews on this beer and i disagree with most . i think this is exactly what an imperial porter should taste like . i do taste the alcohol , but i expect it in an imperial style beer . ok , let 's get down to specifics a- just what i want to see from a beer not on nitro , a nice foamy head that fades into compact bubbles that leave lacing all down the glass as you drink . s - probably my only gripe about the beer for me - no discernible smell of anything . t - i taste alcohol almost right away , but in this case that 's ok . it 's smooth and warming , not in your face . otherwise you get the melding of background flavors . you expect hints of chocolate , but its really not there . yet i still like this beer . maybe i like it for as much as what is there as what is n't . d - i think i could drink quite a few of these , but i would be sorry .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.70	12 oz . bottle from the recent 2008 unplugged series release . pours a clear , medium copper , very much like apple juice . small , fizzy , short-lived , off-white head . strong aromas of apples on the nose . very fresh , with apple sweetness and crisp tartness ( like an excellent honeycrisp in the fall ) . some caramel and cookie dough notes mix in seamlessly . caramel apple pie anyone ? light apple tartness up front . ample apple sweetness follows and dominates the palate . the sweetness seems very apple-y though , and not artificial . apple skin tartness picks up near the finish , along with caramel and pie crust . finish is full of lingering apple sweetness mixed with apple peel bitterness . medium bodied with a sparkly feel . a very interesting beer , that somehow avoids tasting too cider-y and keeps its beer character . worth trying , even if you 're not a fruit beer fan .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.40	22 oz bomber app- golden peach colored with a quickly dissipating white head . sm- peaches with a decent medicinal component . cautiously optimistic . ta- peach flavored robitussin . that 's it . its so strong you ca n't taste malt , hops anything . if i were to finish this i would never eat peaches again . horrible . mf- syrupy . ov- this is bad . like really bad . it makes you wonder why they even released this . i 'm sure it was n't a cheap beer to make but someone should have stepped up and nixed this . maybe since it was a collaboration there were too many toes to step on ...

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90 0.90	750 ml bottle , # 07157 of 11960 , poured in to a 22 oz . brandy snifter . appearance : a thick , luxuriant , opulent tan head , eruptive and violent at the outset but quickly placated in to a finger-and-a-half of pillowy , rocky goodness . the foamy , cocoa cloud sits atop the viscous , inky black body that lets nary a wisp of light show through . carbonation is present and actually relatively quick for the style and abv % , but its sparseness belies its origin . the lacing is similarly nice , impressive for both a beer of this magnitude and particularly one that 's barrel aged , strewing soapy , spongy strings all over sides of the snifter . it actually somewhat resembles chocolate milk that 's been recently stirred and is still frothy and foamy . in fact , the retention and lacing are so remarkable i 'm going to bump this one up to a 5.0 - the stick is just truly you do n't see in a beer of this type . aroma : even with severe agitation , this one does n't approach near the level of openness or complexity as the flavor . slightly steely , bittersweet cocoa , cinnamon , toast , spicy hops , and anise are practically all i get , coupled with a slightly spicy , tingly , warming alcohol sensation . not as pleasant as the flavor profile . taste : hmm , where to begin . waves of bittersweet chocolate are the most obvious note here . i say bittersweet with no regard to what the word might actually mean , but instead to simply imply that the chocolate notes - surely , the result of heavily toasted malts and not the addition of any actual chocolate - are moderately well-attenuated , such that both the slightly bitter , earthy astringencies as well as the sweeter , roastier aspects both shine through . toast , slight caramel , dark toffee , a definite wholesome oak kick , and earth are all malty words i 'd use to describe the malt foundation of this one . what makes it interesting , though , are the other notes . for instance , this one does have a remarkably pungent and powerful hop presence , noticeable both in the bitterness as well as in the after-feel , i.e. , that noticeable hop note you get in the burp . it 's a different kind of burn than the one associated with the minor amount of alcohol that comes through in this one . barrel aging adds a slight woody presence that 's augmented well by the earthy maltiness and a slight vanillin presence . a moderate fruitiness and spiciness - cinnamon , light sweet cherries , raisins - and faint smoke or perhaps barrel char round out the flavor profile . a complex ris , but the keyword here is truly balance . mouthfeel : not as creamy as one would expect or hope if the flavor profile were sweeter , more chocolatey , more roasty , and not as fluffy as one would expect if it were ... well , anything other than those above descriptors . it strikes a fairly good balance between the two , which is precisely the sort of balance you want with the balance described above , that is , the balance achieved by the flavor profile . drinkability : `` well-crafted '' would be the phrase that best describes this beer . initial thoughts that struck me as i began the experience is that it struck a very fine balance between all the components - not too fruity , not too spicy , not too dry , not too sweet , not too much of anything really . it 's balanced , complex , and just terribly , terribly drinkable . i 'm very glad to have tried this one , and it continues boulevard 's incredible record with the smokestack once-offs . as i think i just mentioned in a forum , i tried the saison-brett a few months back , just had the bbq two nights ago , and capped off the incredible run with this gem . all in all , a stellar beer , one i 'm thrilled to have tried , and one i hope boulevard reproduces in some capacity at some point . cheers .

0.60 0.90 0.80 1.00 1.00	big thanks to kkipple for hooking me up with a hand bottle of this gem . i was glad to have the opportunity to take it home and share with some fellow beer geeks . a-deep , dark black -- almost looks like thin motor oil . unfortunately , time in a bottle was not kind to the carbonation level and there was no head of any kind . quite disappointing after seeing what the draft version looked like . s-lots of vanilla , dark chocolate , and bourbon sweetness . bits of dark fruit , cherry and some tobacco . even notes of toasted coconut which i did not get before . this is such a complex brew . t-despite the lack of carbonation with one still tastes great ! rich and robust with the cornucopia of flavours on the palate that are in the nose . so much going on it 's like having a rave party in your mouth ! m-heavy bodied , viscous thick and oily . the lack of carbonation hurts here a bit as the creamy texture is lost . still good but not the same as the fresh draft . d-regardless of the carbonation loss this one still tastes great and is a real head scratcher when you try to figure out all of the flavours . i was glad to share this awesome beer with some good friends .

0.80 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.40	pours deep orange , with a small off-white head . very active carbonation in this filtered beer ... nose is of mildly sweet detergent , reminds me particularly of automatic dishwasher detergent . a bit soapy . taste is better than the nose , a bit citrus-like , though further into the taste more detergent-like bitterness appears and becomes the dominant feature . beer goes down the drain shortly thereafter . another poor beer from huyghe brewery , whose only claim to fame seems to be the delerium beers despite having a stable of utterly mediocre products .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.60	surprise surpise ! a na beer with almost ... almost an actual beer taste . hell , it 's got more taste than many to most true light beers . sure enough though , it 's na . now , that being said i may never have one again . i drank this because i was at a resort in the bahamas , the water was warm and tasted awful and i already had enough of a buzz going . also , it was free to me . under the circumstances , this is just fine . elsewise ? do n't pay good money for it .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	quite excited to try this one - poured into a duvel tulip a thick black with very little chocolate milk-like head that quickly falls back to the rim as a bubbly ring . nose is lightly burnt chocolate and roasted coffee with a touch of alcohol . big and sweet chocolate up front , slick feel , and dry roasted malts and light tobacco through the finish . mostly smooth with very light carbonation - the alcohol makes its presence known with lingering heat . this is pretty intense sweetness , it 's going to be a long sipper . glad i got two , but this is n't my favorite from gi - i think i liked the hoppy balance of night stalker more - a bottle of each will sit in solitary confinement for a while before i take them out .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	yesterday i drank the blond of westvleteren and today the 8 stands before me . bought it in cafe in de vrede when i was there the last time i picked up the blond beer . of course poured in my westvleteren chalice . the beer is very darkbrown , like the 12 . the head is lightbrown and very bubbly . a very exeptional view of a very overhyped beer . after a few minutes the head is a few millimeter thick . very balanced taste , not that sweet as the 12 . very drinkable . again i have problems with the smell . there is not much i smell but thats the problem i have with other beers . i drank the 8 last night ( july 30th 2011 ) after i drank a westy 12 . there is a big difference between these beers , always has been . the one i had yesterday had a bit more sourness in it than i could remember .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	i have this one sitting in the cellar for at least a year or two now so it should be pretty mellow and smooth . brown color with tons of yeast floaters . very thin tan head . nothing special to look at but not terribly out of character for the style . smell of cherries and other dark fruits and it even reminds me a little of a red wine . very earthy notes , like a dark rich soil . also a hint of alcohol that is n't a surprise at all given the 11 % abv . taste is very malty , caramel and molasses . very thick and sweet . nice warming feeling from the high abv . a nice beer . it seems to have aged nicely from what i remember having a few years ago , but i also think my palate has matured some too . very smooth with no bite at all in the finish . overall a very nice barley wine . i 'm beginning to enjoy this style more and more . i 'll have to get a fresh one of these soon to compare and see how this one aged . another solid offering from weyerbacher .

0.90 0.40 0.20 0.30 0.20	750ml , 2009 ( ? ) vintage pours pitch black and completely opaque with a one finger frothy beige head that slowly fades into a lasting ring . sporadic rings and spots of lacing are left behind . slightly tart and metallic smelling with hints of sweet boozy bourbon and earthy oak . faint roasted malt underneath but this one is dominated by notes of infection and barrel character . this beer is overly oxidized and pretty badly infected . tight abrasive carbonation up front that lingers throughout into a sour metallic finish . some of the intended flavors are evident ( sweet boozy bourbon , oak and vanilla from the barrel as well as some dark , roasted malt notes ) but the overwhelming vinegary metallic infected notes kill off almost everything pleasant about this beer . only a few sips and then down the drain .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	wine stained leather . incredibly aromatic , milk chocolate , fruits ( grape , currants ) , coriander , lactose and molasses . subtle , funky , light bodied , lingering flavorful with a variety of fruit ( grapes , apricots , raisins ) and spice ( coriander , wood shavings ) . not as tart as i was hoping for . well hidden alcohol , like every fantome beer . im not taking this to the grave with me but i still enjoyed it .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle a - hazy golden brown with a thick off color white head . some sediment and good lacing . s - very sweet malt , almost reminds me of how a belgian quad smells . lots of spice in it , raisins and obviously , brown sugar . t - not a sweet as the you would think , actually some hop bitterness to it . the front is sweet , i get vanilla and caramel . hoppy in the middle and sweet brown shugga on the end ! m - full bodied with medium carbonation . coats the mouth perfectly and leaves it wanting so much more . d - far to drinkable , i will look for it again and should like to have it on tap .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.60	dark brown , almost black in color . huge , foamy beige head that leaves several lace rings smeared down the glass . kinda like the glass is wearing a striped shirt . thick foam retention . smells like dirt , light roast coffee , and brown sugar . tastes primarily of lightly roasted coffee . brown sugar sweetness and mild vanilla . sour nutty twang in back . mouthfeel is of watered down iced coffee . overall an average coffee beer that could be much thicker and much roastier . it seems like a lot more could be done with 6.2 % abv .

0.30 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60	poured a very dark brown with a ruby tint if held up to bright light . no head whatsoever and no lacing or sign of carbonation at all either . it just looked like a glass of flat dark brown cola . not very inviting . smelled of coffee and alcohol , with perhaps some bread as well . the alcohol presence seemed to lessen as the beer warmed . tasted a lot like coffee with liquor mixed in . again , some breadiness but not much else going on . mouthfeel was semi thick , and again with no sign of carbonation . not very exciting . i 'd probably rate this beer lower in drinkability if i were the only one drinking it . as mentioned i do n't like coffee so this beer just was n't my cup of ... er , coffee . for those who do however i guess this might be a beer worth at least a try . i was bit surprised how much i tasted the alcohol , as the abv was pretty low . all in all , i was n't impressed with this beer . i wo n't be revisiting this one .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	clear dark ruby appearance . creamy , somewhat bubbly , beige head sits on top . good staying power . laces adequately . a sweet malty aroma , but not overwhelming . taste is rather inhibited for a scotch ale . there 's some matly tones , but not nearly deep or complex enough to rate this highly . some traces of alcohol land of the palate throughout . a caramel matliness is the domineering characteristic . medium to full in body . not a bad beer by any means , but compared to my `` standard '' for all scotch ales , mcrogue , this one is nowhere near the quality .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	355 ml undated bottle poured into pokal . from seasonal six-pack available at nslc . pours a surprisingly orange body with a fizzy white head that is gone in the blink of an eye . lots of carbonation visible in the clarity . earthy noble hop nose with grainy sweet malt . sweet honey biscuit tasted first with underlying floral and earthy bitterness that comes out more near the finish . medium light body , nicely mild carbonation and a dry clean finish . decent beer , refreshing and flavorful , though there are better options in the style .

0.30 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.40	ah man , this stuff was made to let me know how bad beer can be . as bad a busch or beast , no but they all get the same rating . i 'm not going to go into the smell and taste and all that jazz . we 've all had it and it only gets worse when you open your second . the aftertaste may be the worst experince about this beer . do yourself a favor and skip it .

1.00 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.30	this beer pours ridiculously clear with tons of carbonation that forms a rather impressive rocky head that settles slowly into a fairly dense layer of foam . this is a real good lookin ' beer , unfortunately it gets worse from here ... first , the aroma is kind of bubblegum-like and grainy . next , the taste is sweet and grainy with an unpleasant bitterness in the finish . this fat weasel tastes more like a strong european lager than an ale , with a grainy and bitter fusel alcohol-laden finish . forgot whatever anybody else says about this beer : it is nothing more than a bad malt liquor masquerading as an ale . i 'd sooner drink haffenreffer private stock instead of this crap . overall , the fat weasel is good for a fairly cheap buzz , but only if you like your beer grainy and bitter .

0.80 0.70 0.30 0.50 0.50	i got this 500ml single from manchester wine & liquors in manchester ct for $ 2.79 . served cold in a chilled pint glass . murky yellow brew with a slight orange tint gives a healthy 2 '' of eggshell head that crackles loudly like rice krispies as it settles . smell has a light caramel sweetness , vanilla and some raw grain , but otherwise smells pretty light and thin like an epl . taste leads with a sticky kind of light caramel which is quickly followed by a fairly strong muddy unappealing hop . feel has a sugary slickness and viscosity , otherwise thin and watery , sharp carbonation , and a bit of alcohol burn . diacetyl is apparent throughout and lingers into the finish . i 'm not impressed at all , it is a stretch to call this even mediocre . the feel is utterly terrible , like fizzy watered down corn syrup , and the hop is just gross .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.70	this flying dog offering pours a extremely clear amber , not ipa like at all . a mediocre head bubbles quickly away . very little lacing . smell has floral hops with balanced malt hues countering . honey sweetness . not nearly enough definitive hops , the malt almost overwhelms the hop . bready . i found the mouthfeel to be thick , and not nearly astringent enough . despite its flaws it is a tasty brew , more of a pale ale , it 's still drinkable .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	the beast grand cru ale , 2008 vintage , batch 6 , 16.31 % abv serving 12 oz bottle to palm tulip glass a - murky brown amber with very thin head around the glass , continuing to effervese but could be because it 's cold . maybe next time i try this one room temp . s - sweet molasses and raisin/dates . alcohol scent is powerful t - chocolate and raisins with dark molasses/brown shuga . similar to a spiced black dominican rum . m - thick like syrup or a liquor . a very chewey beer , luckily the light carbonation keep it more drinkable . o - i was very excited about this one because it was a bday treat to myself . i found a distributor that has a whole vintage and rarity shelf . it 's incredibly bitter sweet like dark chocolate while having a strong rum flavor almost like drinking a glass of gosling 's while eating a chocolate bunny ... not a bad idea either . next time i try this one it 'll be room temp . over all it 's an excellent sipper and enjoyer . even now at the end of the review i 've still got half the glass left . ca n't wait to try the rest of the demon avery series

0.60 0.70 1.00 1.00 0.90	hair of the dog adam 12oz bottle from batch 82 poured into a tulip served roughly 50 degrees . a : poured a murky dark brown with a few floaties towards the end . lively light brown head with great lacing . s : not an overpowering nose but subtle and pleasant . a little bit of raisony dark fruit with hints of chocolate and molasses . i noticed another review mention flintstone vitamins and low and behold it was there . t : absolutely amazing . it had been a while since i have had an adam and i forgot how great it is . similar to the nose there is a bit of raison , molasses , tobacco , alcohol and even though this is not the wood version there is still a hint of a wood like flavor . so many flavors and none of them are overpowering . m : beautifully creamy mouth feel . it has a very unique feel to it due to the fact that it is full and creamy but without the thick oily viciousness you would expect from such a large beer . o : this is a fantastic beer . the taste is 5 out of 5 all the way . there are so many flavors that pop up throughout and they are all balanced and delicious . i am lucky enough to drink a lot of amazing beers living in southern california but adam is in my top ten for the year .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	this batch is listed at 8.29 % abv . i 'm dosing off more than usual tonight while watching the game , coca-cola is n't doing the trick , and i want a tasty beverage that ( hopefully ) wo n't let me down . hello lagunitas cappuccino stout ! on to the beer : looks deep ruby brown with hues of red , lighter color than i was expecting . it 's not even close to black . head retention is solid on top . smells like ... bitter coffee with a kick of vanilla . it 's okay , i guess . most beers balance the beer and the coffee , but this tends to be more coffee dominant . bitter coffee greets the palate at first . and that how it remains for the most part . there is an underlying kick of roasted chocolate underneath the coffee , with a medium body and some fizz . not much else going on here . well , that was less exciting than expected . it looks like an irish red , and taste like coffee . not a bad beer per se , but a dissapointment in the field of double stouts .

0.80 0.30 0.20 0.20 0.20	what can i say about this one ? i have had the previous years ofest here and while they are not great they are not this ! i have drank many a octoberfest in my day and this one was by far the worst of the bunch . here is my review . a-the only thing that was going for it . nice clear reddish orange , with a nice clean foam that hung in there . it looked great , boy was i in for a suprise . now it all goes down hill . s- umm smell , hello smell , where are you ? this smelled like they mixed my beer with something , umm cleaner perhaps . t- well ok for the first split second everything was fine..then blech , it tasted awful ! it had no malt taste , no hop taste , just bitter solvent hell ! i wanted to spit it out . the aftertaste left you with that look like you were expecting good and got nasty ( afterall it looked great ) , that cringe scared look . i even asked for another in a clean glass thinking it was tainted with something like detergent and unfotunately this was the same nasty stuff . m- yuck d- never again . i have to say that court ave has got some issues . i come here about once a week after work and sometimes they get batches that are great other times awful . this o-fest was awful , like so many of there other offerings . they recently had there brewmaster doing a course on how to brew ... being a lowly homebrewer with very little experience myself i have never had a beer taste as horrible as this stuff . they really really need to get opinions on there beers before throwing them out to the general public .

0.40 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.90	thanks to shadesofgray for this one . 3oz pour from a corked and caged unlabeled 750ml bottle into a tjs snifter . bottle was signed enjoy the magic yellow bus ride tomme arthur . had at a tasting on 9/4/11 . thin white lace . cloudy deep white peach puree color . patchy lace with no retention . not much of a looker . sour and sweet peach puree . tickly yeast funk . huge fruit aroma . simple but very big and bold . opens sour peach flavor . some pulpy sweetness . some brett characteristics . cobweb . lemon . more peach in middle . oaky towards middle . cheese funkiness . end tart peach slightly dry . sharp . aftertaste is tart . medium bodied . low to moderate carbonation . smooth and oily in the mouth . goes down warm , slick . finish messy with lingering aftertaste . not really to style ( not lively ) but very nice . lambic-like . im very privileged to have the opportunity to have this beer . its very different from other american wilds . very robust , deep , and not only funky , but cheesy . that being said , having this side by side with the veritas 004 , the 004 is a touch better . still , its one phenomenal peach sour .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	thanks ( i think ? ) to a great town of esopus recycler , who shall remain nameless , for tipping brian and i of a case of these 16 oz . cans . a sickly , pale , light straw , topped by a half hearted off white head , which fades quickly , and , with its absence , leaves the pilsner glass appearing to hold the carbonated urine specimen of a terminally ill diabetic . smell is an almost non existent aroma of corn and sugar , as lacking in bouquet as the gobi desert is lacking in rainforest . what smell there is reminds me of bus station bathrooms . the taste of this is an undersexed , deformed , stunted , alien facsimile of what real beer tastes like . i 'd like to describe the malt bill , but there is n't one , or the hop profile , but i think they did n't use hops in this recipe . i mean it , none . i get a very light artificial tasting graininess , and a sort of watery , fizzy thing going on , like someone tried to make beer-flavored soda and only put a quarter of the proper amount of artificial ingredients into the mix . what is the use of justifying a score for mouthfeel for a beer better suited to use as slug trap than for enjoyment . drinkability is ... well i just poured the rest of this vile substance down the drain . this is the first time i have gotten something for free and ended up feeling i overpaid .

1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80	whoa is right with this one . this is a `` big '' brew in my opinion , hence its name . pours a thick creamy head and has a dark brown color with hints of amber . the taste ha , thick hops in here . think of biting into a big juicy fruit . terrapin comes out strong with this seasonal . taste of alcohol is well hidden , but will creap up on you in a hurry . i have found this most of the year for some reason . i guess they distributed alot of it in the atlanta area .

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.20	fucking chili pepper in the bottle ! copper-tinged , yellow body with a very ephemeral , spittly-white head . lasted maybe a second . oh , and there 's a big , puke-green chili pepper floating around in my pint glass . smells of sweetish , caramally-cereal malts that try to break through a fresh-groud coffee/pepper spiciness . weird . tastes like hot , liquid tacos . blecch . salty , and soapy sweet malts are briefly identifiable , before hot , peppery spices take over for good ( or bad ) . finish is burning and not good . gets half a point for creativity . will i drink this again ? not sober . did i even finish the bottle ? hell no .

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.50	$ 1.49 / bottle jr liquor stevens point , wisconsin appearance - let me just start out by saying , `` huh ? '' there are little floaty thingys in this beer . i do n't know what to make that . at first glance the herbal ale looks to be an amber hue with an suble oragne glow . topped with a 1/4 inch of white head that lasts for a minute or two . then , the floaty thingys . smell - the hops are eveident in the scent but there is something uncommon there as well . taste - the hoppiness covers up any real distinctiveness this madtown brewer may have had . however , there 's an aftertaste not common to any brew i frequent . the sharpness in the the flavor is rather impressive . take a few more slow sips and you 'll come accross very different flavors from start to finish . mouthfeel - smooth , but considering the difference in flavors throughout each gulp the location of the impact on the tongue remains the same . maybe that 's an impressive feat . i 'll go with that . ~ i 'm sorry but the floaty thingys really turn me away from the brew . if not for that i 'd likely purchase this beer again . most likley , this was a one night stand .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.40	12 oz . bottle poured into a tulip glass . appearance-pale to medium gold , with a slight cast of haze , and a moderate white frothy head with decent retention . aroma-light grainy malts blend with moderately low notes of hops , but are overtaken by notes of butter ( diacetyl ) and corn ( dms ) . light fruity esters present as well.there are some redeeming notes , but on the whole , the buttered corn aroma really is n't doing it for me . flavor-better than the aroma but still not great . up front the buttery diacetyl rears its ugly head again , but its blunted a bit by a sort of mineral quality and some moderately low hop flavor/bitterness . however , in the finish , the corny dms comes out and the buttery flavor returns . mouthfeel-medium body with moderate carbonation . some slickness is contributed by the diacetyl . simply put , this beer was not good . pilsners are supposed to be clean and free of ester and other yeast characters , showcasing malt and hop flavors . unfortunately , this one was a bit messy , and not one i 'll be drinking again .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.70 0.80	pours the nearly clear yellow color of miller light with wide pure white head . smell is something like grain and dry cardboard , there is a little twinge of hops there . very weird taste , kind of bland with some hops and some grain . it is crisp but not quite refreshing . not much of a finish , but it is drinkable .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a slightly hazy pale golden copper . dense two finger head shows good retention but weak lacing . the nose is mild , but diverse . pale , pilsener and crystal malt aromas jump out first-along with some dextrins . a fruity ester character and subtle american hops are just percievable in the background . the taste is sweet as it passes the lips , caramel and toasted pale malt . a sharp pilsener tone plays against the sweetness , as does a moderate american hop bitterness . the aftertaste is semi-dry , with a vaguely herbal and citric hop flavor emerging , and a curious banana/strawberry ester . medium bodied on the lightrer side of carbonation- which allows the light but complex blend of flavors to bloom . finishes with a touch of toasty caramel and drying low-cohumulone hop bitterness to match . the overall flavor is balanced and interesting but not overwhelming- a fine session ale .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	had this at bar volo for $ 35 a bottle new years day 2011 . even an aggressive pour ca n't coax any carbonation out of this rarish brew . quite a lot of delicious sediment containing most of the flavour at the bottom makes this an uneven pour , and much more enjoyable after it warms up a bit and you get about half way through the bottle . would recommend putting this on its side and rolling it a bit before serving . visually it is very dark , almost a dark coal colour with only a few rays of light barely making its way through the glass . no discernible legs on the oversized wine glass i drank it from but it does leave a thin coating on the inside of the glass . it smells a lot boozier than it tastes . hard to describe the taste actually , as it warmed up i started getting a better appreciation for its subtle flavours . it was much smoother to drink than i expected . i got a bit of smoke and dark chocolate and the rest blended in too neatly for me to identify individual flavours . overall very enjoyable .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	22 oz . bottle appearance : this beer had a deep ebony appearance as it sat in the glass . there were some dark caramel hints around the edges if it was held up to the light . the tan head rose up quickly to three fingers , even with an easy pour . it was course , though , and disappeared quickly , leaving a rough layer of bubbles lingering on top of the brew . the lacing was patchy at best . smell : the bourbon definitely came through on the nose . it dominated at times , but was not overpowering . it intermingled with other aromas of cocoa , coffee , vanilla , and roasted malt . mouthfeel : rather thin-bodied and watery . it was also over-carbonated , which did n't help the mouthfeel any . taste : initially , the flavor was sweet chocolate , vanilla , cream and a light touch of roasted malt . then on the finish came the bourbon flavor . it lingered into the aftertaste where it was joined by a stronger , roasted flavor . occasionally , the bourbon overpowered the other flavors and i found this rather distracting . but there were other sips where everything balanced out well . i had been looking forward to trying this beer for months , but it did n't quite live up to what i was expecting . while still an enjoyable brew , it was thin in both consistency and flavor . plus , 22 ounces of over-carbonated beer made me feel bloated as hell . not bad , but not worth the $ 7.99 ( $ 6.79 with discount ) that i paid for it .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.20	poured into a tulip glass , it developed four fingers of foamy tan head on top of a dark brownish red body . head starts to collapse relatively soon , but leaves some sticky lacing . smell has a certain candy sweetness to it , like a grape flavoured hard candy . the smell is not especially strong and does n't have a lot of depth to it , but it does n't smell bad . oh my goodness , the taste is certainly not what i expected . i think this is the worst beer taste i 've had . there is a harsh , medicinal , artificially sweetened cinnamon on sour grapes taste . the description does n't exactly match the real thing , but that is the best i could do . mouthfeels is thin but sticky with average carbonation . by this point i do n't want to have anymore , i 'm just finishing the review . awful , should n't even be called beer .

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.30 0.40	appearance : as with its organic ale sibling , the pour is impressive , with the golden liquid capped by a fluffy white head ; the retention is just average , however , and not much lacing is left behind smell : awful euro lager tones , verging on skunky , despite the brown bottle taste : tastes like a euro lager , with a strong , sulfuric , twangy character that comes on particulary strong in the finish mouthfeel : light body with moderate carbonation overall : not a particularly good example of the style , unfortunately

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.90	tried this beer for the first time . this is a very good beer . i poured it into a glass and it had a small white head that disappered quick . it poured a very light golden color . while the beer was sitting on the table i looked down at it , the bottom of the glass was almost clear as water . took the first sip and it was very mild , almost creamy . i could also feel the carbonation on my tounge . it was n't intense . it was actually quite a nice feel . this is definatly a beer worth trying .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.60	lot 338 . exploder ! lost about 2/3 of this beer down the drain as foam . whats left is a cloudy medium brown color with floaties . plenty of head ( obviously ) which dissipates quickly . aroma is tons of malt and dark fruit . the flavor is again very fruity with bready malt and caramel notes . a bit of roast malt . no hint of spices anywhere . full bodied with plenty of silky crispness .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.50	served on-draught into a 25cl fassla glass in bamberg . reviewed from notes . expectations were pretty moderate ; i tend to prefer czech pilsners to german pilseners . a : pours a two finger head of no cream , decent thickness , and below average retention . colour is a clear yellow . sm : slight cream and plain clean barley . a very light strength aroma . t : clean barley as a foundation . a hoppy climax . some underlying cream . very simple but also quite refreshing . balanced to an extent . mf : smooth with nice coarseness on the climax . wet . refreshing . dr : average abv . it slides down easily enough , but it 's far from special .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.80	pours a deep brown color with a thick , brown head into my glass . great presentation here . aroma is full of sweet malt with notes of caramel and raisin in the nose . at least , this is what i pick out . there 's just a hint of hops . taste is full of subtle , sweet malt with just a hint of bitterness to it . not much else in the way of flavor . mouthfeel is full of crispness , probably from the carbonation level . lingering molasses-like taste and slight burn from alcohol . check it off as drinkable but otherwise , it seems unremarkable . the name is fun to say though . solid at the most .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.80	served from a flint bottle into a boston lager glass . poured at refrigerator temp , left to stand to warm to proper serving temp and to hopefully dissipate the skunky aroma . this beer , like its corporate brethren such as old speckled hen is bottled in flint ( that is , clear ) glass bottles . properly handled ( that is , left in the lightproof cardboard box until serving ) this is n't a problem . but these beers get put on an open shelf in a beer store where they suffer long exposure to daylight and fluorescent light , causing them to be skunked . clearly this is n't intended by the brewer and detracts from enjoyment somewhat . now , let 's see if this beer is yet warmed up enough to share with us its sweet , malty treasures . the ( earlier ) pour was beautiful : a fine dark amber ale , crystal clear , filling the glass with a moderate head and leaving plenty of persistent lacing . warmth and air in the last several minutes have treated it well . aroma is still skunky , but it is subdued , and is now showing off a notable toffee and caramel malt nose . flavor is a bit rough , not as smooth or sweet as expected , with balanced bitterness and carbonation , with a somewhat dry finish . important to breathe in the toffee aroma when tasting , or else it suffers excess bite . drinkability would be better if this ale was a bit softer and sweeter , maybe with lower carbonation and more dextrins , and maybe even could use some ( more ) diacetyl to round it out . really let this one warm up in the glass after opening , it only gets better as it approaches room temp . last swallow smells sweet and clean . still highly recommended , beating out its peers on either side of the lineup , old speckled hen and greene king ipa .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.40 0.40	poured into a lindeman 's flute . beer is pink and heavily carbonated , pink head , small and medium bubbles , mostly clear . looks good . has a sweet almost cough syrup aroma to it . beer is really sweet with a dryness at the end with a cough syrup like flavor on the late and midpalate . the fake cherry flavor lingers making this a very difficult beer to drink . avoid avoid avoid .

1.00 0.60 0.60 0.40 0.90	12 oz bottle poured into a bavarian pilsner a - red/amber with just under 4cm of off-white head . beautiful lacing after dissipation . s - piney and citrusy hops : grapefruit , pineapple . t - i have no idea why this is classified as an american amber/red ale . to me this is a microbrewery version of an american adjunct lager . there was a slight sweetness once the beer hit the palate , but that gave way to a subtle hop flavor and then there was a bud light like flavor that i always attributed to the rice used in their beers . no adjuncts here though , so i have no idea what it was . the hops were way weaker than the nose suggested and the malt was barely noticeable . did not taste like an amber ale at all . m - kind of watery , even for a beer of this size . d - even though i did n't enjoy this beer . i 'd drink it as a session beer to replace those foul tasting macros . it was pretty easy drinking and though the flavor was n't that off-putting , it got low marks because it did not seem like an amber ale at all . it seemed more like a stone attempt at a macro style beer . the only possible way that this beer got a gold at the great american beer festival would be if no other beers entered in its category . stones beer continue to disappoint me .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	taturbo ... thank you so much for this trade and the extras . appearance : deep black with an almost fluorescent purple head . what an incredibly unique looking beer , i 've never seen anything like it . in the light there are flecks of garnet . there is n't much lacing and the head falls flat quickly . however , the bubbles are tiny and tight , which leads me to believe the beer will be slightly creamy . i have never given an exceptional appearance before and may not for a long time . smell : pungent aroma of ripe fruit , specifically raspberries , but borderline cherries and grapes . the yeast is non-existent or overpowered . there is no bitterness detected , a tart sweetness dominates . taste : very sweet berries with a little beer flavor in the middle followed by a dry finish . what surprised me the most was that there was still a shred of beer flavor left , even with all the fruit overpowering . this is different from a framboise or the dfh 's fort . it 's a lot darker with less girly fruitiness . however , it 's totally dominated by tart , fresh fruit . mouthfeel : bubbly , rich and fruity sweetness . the lingering tartness leaves a nice dry finish that leaves me salivating for more . i am reminded of a dry-finishing berry mead ... which is the next bottle i 've opened for the evening . wine-like characteristics , with some body and appearance similarities to beer . no cough medicine flavors ! overall : although this was a last minute trade , i 'm happy i tried it . it 's quite tasty and not just another gushy fruit beer . i ca n't be sure how much was paid for this beer , but anything around $ 12 would be reasonable . i do wish that more of the belgian characteristics same through , a yeast fruitiness would have played nicely off the raspberries .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.80	a - pours a dark brown/red murky color . it really reminds me of swamp water with little head to speak of . s - nice smell with a deep dried fruit aroma , some yeast and and some cinnamon and ginger like spicing . t - taste is slightly wine like with lots of fruit , some breadyness and some malty sweetness . it 's pretty crazy because every sip is slightly different . this is a very complex beer that deserves its time to warm up and change on the tongue . m/d - mouthfeel is thick and enjoyable . a really great and complex beer that everybody should drink slowly and really enjoy all the flavors .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.40 0.50	heard a lot of good things about this beer so i was very excited to try it . the color of the beer is not all what you would expect from dipa at all . it resembles more of a american pale ale huge and also shares a similar flavor profile . smell i did n't really get a whole lot out seems there is a lot more bittering hops than flavor and aroma hops . not the worst beer of the style i 've drank but there are plenty better . hopefully they will refine the recipe and this will improve .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	looks nice . very dark brown with clear , ruby-brown edges and a thin tan cap of fine bubbles . good head retention , a bit of lacing . smells ... funky and wild . there 's the faintest hint of a stout in there , a bit of toffee and chocolate , but there 's a lot more hay , vinegar , and tartness . same in the flavour , lots of wild character and cherry tartness along with a bit of chocolate , roast and toffee . not much bourbon character . the body 's on the thin side and the carbonation 's a little high . my experience was disappointing , but not unexpected based on other reviews .

0.30 0.30 0.50 0.20 0.30	ok , well this is my third review of a `` beer of the world '' 12 pack i got for christmas , i will say one thing f thats its . if you want to read my review after hearing that . here goes ... serving=bottle appearance= bottle was green kinda skunky , biscuit , metal , just crap in overall . smell= was like a cheaper beer , your keystone , coors , skunky beer smell . taste= plain taste , no palate excitment at all . little metal , corn , taste to it . mouthfeel= dull , no flavor , just metal corn , no real hoppy flavor taste at all ... . undrinkability= just that , its water , go drink it if you like bud light , coors light , keystone , ect ... .my opinion , f stay away not a good beer . ( unless you like those beers then this is for you . everyone likes different beer . to each his own ) like i said this just my opinion .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.80	the beer pours an opaque light copper capped by a minimal off white head . there 's very little retention , despite a robust pour into the glass . the nose is simply divine i feel like i just pulled a freshly baked pumpkin pie out of the oven . aromas of gram cracker and butterscotch covered shortbread mix with sweet potato and canned dickinson pumpkin puree . coconut , cinnamon and a hint of citrus add a twist of the exotic . liquid pumpkin pie is the best way to describe the flavour . a fine pte sucre crust with a rich pumpkin filling spiced with cinnamon and allspice . this really is devilishly good everything i found lacking in previous pumpkin beers this makes up for . smooth creamy macadamia nuttiness adds another dimension . hops are nearly undetectably simple there for balance . similarly absent is the taste of alcohol despite the whopping percentage . only int he very finish does it pop up like a mischievous child . the medium body and medium low level of carbonation make for a surprisingly easy drinking beer ... dangerous ! this is the best pumpkin beer i 've ever had , hands down .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	12 oz brown bottle with the best before date clearly printed on the label . served in a snifter . pours a very dark brown with reddish tints and noticeable carbonation , when held to the light . average sized , tan head quickly dissipates , leaving sporadic lace . smell is of coffee , milk chocolate , roasted malts , and floral esters . taste is similar to the nose with the strong roasted coffee flavor , some chocolate , floral hops , and pepper . flavor is moderately acidic . mouthfeel is light to medium body , with a somewhat thin/watery texture , fizzy carbonation and a fairly clean finish . while i am not all that familiar with this style , after reading the style characteristics profile , i think this seems to fit into it pretty well , with the possible exception of the very short lived head retention . the flavor , while decent , was not as complex as i have come to expect from a belgian style brew , and the beer was surprisingly thin on the palate . overall , this was nice to try , but i doubt that i will be seeking it out again .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	looks like white grape juice . little carbonation is noted and no head is erected . i hate it when no head is erected . aroma is sweet and corny . that 's it . taste is like a mixture of 3 parts water , 1 part craft brewed lager , with a little corn to add some depth . the body of the beer is actually approaching medium and the carbonation is not overly fizzy as many macros are . still , this is n't one i 'd revisit . give me a choice of this or water on a hot summer day and i 'll drink water all day .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.70	this arrived with a big , light-tan head that had decent retention . the nose had a light sweetness to it , but frankly , it was not all that aromatic on the whole . the color was a yellowish- ( as opposed to orangish- ) amber with nebraska-quality clarity . the mouthfeel was full and thick , bordering on creamy without quite achieving it . i got a pleasantly sweetish tang on the palate with a light rye bite on the finish . it was an okay beer , but my personal feeling is that there are better ryes out there , nor was this one compelling enough to peel me away from pils ( my current fave ) . it will be brewed again before the summer is over , so my suggestion to christian heim and bill moore would be - more rye ! i know that there is an upper limit to how much can be added to the boil before it becomes a sticky , glutenous mess in the kettle , but it simply needs more rye flavor .

0.80 0.20 0.50 0.40 0.20	appearance : dark-brown/black color with a huge tan head that gradually collapses , leaving thick lacing . aroma : coffee , strong roasted malts , rubber/plastic , bleu cheese , burned wood taste : salty , bland roasted-malt front gives way to some unpleasant rubbery and solvent flavors , before fading without any noticeable hop constituent . aftertaste : overly bitter malts linger a while , creating an unpleasant effect . mouthfeel : medium-to-light body with medium-to-heavy carbonation sediment : some loose particulate matter coats the bottom of the bottle .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	22oz brown bomber without bottling date , 11 % abv a lovely , lighter shade of amber crowned with a snowy , white lasting head that leaves wonderwalls of lacing . a beautiful brew . coniferous scents mixed in with mango , guava and grapefruit . there is a slight phenolic aroma that drags the marks down a tad . they will fade ... very , very quaffable . a far maltier and juicier triple ipa than comparable brews over 11 % abv . searching the murky recessess of my fading memory and avery 's maharaja comes to mind . carbonation and viscosity is spot on , and the finish leaves me pining for a little more . unlike many other higher abv brews , ep=ph2 is not a sipper . it works that way - and it takes time to down - but it 's also a quencher that will bowl you over . beware . one of the very best .

0.50 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.80	ok , i 'll admit it , i love an ice cold corona , sue me . poured from the typical clear bottle into a pilsner glass ( this may be the first time i 've ever poured a corona , it 's destined to be drunk right from the bottle ) . pours a very pale yellow with small white head that disappears quickly leaving no lace . well carbonated so it has a small head . it has that typical skunky smell but for some reason i like that . average tasting beer , slightly skunky . i am having it without lime and in a glass to get a real taste but this beer needs the lime . thin and watery in the mouth . still , it 's a very drinkable beer . like i 've said in many other reviews of south of the border beers this is a great beer for hot , humid florida summer days . when you want to quench your thirst and do n't want water this is it . open a bottle , cram a lime down the neck and enjoy . good stuff .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	a - a golden and cloudy poor ... initial foam quickly settles combined with minimal carbonation ... once settled it reminds me of a glass of apple juice ... s - raspberry smell is obvious though it seems artificial and not authentic ... displays some cider qualities as well ... t - slightly tart raspberry taste ... not complex ... taste is much more natural than the artificial sent ... m - very dry ... light ... d - goes down easy , but not memorable ... a one and done type brew ... very few characteristics of a good hefeweizen are present ...

0.60 0.60 1.00 1.00 0.90	i have to admit from the outset that baltic porter is one of my favorite styles and have some very specific notions about what this style can and should behave . pours a dark brown with a small brown head that does not retain well , unlike several others of its class . smells roasty and ( like the back of the bottle says ) a bit like black licorice , but is remarkably understated to the point of being uninteresting . the taste , however , will knock your socks off . full-bodied , well-rounded , extremely complex and layered flavors that make you marvel at every sip . this is extremely tasty . black licorice ? check . dark chocolate ? check . roastiness ? smoke ? expresso ? check , check , check ! this beer spans the entire baltic porter flavor spectrum and does so in a very balanced way . this a suberb beer once you get it to your palate .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.90	pours a dark reddish brown with a huge off white head with huge fat lacing . smells like apples yeast banana with good amount of spice . taste is the same with a bit of alcohol comin through . mouthfeel is subpar with weak carbonation . very drinkabe for the abv .

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.80	appearance = it poured from a twelve ounce bottle with a small head that quickly dissipated without leaving any lacing on the glass . smell = it has a rich caramel nose that is pleasant taste = the taste is also rich in caramel that seems too strong at first but then quickly dissipates leaving a nice finish . a toasted caramel is also evident . mouthfeel = adequate carbonation in conjunction with the thick caramel almost balance each other . drinkability = this is an easy drinker but not quite a session beer because of the thick caramel taste and mouth feel . overall i like it and would purchase another sixer .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.70	og-11.5 p , sg=1.046 , 5.1 % abv . pours out to a clear , very pale golden , forming a soapy white head with decent retention and good lacing . carbonation is moderate . aroma of weak , floral hops with a touch of freesia , corn , and a light dryness . mouthfeel is average , watery , with a light body and clean finish . taste is predominated by corn , with hardly any perceptable hop flavor or bitterness . cleanly fermented with a crisp finish . this is a very simple beer , and only a step above budweiser . if you need to transition someone from macro domestic swill to an average pale ale , then this would be the one . comparable to the lightest tap at any new brewpub . easy to drink , but then again , why would i want to ?

0.30 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.40	an every so slight step above stuff like bud and corona . looks and tasted watered down . no flavor or character here . not a very good beer , but if i have to suck back garbage on a hot summer day , i 'd rather this than the afforementioned bud or corona .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	pretty much explodes out of the bottle with massive overflowing foam . liquid is n't so much cloudy as chunky - i guess the settled sediment was stirred up quite a bit . nose is pungent belgian yeastiness with lots of tropical fruit and sour aromas . some sharp funk and grassiness round out the nose . the flavour is much more mellow with strong banana and some orange , lemon and yeast . a little bit spicy and herbal - coriander and cloves . light body and finely carbonated . pretty drinkable .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.30 0.40	pours a nice golden color with rabid carbonation and a frothy mouth-feel . nice smokey aroma with hints of citrus . has a great mouth-feel ; hefeweizen-esque . overall flavor is quite tart , almost sour , with strong notes of lemon . finishes with a mild smokey flavor and slight saltiness . great mouth-feel , but based on the incredibly tart/sour citrus notes , i would deem it infected .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.60	purchased from great spirits , huntsville , al . a : dark black , thick brown head that dissipates slowly . s : roasted malty aroma , no hops . t : very sweet up-front , with some notes of coffee and a very dry finish . m : moderate , not watery but not overly thick . refreshing . about as expected . d : overall about average for a dry stout . not the greatest beer in the world , but fans of the style should like it .

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.70	after seeing this showing up in cans around town , i 've been pretty curious to give it a try . pours a very deep orange that 's on the verge of being nearly red . i 've only seen that color for the boldest of dipa 's . the head on this is huge , billowing , and it does n't let up at all . the smell is pure hops . piney resin filled hops . after seeing and smelling this brew , i expected an over the top dipa , but the flavor profile is normal . it 's got a great mix of fruity , piney , and even floral hops in it . not too bitter or one dimensional either . there 's a hint of malt in there that ties everything together . drinkability is really only limited by your affinity for high levels of hops . while it 's nearly 7 % abv , it does n't have too much heat or booziness to it . still , that `` wall of hops '' can be a little potent if you 're not ready for it . this is far hoppier than most ipa 's . it 's a full-on assault with dipa levels of hops , but without the booziness to cancel some of that out . luckily , the hop varieties used offer their own flavor balancing to keep everything in control . ska 's got something for the serious hopheads with this one . the fact that it 's in cans is even cooler . i can honestly see this being one of those beers that comes out of nowhere and really surprises people . edit : i 'd say i probably underestimated how good this beer actually is . it 's probably one of the top beers in the whole state and one i go back to constantly . i do n't tinker with old review numbers , but this is better than i initially judged it to be .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.90	this may be a variant , sampled at the firkin rendevous here in mid february . made with vangaurd hops . pours bronze with a minimal white head , no lacing or head retention smell : good amount of floral hops taste : frutiness & crisp hop snap mf : pretty good balance . slightly thin vg sessionability , refreshing & goes down easy : )

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.80	poured into tall wine-glass ( i was house sitting , no tulip or goblet available ) . bottled 3/4/11 1948 . this is by far the darkest saison i 've ever seen , black with just a hint of reddish-brown translucence at the edges of the glass . there was about 2 inches of of light tan head that had a relaxed rate of dissipation but left very light lacing . the aroma was a nice blend of the typical saison scents , spice , yeast and grain . that description also applies to the flavors , just a nicely done edition of the style , grain , yeast and spice . i did n't really pick up any more pepper than usual , even the the breweries website said it was brewed with pepper . the body was also about average for the style , medium , crisp and tart . drinkability was pretty good ( but then i generally find saisons to be very drinkable ) . overall , a nice beer . i 'm not sure i 'd grab another 22 , but if i saw it on tap , i 'd surely have a couple . worth trying for sure .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	the brown 33 cl long-necked bottle 's got an old-looking labeling . a picture of an old monastery . beige and brown color with a real old font . a : the pour is deep deep burgundy with a really large thick creamy off-white head . the slow dissipation leaves lacings galore . s : wheat and light roasted barley malt . frutiy ; green apples and ripe bananas , faint citric notes . some yeast ( belgian-style ) . t : roasted sweet malt . some ripe bananas , dark dried fruits , citric notes ( orange zest ) . strong coffee . m : smooth creamy medium to full body together with light carbonation . aftertaste is long and at first a bit sweet , but then the bitterness kicks in ... d : a nice beer . i 'll buy it again . a nice belgian dark ale , not very complex - it could work as an introduciton-beer to beligian dark ale .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	i poured this 12 0z bottle into a sam adams perfect pint glass . best by 3-31-11 . missed it by that much . a : clear reddish amber color , an aggressive pour produced a decent tan head , but that falls very quickly into a scant cap with scant lacing . s : rye bread , plenty of earthy hops , the sweetness is subdued . t : the malty sweetness is more pronounced in the taste , and it lingers through the middle and finish , the middle shows more earthy hops and some herbal notes , the finish starts with a faintly smoky note and finishes herbal and off-dry . m : light bodied , lightly silky texture , moderate carbonation which probably leads to this beer showing a bit sweeter than expected . o : this beer has no head , is a tad too sweet , and has some odd flavors that i do n't hate but also do n't really enjoy in a lager . i will take a pass on this the next time .

0.20 0.40 0.20 0.20 0.20	i found this slender 500ml brown bottle at the binny 's store in schaumburg , il for $ 3.69 - pretty steep for an east european beer . no freshness date or anything about the beer other than to say it was an english barleywine style beer . the beer poured a perfectly clear pale gold color , but it could n't even muster up a -finger 's worth of white head . what head there was fizzled out in less than 15 seconds and left no lacing whatsoever . the beer smelled grape-y - like a red wine ( which i guess is ok for a barleywine ) , but then there was a heavy candy-like sweetness and heavy alcohol smell under the grape smell . this stuff is awful ! alcohol upon alcohol upon alcohol . you might as well open a bottle of rubbing alcohol and drink that . i defy anyone to finish a whole bottle of this . hard candy sugar is the only other flavor . no malt , no hops , no fruit , no anything except sweetened alcohol . you ca n't keep this in your mouth long enough to give it a mouthfeel grade . total drainpour with fairly high carbonation . i ca n't believe they charge $ 3.69 for this poor excuse for a beer . avoid at all costs .

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.60	not too bad for a wheat beer . first sip on a clean pallet was fantastic , followed by a linear flavor degredation until it became a average wheat beer . wheat is tuff in my opinion . there all either amazing or just plain wheat beer . i do not taste the exstravigant flavors that some reviewers aledge to .

1.00 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	reviewing the oaked arrogant bastard ale from stone brewing company . a hearty thank you to beeradvocate user funhog for hooking me up with this one . score : 89 appearance : pours a dark red-brown color with plenty of opaque-ish ruby highlights with three fingers of cream-colored head . excellent lacing , and the head really stick around -- if not apparent by the photo ( proprietary ) . 5/5 smell : piney , citrusy hops and oak/wood up front . creamy chocolate . a little caramel and figs . oranges/tangerines and malts . 4/5 taste : very sweet caramel and citrus . hoppy with toasted maltiness . slightly bitter finish . 3.5/5 mouthfeel : medium bodied , oily and cream . low carbonation complements the viscosity well . dry , bitter finish . 4/5 overall : a very solid brew , but the original version ( arrogant bastard ale ) is better in my opinion . double bastard is even better . this beer is absolutely worth trying , but a six pack seems a bit much on quantity for me . i guess i have some `` extras '' for future ba trades . recommendation : i can certainly recommend this one to both beer geeks and casual beer drinkers , as the flavors are pretty solid and not overwhelming , but the `` oaking '' does not seem to add enough additional character/flavor to justify the ( steep ) price jump . i would most recommend this beer as one to add to a mix-a-six . pairings : hamburger . cost : $ 19.99 for a six pack .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.20 0.30	i really want to like this local brewery but something about every beer i try ends up being below average . why ? this beer , for a stout , is great looking but the taste is something very strange . bitter , filling , funky , burnt malt , oily ... i wish the best for the brau brothers but they have got to do something different . being a stout lover , i know what i am looking for and can , for the most part , look past a few problems but wow ... .with this beer , i just ca n't . come on guys ... please taste your beer before you bottle it up and send it out .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.60 0.80	appearance : dark brown with reddish highlights , slightly translucent ; ultra-thick nitro head . smell : lightly roasted barley , a bit grainy - not much of an aroma . taste : mild roasted barley , but without much actual bitterness . a subtle grainy sweetness comes through in the middle . it finishes clean and dry with no aftertaste . i 'm not too sure what else to say - it really does n't have much depth or character . mouthfeel : the nitro head gives the illusion if a thick , creamy beer ; but the body is very thin and watery . i know irish dry stouts are n't supposed to be the thickest stouts around , but this is thin even for the style . notes : now here 's a beer that 's all about image . it looks impressive , but when you get down to it , it 's completely lacking in aroma , flavor and body . it 's not terrible by any means , but it 's also not very good .

0.50 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	02.07.10 at toronado a : tawny , light brown , like murky apricot juice with no head . luckily , appearances are deceiving , because this did n't look great . s : right away , full-on brett t : nice and tart , with what seems like hibiscus flavors and some stone fruit ( maybe it is apricot ) m : stinging with sourness and carbonation upfront , but really mellows out into something smooth i love love !

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	allagash tripel reserve . bottle conditioned and offered in a 750ml ( 1 pint 9.4 fl.oz ) brown glass bottle . batch # 34 . corked with a gold colored wired frame and steel cap . appearance : a massive white head sits atop a slightly hazy golden body . the head has reasonable staying and leaves a light lacing as it slowly rescinds . classic looks and perfect presentation for a tripel . smell : crisp and very clean lines on this one . the usual suspects are lined up in the tripel beginnings ; a really good mix of fruits , some hops , spices and strong citric undertones . beautiful nose that has a very refreshing aspect when deeply inhaled . taste : excellent . highly traditional malty beginning that makes way for the spicy banana clove middle . some yeast and light grain in the middle . finishes with a really good kick of fruits and a lemony grapefruit twang . mouthfeel : a smooth , slightly sweet mouthfeel that feels as comfortable as your favorite flannelette pajamas , but it will have you sleeping naked in no time . lines the mouth with ease and hangs around for a while after the beer is consumed . drinkability : very high , especially given its strength . overall : this is one serious kick ass sexy beer . absolutely excellent and one of the best us tripels i have had to date . i want more . a big tripel cheers to murph for this one !

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	a shy color of inbetween orange and yellow . a nice foamy head that goes very fast , nice carbonisation as well . her smell is fruity , hoppy , very hoppy with some citrus flavors . taste as very hoppy , the hops hit you right away , some banana , fruity , apple , citrus and pinneapple flavours as well . that beer is also dry , the hops hit you then leave no real aftertaste , actually reminds me of a `` hit and run '' taste ! very drinkable , and the moutfeel is good

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.80 0.90	ordered a pitcher at a pre-fab resturaunt chain ( montana 's ) . as always for beers off the tap , it was the perfect temperature , just short of ice cold . it 's a solid gold with a sprightly white head . no hints , no tones toward the edges . pure gold . impressive . smelled decent , nothing to write home about . the taste was sweet from corn , but i felt it was a nice touch . they did n't overdo it . as a light beer fan , i enjoy a lager that 's low on the bitter and high on smoothness . it 's one of the most drinkable non-lights i can think of . my only complaint is with the carbonation , which hurts a lot more than it helps . the flavour would come through just fine if it were allowed to sit and lose it 's fizzyness , provided the temperature was maintained .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	12oz . bottle poured into my trusty mug . a- gorgeous . deep gold with hints of orange . tight white head , that laces down the glass . could n't be any better looking . s- i get heavy toasted multi-grain bread scents from the malts . t- taste follows the smell . really toasty on the malt bill , sweetness follows , it 's a touch fruity , but not artificially so , it 's not over the top , and a touch of hops balances on the end . the sweetness lingers around after the sip is well over . m- lighter side of medium body , pretty slick , and a touch dry on the finish . a fabulous german style lager , that i would seek out again .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.80	got this on cask at sierra nevada 's 30th anniversary at the surly goat and i have to say ... it was all right . i was n't blown away by this year 's offering , but it was a pleasant experience still . maybe that 's the free pint glass talking . poured with a massive head and beautiful lacing with a murky golden tint - i have to admit the pour was promising . the beer is n't particularly pungent - just some light citrus notes and a hint of pine ( or holly , for the season ) . celebration had a foamy , free flowing flavor that was not aggressive at all . in a way , the flavoring left a lot to the imagination ... in that i was waiting for more creativity to kick in . as it was on cask , naturally it had no carbonation , which in hindsight may have actually aided to the sharpness i have come to expect from sierra nevada .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.40 0.50	pours dark amber with a small head . nose shows loads of caramel and rich malts , with some soft spicy hops and solvent-like alcohol in there too . more sweet malt and golden sugar as flavours , but also a whack of hot/solvent-like alcohol and industrial notes , like glue . carbonation is way too high . pretty bad stuff !

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.70	this brew had a fruity aroma with a light orange transparent colored body . it poured a small head of white bubbles . it has a sweet carbonated taste and left a good lacing that stayed on the glass for a very long time . overall it was very nice and very drinkable and left a dry aftertaste .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60	dark black with creamy tan head that leaves great retention and foamy lace . the smell is roasty with burnt sugar edges , dark chocolate , coffee , and smoke . the taste is ashy . too much black patent . perhaps others enjoy this , but there is a charcoal , burnt taste that is a bit much for me . smoky , bitter chocolate , and roasted coffee . quite roasty and ashy tasting . strong with alcohol peeking through . overall an average stout .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	black colored beer with a brown head that completely fills the glass . do n't know what they can do to make it look any better . sweet smelling with lots of coffee and candied fruit aroma . fair amount of fig aroma with some chocolate and molasses smell . slight boozy kahlua scent with a trace of rum . the taste starts out sweet and roasty toasty chocolate flavor with a little vanilla and caramel . lots of flavor here gets a bit more bitter as you drink it and the rum gets a little stronger . little bit of berry taste after most of the glass is drank . good mouthfeel , tiny bubbles make it seem creamy like regular guinness . nice and drinkable , if i had a regular source i could see myself drinking this often . sampled through the efforts of northyorksammy .

0.40 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.80	straight pour from a twist-off , 355ml bottle to small tumbler ; best by of december 11 , 2011 printed on label ( 111211 ) appearance ( 2.0 ) : clear , golden body with maybe a finger of bone-white head fading quickly to a thin ring around the edge and a hazed surface . the bodys actually almost exactly what piss yellow looks like ( which is also , coincidentally , half of michigan and uscs colors ) . smell ( 2.0 ) : weak , but smells like the style should ( aside from weakness ) a little bit of biscuity malt , and some mild herbal hops . taste ( 3.5 ) : mild hop bitterness enhanced by the clean , crisp malt profile make for a moderately bitter start , followed by just a hint of pale / biscuity malt , a little chalky , with a very mild undercurrent of sweetness . bitterness comes back around in the finish , in a medicinal sort of way . mouthfeel ( 4.0 ) : smooth , velvety carbonation that covers the tongue , punctuated with bursts of little bubblesreally pretty nice . crisp , clean , really pretty smooth . overall ( 4.0 ) : this is definitely a beer whose flavor profile and mouthfeel are enhanced by the temperature at which its servedthat is to say , drink this very , very cold . when i studied abroad in brazil as an undergrad , this was my favorite of the cheap , fizzy yellow beers there . its not great , but for what it is and for what its meant forthat is to say , something refreshing and ice-coldthis is about as good as youre going to get in brazil . i dont think a lot of people share my opinion in this , but they are all wrong , for the most part .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60	thanks to whoever i got this one from . i know i did n't buy it . poured a 22oz foiled bomber into my tripel karmeliet tulip . this beer pours a light straw yellow with a massive 4 inch , pancake batter thick , cream head that left some serious lacing down the sides of the glass . reminded me of looking through lorraine swiss cheese . really a beautiful beer . the aroma is like a dirty slap in the face . dirty mushrooms , bretty earthiness , grass and just a hint of peach . the nose really has some dominant aromas in it . i 'm surprised that they work so well together . i was really looking forward to the flavor of the beer because of the appearance and aroma but man , this beer is just to `` earthy '' for me . huge barnyard earthiness , a bit of ammonia , grass , and a medical aspirin bitterness . just a bit of peach and honey come through at the very tail of the flavor profile . as much as i love what brett can do to a beer , this is just a bit too much . reading the label , it makes me wonder what the `` special belgian yeast '' is . its just a bit too much for me . the mouthfeel finished just a little too sweet . i would rather have it finish very dry . i just do n't understand avery . they try so hard to go above and beyond standard brewing processes but so many of their beers just fall flat .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.90	poured into my old man 's heinold 's first and last chance saloon pub glass . have yet to make it over there , supposedly one of california 's great historical bars . high marks for appearance . pours with almost an amber tint with a lovely fluffy head , almost like a belgian pour . the nose is pretty unremarkable . hoppy overtones with lemony hints . certainly not overwhelming . not an especially strong mouthfeel , but nice for an easy sippin ' beer . thorough carbonation makes for a happy tongue ! there 's a nice bitterness to this beer , nice medium hop profile with strong citrus notes ( like the label says ) . a good hoppy beer for someone not interested in a bomb . this beer is surprisingly light and drinks easier than most ipa 's . overall , an enjoyable brew . could stand to have another .

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.30	old milwaukee ... the beer that claims to be `` the best tasting beer in america '' according to the can . i will comment no further on the slogan and tell you what i think of the beer . old milwaukee pours a pale straw/yellow color with a foamy white head that disappears in about 30 seconds . the smell is grainy , with some husky/musty type smell and the smell of alcohol . very adjuncty smelling . the mouthfeel is watery . the initial taste is of grains , some malt , and the aforementioned alcohol . there is an unpleasing dryness/bitterness to this beer . not the kind that is welcomed in a beer . the bitterness is more like what you would find in a bottle of robitussin , and the alcohol taste tastes like it was poured out of a bottle of rubbing alcohol . quite astringent . the aftertaste is mostly clean , but the taste of corn makes its way through . the beer concludes with a little bit of alcoholic warmth . this is a cheap beer that tastes cheap . not very pleasing on the palette whatsoever . in the line of cheap beers , pabst or stroh 's is probably the way to go . stay away from this stuff .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	sample at bjs in san bruno , california . pours copper hue , with a nice , long lasting , white head and lively carbonation . light , crisp body . flavor is grapefruit hops with biscuit malt providing some balance . taste is like a light version of american ipa .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.70	picked up a bomber of this for a friend and myself who enjoy hot food and peppers . poured a orangish amber with a thin finger of very light green head . head retention is poor , and it reduced itself to edges in only a minute . lacing is mild . smell is interesting . mild pepper and smoke with a very light malt . taste is a strong sweet hop , followed suit by a sour smoked pepper flavor . finish is a bit strong , and leaves a mild heat in the back of your mouth . mouthfeel is smooth and light bodied , feels watered down a bit and i wish the pepper was strong . my overall impression of this is that its a novelty beer . i 'd drink it again for sure but because of the hop and spice mix , something i know does n't mix well with alot of foods , i 'd have a hard time pairing it , and would limit it to rare occasions when i 'd want an odd beer out .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.90 0.80	22 ounce bottle purchased from a local store for about ten dollars , split with my dad last night 2007 edition poured into my stone pint glass with a very dark brown color with a slightly red tint , light definitely goes through when it is held up to the light , 1/2 inch creamy light tan head that stuck around for several minutes , good retention , and some really sticky lacing which was surprising for a porter smell was lots of roasted and burned malt , tons of strong smokiness , charcoal scent , faint coffee aromas , toffe , caramel , sweet cream , and a hint of piney hoppiness taste was super smoky and dry right off the bat , some chewy malt that was roasted to the maxiumum , nice dry hoppiness to balance it out , once it warmed it became more sweeter , some different coffee and chocolate tastes , hint of black licorice , mostly smoked accents and bitterness when cold but sweet and creamy once it reaches room temperature , last few sips had lots of caramel and more cocoa in it , great taste overall with one of the most smoky tasting beers i have ever had body was pretty thick but it was overly carbonated to me , remninded me of the barrel aged wild dog gonzo imperial porter i had a couple months back , taste did not last a very long time though , above average mouthfeel could drink a few bombers of this and that would be about it because of its heaviness on the stomach , it is not strong and the abv is pretty low , long lasting taste that keeps you coming back for more and the alcohol is hidden well best beer from alaskan brewing company i have tasted yet , but i am expecting big things from their first bottled version of the barleywine , highly recommended , i will be putting some down for a year or two in my cellar , grab some before they are all gone , most places near me sold out already

0.20 0.50 0.60 0.60 0.50	a : really cloudy , lots of sediment , washed out yellow color . looks pretty gross , actually , like swamp water . no head , no lacing . s : lots of grain and a little alcohol and hops , but not much else . pretty plain and uninteresting . t : a little fruitier than the smell - some nice light fruit in here , a bit tangy and sweet . grain is up front and is n't bashful - nice strong taste . hops are very slightly there , but i 'd prefer more . m : overcarbonated , slightly astringent , medium-body . very dry . d : goes down ok , but i would only drink it with a meal . on its own it 's a little mundane .

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.50	a blend of stout and bock.cool ! ..hopefully better than a blend of wheat and durum ( a inside joke for anyone who has worked as a grain handler..= not a good thing ) ..i know some beer gods frown on the whole black-tan thing . this is my first , so in i dive in with my usual open-mindiness . looked like watered down cola..head fizzled fast , not a good sign as it definitely was n't too cold . hey..decent lacing . it 's really trying to give me that chocolate/coffee stout smell here..but it 's muted . some slight coffe/toffee taste initially with a hint of hop bitterness , maybe even a little nutty . but it seems to be out of balance ... hence the blending thing i guess . very , very thin and watery given it 's parent ingredients . got this in a 'beers of the world ' 8 pack so bonus.would certainly taste fairy exotic to a macro-lager person..but i wo n't be activiating my paypal account to get some more out of minn.usa anytime soon .

0.90 0.80 0.20 0.30 0.30	this beer looks very impressive . lovely rich golden colour , a heady hoppy nose , beaucoup de tiny beading and one of the thickest heads i have seen in a very long time . so obviously so well made . you can feel the potency as you bring the beer to your lips . and then everything goes pearshaped . when the beer makes contact with your tongue you are hit with a sickly cloying sappy body which just smothers all of the beer 's positive qualities . i am sure there are ale conners around the world wagging their fingers in indignation . this just so obviously lacks balance and is too much of an attention seeker for me . give me their 60 minute any day . far less than the sum of its parts . carlsberg special brew anyone ? will need to give this a few more tries .

0.40 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.40	aromas of musky , grass , herbal , hay , and a slight malt presence . the taste was very thin and disappointing , lacking the sweet , hoppy belgian flavors needed in a abbey style beer . certainly tasted grassy , with only a modest hint of maltiness and herbs , and really no evidence of spice or sugar . the mouthful is crisp with a snappy carbonation . a decent feel and fullness , reminds me of apple juice with a tart orange and apple layover on the tongue . this is a very weak version of a belgian ale . easy to quaff but there is a lack of a flavor profile that keeps you from coming back for more .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	a : nice copper in color with a nice thick head with good retention and good lacing . s : sweet fruity notes of grapefruit and orange with a nice light malt caramel like essence . t : this is a nice ipa not to bitter but loads of hop flavor . citrus orange and a spiciness . the malt character in this beer is nice and amber in flavor with light caramel notes . m : medium mouth feel with good carbonation and a nice dryness . d : buy this beer this is a really nice ipa .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.90 1.00	a : poured a dark clear ( filtered ) chocolatey amber color with a rich white foamy head . s : the aromas were a bit bland and no i did not have a cold . the aromas really came out while sipping of course but were indistinguishable before my first sip . i did get a hint of chocolate and some thyme worked in there . t : as stated above , the taste really enhanced the aromas of the beer . i definitely tasted a light chocolate and i got an after taste of thyme and hops . very delicious ! m : smooth and crisp is the best way to describe it . no slimy feel afterward . d : very good . there was no face cringing . there was a light carbonation feel that was not in anyway ruining the experience for me .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.70	a : pours a copper-orange color . a vigorous pour produced several fingers of foamy white head that eventually dissipated to about two fingers . lots of sticky lacing . s : distinct aromas sweet citrus and resiny pine . very strong notes of alcohol , very sweet caramel , grass , and grapefruit . t : very very sweet . caramel is one of the most dominant flavors in the taste . slight note of citrus and piney resin come through in the finish . surprisingly little bitterness for a dipa . it could use some too - this brew 's maltiness boarders on cloying . m : full bodied , thick , syrupy , hoppy oil . feel the alcohol warmth as it goes down . o : a fairly good ipa , but nothing to get too excited about . i would recommend this to someone that can not handle really bitter beers , but the lack of hop bitterness in this brew let to a beer that boarded on sickly sweet imho . fair , but not great .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.90	appearance : hazy and amazingly pale lemon-drop yellow body . this almost looks like lemonade as it pours out of the bottle . nice finger and a half of white head that recedes quickly and leaves decent lacing . great presentation . aroma : intense . tangy wheat , lemony citrus , and lots of spicy coriander and cloves . with the lemon , wheat , and spices this almost reminds me of a lemon meringue pie in a weird ( and good ) way . taste : zesty lemon , coriander , and cloves still dominate over a wheat/pale malt base . thin even for this style , i 'd like to see just a little more intensity in the backbone . not particularly bitter or sweet , mothership is pleasantly mellow . mouthfeel : as you 'd imagine as you watch it pour , this is very much light-bodied . good carbonation and a clean finish . drinkability : suburb drinkability , would quench nicely on a hot summer day . verdict : although a little thin , mothership wit is so smooth , drinkable , and very mellow that it works . with a nice mesh of flavors and brilliant quenching potential , mothership is another solid new belgium brew . the fact that it 's organic is just icing on the cake .

0.50 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.60	a hard pour into a tulip brought about nearly zero head . caramel-colored with a sweet malt-and-caramel smell . my expectations for this beer were kind of low since i only paid $ 1.25 for it and it had been in my fridge for a while but i quite enjoyed it ; sweet enough to taste like candy until the finish , which is when the alcohol comes out - and even then i was surprised to learn this is 8.5 % . this is a little to sweet to be one of my session beers but i enjoyed it nevertheless , and would buy it again even if it was n't so cheap .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.50	review from notes in december 09 this beer reminds me of why i 'm not a mead drinker . quite a beautiful beer , but that 's about all it has going for me . very honey sweet and a strange hop bitterness that does n't quite work for me . yes , honey and hops is good in hopslam , but this is completely different . thinnish body and low carbonation .

0.20 0.30 0.20 0.20 0.20	impulse buy at check-out at trader joe 's . have a feeling it 's going to be bad and already regret the purchase by the time i get home . appearance : huh looks like a lager . 'bout like budwieser with less head . that head run 's for the hills and it 's gone in 10 seconds ... smell : night quill and cinamnin ... no pumpkin to be found . like fake cookies or something ... not so pleasant taste : now that 's bad . god # # # i have a six pack of this ? ! ? i think i 'll give this away to trick or treaters or something . i 've had some decent pumpkin ales before . this is budwieser with cinamnin . again no pumpkin flavor anywhere in this brew . and it 's worse than bud ... this is no ale btw mouthfeel : at this point who cares but yeah it 's thin . drinkability : low because it 's horrilbe tasting . this is a bad joke . i would drain pour this but i 'll just plug by nose and drink it for the buzz . the 5 bucks spent on this sixer could been spent on a 12 packs of hamm 's and i would be much happier . this is my new worse beer ever .

0.20 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.70	straight up pour gets a one finger head that instantly fades to nothing - no carbonation , medium bodied . ugly cloudy amber color . raisin nose . starts sweet and raisiny , finish is sweet alcoholic . different from any barleywine i have had ; once you get past the cap - who was the sadist that put wax and nylon tape on this - it ai n't gon na explode ? ! $ 5.99 for a 12oz bottle ( 2004 ) from julio 's liquors westborough , ma .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	330ml bottle poured into tulip dec9 2010 a super hazy golden orange with tiny suspended particles being move around by a shitload of bubbles . a gentle pour leaves a massive 3 finger head that forms a dome over the top of the glass and just sits there for a while ever so slowly falling to a thick film with a island in the middle that looks like a little brain s a little yeast and pineapple with some other fruits i ca n't quite place and some booze t what i smell but with a little more booze , some cereals and a nice little blast of hops . again there 's something i ca n't quite place , it 's nothing bad though almost like apple pie filling with toned down spice m quite active it the mouth with plenty of bubbles and a little bite , it 's a little hot for 8 % but not too bad d only the look of this one blew me away but it was n't lacking anywhere . i doubt i 'd drink many of these back to back but one or two is quite enjoyable i get more then twice the triple when i grab a 750ml bottle of la fin du monde , i like this beer but it 's hard buy when it 's beside lfdm on the shelf

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70	this one is really impressive out of bottle , with a deep , opaque brown-to-black color topped by a huge , fizzy beige head that settles to a persistent ring . the aroma is pleasantly sweet and earthy , with a predominant vanilla character over a light roasted quality that was reminiscent of white toast . the flavor is sadly more one-dimensional , with the same vanilla character and some dark caramel being only modestly balanced by a dark roasted coffee bitterness . a light , prickly carbonation cuts through a medium-weight body , which combines with a slight astringency to make this one harsher than would be desired . in the end , the sweet yet roasty profile is enjoyable enough , but it does n't make this beer any more than a nice but unremarkable porter .

0.60 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90	this brew poured a small head of fine to mediumly sized off white bubbles and a transparent brown body . with a very mild malt aroma , the flavors and plalate of this brew are definately its stongest points . the flavor is very complex with notes of spice , roasted caramel , malt , sugar sweetness and a noticeable alcohol content . it has a good mouthfeel with a lingering tongue numing sensation .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	live review a- clear straw yellow . very cabonated , foams up big but dissaptes fast to have no head whatsoever s- strong scent , sweet , malty t- clean taste , sweet malts , grassy , surpisingly a yeasty afternote m- watery and very light d- not the tastest of beers , but one that can lead to very adventrous nights

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	this would be the perfect beer for the pool party where you want something good and easy drinking ... and one the bud drinkers can handle ... .a tasty lager that tastes like a lighter helles style ... it is a slightly hazy golden in color ... .the nose is grainy malts ... body is light but not overthin ... about right for a lager ... i rate the drinkability high because this is an easy drinking lager that has some real nice sweet maltiness to it ... .for a lager this is tasty..just a quick twang of spicy hops on the very long finish ... other than that this is all sweet malt ... .a very enjoyable lager i would recommend as a great lawnmower beer..

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.50	wonderful looking ale . crystal clear , deep burnt gold in color . nice head , around 1 finger , yet it dissipates quite quickly . malty nose with some funkyness . very little hoppiness on the nose ... very little . carmel smell . sweet smelling . bleh . malty funky taste . the grape is not doing it for me . it 's a nice octoberfest-like taste . cloyingly sweet . not very impressive . sticky sweet mouthfeel . it 's very good in this respect . i find this beer not very drinkable . for some reason this beer did n't really click with me . it 's too weird and packed with non-beer tastes .

0.60 1.00 0.60 0.90 0.70	what the hell is this , tequilla beer ? even the bottle looks like a tequilla bottle with a resealable cork . made with agave , almost 20 % abv , and generously shared by halcyondays , i had no idea what i was going to get . on to the beer : muddy orange in color , with no head forming on top . no real legs either . it looks like someone melted some butterscotch candy to make the liquid . the nose was interesting ... okay , the anticipation was . i thought it would be along the lines of cazadores , but one whiff lit up my nose ! it 's nothing like tequilla , and instead smells like dessert . brown sugar , massive maple , custard ... hard to believe you could get this out of agave . let 's see , it 's really sweet , and really tasty . you could make creme brulee out of this beer . i want to say maple donuts are what this beer reminds me of . thinking of this flavor is teasing my taste buds , and they want me to buy a 12-pack of krispy kreme 's at this minute . what 's further amazing is that the alcohol is buried scary well ; you 'd think patrick rue helped these guys . the one majorish criticsm is the thin mouthfeel for such a big beer . not carbonated either , but having some would probably make things worse . it 's no utopias , but what is ? sonoran 200 is a great tasting drink , and perhaps one of the best beers to pair with dessert . you 'd think the tickers would be all over this beer .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.40	appearance - cloudy dark red , 2 fingers of creamy head with good retention and lacing . smell - fairly strong passionfruit-like hops . taste - the passionfruit in the aroma is barely detectable in the flavour , which is dominated by burnt caramel-like malts . the hops are too spicy , and do not provide enough fruity counterbalance to the malts . mouthfeel - medium bodied . definitely too cloying for the style . drinkability - not an easy drinker by any standards . overall - this is certainly a flavoursome beer , but too much of the flavour is burnt and metallic .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.50	picked this up at auchan ... brewery is in lille but on the can it says `` canned in holland . '' ingredients are also listed : `` water , barley malt , wheat , rice , sugar , hops . '' a-poured a nice clear amber-golden color w/rich frothy off-white head , good retention , and some sticky bits of lacing . a nice-looking brew . s-sweet grainy husk , bits of hops , slightly skunky , faint hops , bits of mineral . t-decent roasted malt backbone , bits of red apple , but it 's overly sweet and a bit syrupy . there 's a burnt/roasty sensation and a metallic feeling midway that carry through the finish . aftertaste sports remnants of faint hop bitterness , minerals , and the sugar . m-sweetness dominates , mouthfeel is a bit slick and the metallic and mineral sensations on the back of the tongue are a bit intense . carbonation is good . d-not a fan , but in a weird way i can almost pretend i 'm drinking iced tea after you get down halfway . i was able to finish this one without forcing myself , and it has some admirable qualities . i think the brewery just wanted to get in on the malt liquor market , since you do n't have to try very hard to beat most of the competition . this candidate , despite its shortcomings , has fewer than most of the competition .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	i have to go with the label and agree that the color is a `` deep chestnut '' . there is a nice load of egg white foam on top that leaves copious amounts of lacing down the inside of the glass , as opposed to those leave it on the outside of the glass , i guess . there 's a sulfurous element in the nose that throws this whole experience off ... every aspect except the look of it , which was nice . but the nice ended at first whiff . it almost smells like a crock of french onion soup topped with caramel ( malts ) rather than mozzarella . it 's there in the taste as well , but not as strong . this smell and taste must come from the hops . i 'm used to nice grassy notes from czech hops , but they must have a variety close to summit hops to achieve that smell and flavor . the onions aside , there 's a quick sweetness at first sip that is brutally wiped away by a lingering bitterness that seems greater than the advertised 35 ibus . this one goes into the `` miss '' column for the 100 barrel series . i was looking forward to it , due to my fondness for czech hops , but that 's a generalization and there 's obviously czech hops that i do n't care for .

0.70 0.30 0.40 0.20 0.30	more like flying dog-shit ale , if you ask me . i thought i bought a beer , not a bottle of stale , old grapefruit juice . this hoppy beer poured a not bad looking pale orange color , with a decent white foamy head . that 's about it though . i get heartburn from to much citrus , and the first whiff of this dog , had me reaching for the tums . taste was exactly like the smell ... huge grapefruit rind , that 's been sitting on the kitchen counter for a week . i usually like a little citrus kick with a summer brew , but this is ridiculous . i ended up finishing the beer , but i would steer clear of this one , unless you like stale grapefruits . i guess they reeled me in with the whole flying dog bit , but i wo n't be drinking this again .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.80	aroma is pretty grainy , two-row and crystal , with a bit of hop aroma mixed in . clean with no fermentation aromas . nice golden color with a solid pure white and lasting head . head leaves a serious amount of lace on the glass . really a great looking pint of beer . it screams , `` drink me now ! '' first flavor is grain . a lot like cheerios , a little sweet , and a little nutty but mostly cereal . light hop bitterness which is appropriate for a light blond ale . there is also some fruity esters particularly in the aftertaste . a little tiny bit of grassy hop flavor . nice refreshing and easy drinking flavor . body is on the low end of medium but i would n't call it light . very nice delicate carbonation level . a very nice easy drikning , or chugging to quench your thirst summer beer . not something i go for very often but a nice job .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	smeels more like a `` blanche '' than a pale ale . coriander and fruity spices are the first things i detect just by smeeling it . faithful to it 's belgian look , this brew has the bottle fermentation appearence to it , you can see and almost feel it 's roundness . now the taste ... heavy ! you can actually feel it go down which you find more in a trippel or a malt beer than a pale ale ( ! ? ! ) slite change of pace when your halfway done . this brew turns out to have a more `` domestic '' brew caracteristics to it . an appreciative bitterness when you take a sip but it does n't stay as much as you 'd like . although this beer is fairly well balanced there is still something missing ... imo .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	poured chilled in tall ale glass a : three-finger head ; cloudy orange-yellow ; very nice carbonation ; sweet sheet of lacing s : pleasant , gentle lemon hanging over yeasty smell t : very smooth , pleasant wheat beer ; clarity of the flavor is amazing ; low hopped ; great solid rendition of the classic purity laws m : decent this is a really solid , surprising beer ; ideal to give someone who normally dislikes wheat beers .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	served cold into a imperial pint glass . even allowing the beer to settle , upon popping the cap , the sediment immediately rises into suspension . so it has a hazy redish color with creamy white head . the cap lasts a long time and leaves some lacing behind . aroma is bready , yeasty and fruity . pleasant overall and suitable for the style . flavor is more of the same - nice malt base with mild hops . caramel apples and toasted wheat bread . mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation . the alcohol is present but not as strong as 7.8 % would suggest . overall a decent version but not the best .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured into a standard pint glass big , frothy two-inch head , burnt-orange in color aroma-lots of piney hops and citrus taste-big , bold juicy hops and piney citrus-intense , unrelenting flavor-definite spiciness throughout , with some subtle maltiness that gets noticed for a second , then gets crushed under an iron boot of hops , overall , big , and thick deep-throating of hops , not for the faint of heart , and almost a bit too much for one beer to handle .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	a very good porter , poured dark ruby brown color with strong tan head that i impatiently dove into smelling its aroma of chocolate , burnt malt , sweet caramels and hops . the flavors are heavily malts , complexed with caramel and molasses , espresso beans and cocoa powder . moderate level of hops for sn , but enough for a nice finish . the mouthfeel is a medium for the style very creamy and smooth when held in mouth . drinkability is great . no flaws here . going to have this again in about an hour . --

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.40	poured from a 22 oz . bottle purchased at lone hill liquor in glendora , ca , into a 16 oz . tumbler . the crown cap under the wine bottle foil cap ( a quirk of dale bros. bottles ) bears the handwritten number 627 . appearance : dale bros. pomona queen california amber lager is an attractive , bright gold-amber color that is perfectly clear . the beer does n't form much of a head , even with a vigorous pour . swirling the glass leaves lacing on the glass which is good looking but short-lived . smell : the smell is a let-down , after such a good start . this is the 3rd beer i 've had from dale bros. which has far too much butter ( diacetyl ) in the nose . i understand that small amounts are desirable in certain styles , but this much butter in the aroma is not a feature , it 's a bug . working around that , i get a burst of crisp lager smell , some clean and sweet malt , and a bit of red apple peel . as the beer warms slightly , it reveals a note of cooked oatmeal . rather odd . taste : similar to the smell , in that the buttery character makes it hard to get an handle on anything else . there 's a moderate malty sweetness up front , and a grainy finish with a light tea-like hoppy astringency at the end . in between is just too much butter . mouthfeel : medium-bodied and unpleasantly slick . carbonation is too low as well . drinkability : maybe i 'm just too sensitive to diacetyl , but in this beer it adversely affects the smell , taste , and mouthfeel . i only made it through half the bottle , and that still felt like several sips too many . if i saw it on tap somewhere i 'd probably try to talk the bartender into giving me a sample , just to compare it to the bottle . but if i had to make a decision based on this bottle , i would n't try it again , nor could i recommend it .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	12oz & gt ; chilled cbx pint glass . darkness . not like motor oil , more like tobacco water . head is off-white & quick , not much left but a film . smell indicates the `` black ipa '' description i 've heard of this puppy -- it 's all roast + hops . oh yea , ok , black ipa . obvious . why they are even fooling with the name `` porter '' is beyond me . it 's damn near a hop bomb . all those bitter twangs going off on the back of my tongue , more roast up front . digging the mouthfeel . hops are keeping the creaminess away . not too thick either . again the ipa qualities win out here . very drinkable . i get a real dry finish from porters , maybe it 's relative to the color , but that dryness coupled with the hops makes me want more & more each sip i take . it 's like heroin pringles .

0.60 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.90	pours a nice shade of gold , but filmy . really nice head . the smell is a fresh smell this is by no means watered down . taste is awesome . really clean , fresh , and un-watered down taste . goes down smooth with no bite or aftertaste even trying really hard to tell . i paid $ 7.50 in a specialty store in alabama for this bottle ( most i have paid for a bottle in a store as of this date ) and i am not disappointed at all . the bottle with the corked top is no marketing scheme . has the year on it for some reference to its freshness which taste fresh . i am really going to enjoy drinking this beer ! **edit** turns out the bottle i bought for so much was a larger version of the same beer in my frig . i will give the small , cheaper priced , bottle to my girlfriend to try .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.90	on-tap at sweeny 's in st. paul , poured into a pint glass . enjoyed on a beautiful spring afternoon on the patio , sun beating down . a-arrived with a copper beer , slightly hazed and with a brownish hue . tannish head was attractive when it arrived , but quickly receded to nothing . s-relative to hop devil , this one has a more subtle american hop presence , likely subdued by the more prominent twangy brett characteristic . however , this did not overwhelm what was otherwise a pretty delicate aroma . t-the flavor was very much like the aroma , with perhaps a little bit more malt presence . the first flavor i noticed on my first sip was , of course , the twang/sour/funk of the brettanomyces . this , however , was not a slap-in-the-face flavor , but instead a nicely intertwined characteristic which played off the somewhat subdued american hops and biscuity malts . this beer finished crisp , clean , and dry , making it one of the more refreshing and drinkable brews i 've had recently . especially appropriate for sitting outside on a warm day ! m-felt medium-light bodied on my palate , with a carbonation that seemed borderline effervescent . of course , it was realistically a more medium-high carbonation level , but the relatively lighter body made me perceive higher carbonation . d-this is an enjoyable beer . as i 've already stated , the brett addition makes this ipa much more refreshing on a summer day , while being well-balanced within the rest of the beer 's character .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.40 0.50	i had this in bottle 2 years ago and it tasted much more balanced than just having it currently on tap . tastes extremely bitter , reminded me of chinook on steroids . but looking at their site chinook are n't used . simcoe , columbus , cent and cascade . whatever the hop schedule was , i do n't care for it . must be a hell of a lot of columbus and cascade . grapefruit city . normally bitter beers i can deal with but not enough sweet malt to counter balance for me . just seemed one dimensional . one and done for taste buds . sorry .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 1.00	what a wonderful beer ! thanks muenchenerkindl ! ahhh . i was worried , you see , when i sat down to review this beer . i had drank it on a previous occasion and fell in love with it . but i was in a pils-y mood today and picked up some budweiser ( the real budweiser ) today and drank it before this guy , so i was worried about how it would hold up to that greatness . but it really is like comparing apples to oranges . troegs is a very faint , almost macro-lager yellow , almost definately not decoction mashed . but it smells pleasant . earthy and citrusy hops in the nose . ohhhh , both a once ! wonderful ! the taste follows the nose . it is crisp and refreshing . like biting into an apple on a summer 's day . it does n't taste like an apple at all , but that is what it makes me think of . wonderful ! the mouthfeel is good for a pils . it balances the line between too thin and too thick . in the end , i think it is not quite thick enough but it is still amazing . drinkability ? it 's a well made pils man . is there anything more drinkable out there ?

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.70	the beer poured a dark amber with a tan head that left a bit more than lace . the aroma was of malt and floral hops . the taste was of sweet malt and floral hops with a bitter hops finish . the feel was medium and wet with a drying finish . a very pleasant pale ale . good job on a session style pale ale , nice floral hops without getting into the massive overbittering .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.70	poured into a 16 oz becher , a near opaque dark brown with a huge rocky head and plenty of sticking foam , truly gorgeous , then it the wheels come loose from the cart . nose is missing any discernible character and the taste is mildly roasty malts with an even milder ashy hoppiness . the finish is like the morning after a smoking binge of tipparillos . mouthfeel is way to thin and light . this is drinkable but not exciting . the let down from the beauty pour is deep . part of the `` adirondack trail mix '' purchased at total wine in midlothian for $ 4.99 for the whole 6-pack .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	22 oz . bomber , a : pours mahogany with a small off-white head , fair retention , light lace . s : lots of brown sugar , dates , molasses . t : sweet malt dominates . dark fruit , caramelized brown sugar . sweet and to the point . not really boozy . m : full-bodied , never really cloying for how sweet it is . soft carbonation . elegant finish . o : great qpr , something this big for only $ 8 a bomber . i miss it at $ 5 , but what are you going to do . this could age forever , so much sugar and ethanol .

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	thanks to steve for this one . sampled the 2001 and 2000 vintages side-by-side . review is for the 2001 vintage though there will be comments about the 2000 throughout . 4oz . pours from capped and corked 750ml bottles into matching wine glasses . reviewed at a tasting 2/19/11 . from notes . a : pour generates a small ring of white head that dissipates quickly . beer is a slightly cloudy yellowish-white peach . lacing is minimal and with little stick . the 2000 vintage is surprisingly much more carbonated . more head , more lace and darker beer color overall also . still , pretty much what i 'd expect from a gueuze . s : nose is sharp cheese , overwhelming horse-blanket and brett funk , wet wood , and notes of tart lemon pulp and ripe sour peaches . very aromatic and impressive overall . 2000 vintage is much more earthy and grassy with a much more woody presence and significantly less sharpness and funk . t : opening is accented by a sharp , lemon and sour apple tartness . notes of stale and damp air , wood , and blankets of brett funk . mild sour peaches at the middle and end with a building sourness right at the end . finish is moderately dry and puckering with no aftertaste . very well done . 2000 vintage is much less sour and with more of a bitter , grassy , yeasty presence . m : light to medium bodied and near still . oily and silky in the mouth . saliva-generating . puckering and moderately dry . very slight graininess going down . crisp , clean , and dry finish . no aftertaste . very appropriate and the combination of dryness and a slightly prickly finish is what makes this one . d : what is surprising about this beer is the stark contrast between the 2000 and 2001 vintages . 2001 was , in my opinion , far and away , a superior beer with more funk , more tartness , and simply more character . still , regardless of the vintage , seek this one out and sit on it . a gem of a beer .

0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.90	muwahahahaha . slipped down to bob 's on wednesday , i called first to verify and i was told that it would probably run out today . i had no other choice . pumped into a shaker pint , i expected a snifter but oh well . a- this is a cloudy little number , even more so than regular creeper . its a totally opaque , bruised fruit color . mostly orange with toasted tans and browns in the shadows . a loose , soapy head sits atop for a long duration . s- oh how i love the smell of creeper . adding oak mellowed this aroma big time . it really gets into barleywine territory , but i 'd rather not get into the style debate over this beer . this really smells like an orange creamsicle . the fresh pineapple got toned back , blending into a strong tangerine aroma . oak is strong , giving this a very woody and vanilla bend . the characteristic pineapple is not lost , however . its hides beneath , coming out with a few swirls . t- wow , this has really mellowed but its become insanely smooth . sweet vanilla and freshly cut oak sapling is first to the tongue . it keeps the full potency of the strong citrus from grasping the tongue but it does n't cock block , it blends and flows and hides the already obscured bitterness . the bright hops win the fevered battle by the end , leaving a perfect tropical fruit calling card . the finish is hoppy but plenty of woody residuales are left behind . m- as if creeper was n't thick and velvety enough , they stuck it in a cask . this leaves the beer feeling intensely full bodied and silky smooth . carbonation is but an afterthought . the finish dried out with lots and lots of woody grittiness left on the tongue . d- i always have to watch myself when i drink creeper . with all of the saftey features removed this stuff is dangerous . this pint drained at a frightening pace . bravo cbc , well played . i hope to see more of these experiments in the future . a little birdie told me i wont have to wait long ...

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.50	dark brown color with some ruby red edges . no head on this cask ale . smell is dark fruit with alcohol . i 've never had a beer this light in abv that smelled so strongly of alcohol . alcohol flavors come through a bit . also there was some coffee on the tongue . hops were a bit light but there was some bittering and flavor to them . this was my first cask ale . maybe i do n't know how to review them , but to me the mouthfeel did n't feel right . i 'm not used to it , but the low low carbonation did n't sit right in my mouth . little tough to drink at such a warm temperature . alcohol was too strong for its style .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.70	review from beeradvocate magazine issue # 38 ( mar 2010 ) : out-of-control yeast is easily lifted by the carbonation to instantly cloud this brew 's ap- pearance as soon as the cap was popped ; excellent head retention though . dried apples , eucalyptus , musty yeast and dried grass in the nose . dry , dry and dry . maltiness tastes of crackers , husky animal feed and hay . quick splash of tropical fruit within the spike of alco- holic warmth . hops ? light bitterness and a vague flavor that disappears quickly is all that is said from the vining flower . ends dry , a little yeasty and husky . it just does not have the spark that many other tripels hold ; aside from the yeast , it is easy to sip .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.80	light amber beer was topped by a thick head that left some of the thickest lacing i have seen in my career . nice nutty aroma , smooth taste with some nutty malt balancing the spicy hops . very thick creamy mouthfeel , not all like the u.k. cask beers . still a great beer and drinkability is good . excellent establishment as they always have two cask offerings

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	i 've been gifted this beer a few times over the past couple of years , & it 's never failed . pop of the cap released a relaxing scent of blueberry muffin mix . smells a little sweeter then they naturally should be , but i have n't even gotten around to pouring it out yet . it pours out a rich velvet black . inch of cookie dough-colored head . it actually looks like a chewy chips ahoy is just sitting there in my pint glass . i 'm left with a pretty sludgy empty bottle . smell is of fudge , cooked blueberries , & lots of sweet unfermentables , giving the berries more of a dipped , artificial scent . the blueberries are much more subtle in flavor , still coming off buttered & baked ( ca n't really be helped unless you 'd rather just have the finished beer sit on the berries ) , & simply lacing the base stout . the beer has a bigger then average roast , but smooths the edges out with some lactose ( almost tastes like yogurt ) . sharp malt sweetness & a creamy microbeaded feel . endgame is coffee/tobacco & toasty grain . it drinks like a much , much bigger beer . one of my favorite fruit stouts .

0.90 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	served from nitro can into standard pint glass . like most nitro beers , this one looks great . cascading bubbles leads to 1 inch white thick white head that lasts and lasts . beer itself is a clear dark golden color . no visible carbonation . very faint , beery smell with maybe some hops . neither malt or hops very prominent in the taste . ends with some bitterness . slight metallic taste . mouthfeel like typical nitro beer . smooth and light . not much carbonation . overall this beer is easy to drink and session . there is not anything offensive but also not much to impress . it is much like most other nitro beersit looks great but things are downhill after that .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.70	seems like this cheap import is on sale every week at winn-dixie . since i 'm a poor college student i decided to pick up a 12 pack of del mar for $ 8.99 . this pours a light , watery yellow with a medium-sized , but thin head . smell is adjunctish , but not terrible . this was n't skunked due to being in a box , but since the bottles are clear i could easily see it happening . taste is watered down and cheap-tasting . a slightly sweet finish keeps this from being too terrible . drinkability is okay , mainly because this is n't bad tasting enough to loath . all in all , i see this as a cheap price-cut option to corona that might taste a tiny bit better .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	found this gem in corked 25 oz . at dunmore deli . a - deep black with ruby hues . opaque throughout . beautiful tan head with steady retention . s - not much there . a faint hint of brown sugar and cocao . t - starts off with strong alcohol flavor followed immediately by the brown sugar . dark chocolate in the middle . leads to a burnt coffee taste with a very dry , sour finish . fig and plum overtones . m - very thin for a stout , even of the belgian variety . d - actually , extremely drinkable . i could see myself having a few of these in a sitting . i f price was no option of course . i was very excited to find this beer , but was a little let down . i would recommend a try , however , if you can get your hands on it . but , i would prefer a de dolle for my belgian stout . cheers !

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	it sits golden in the glass , partially obscured by haze , and stacked high with sticky , lingering white suds . the nose exudes the flatulent-like rubber notes , dandelion , sourdough , and clover . in the mouth , it 's much of the same . a canvas of sourdough is painted with a collage of weeds and herbs : a vague mustard sourness ; lemongrass citric herbals ; leafy clover ; lavender ... and i do n't do enough gardening to continue . but that 's all there is here . the flagrant herbal and floral traits of the beer would have been better suited with a more complex yeastiness . and the malt end does n't add any particular intrigue either . texturally , it medium+ in body , lowly carbonated with a slightly tacky and chalky finish . this is my first let down from great lakes . it 's pretty much a total miss and not worth retooling . bring back moondog .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.90 0.90	dulle teve is one of my favorite tripels ever . if you can find this try it immediately . it 's so unique , but has the tripel flavor profile down perfect . it pours heady . the first thing you notice is it 's swirling yeast and deep unfiltered haziness . not what i expect from a tripel , but it 's beautiful none the less . it might make duvel drinkers nervous , but it is worth investigating . the nose is fragrent and full of spice . some softer notes of grass and citrus dance over this very foamy , carbonated brew . a strong tripel that is upfront about it 's alcohol . this one kicks back . but it 's floral hop and spicy nose help make the alcohol astringency tasteful almost therapeutic . at no point did i make the alcohol sting face . i 've tasted everything from white plum to baked apple in this malty dynamo . hangs well on the tongue , but is n't the smoothest brew out there . i could drink quite a few of these mad ladies in one night , but you kinda have to pace yourself . this is a true sipping beer . enjoy .

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.60 1.00	guinnes is my favorite beer . it has a wonderfully complex taste and years of tradtition behind it . it may be overrated , but really you will be hard pressed to find a better beer unless you are a real snob . i lament that price i have to pay for it , however , which ussualy leaves me drinking horrible beers like natural ice instead of guiness . if money is not an issue , you ca n't go wrong with guinnes .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	picked this up with several other winter warmers singles at half time beer store in poughkeepsie . i drank it and was spiced out . peculiar taste with lots of spices and that is about it . i drank the whole things , so it was no terrible . on the other hand it was not really very beer like . i would not buy one again . i wo n't break it down into detail , other than to say try it if your curious but that would be the only reason .

0.70 0.40 0.30 0.30 0.20	pours a dark gold color . smells malty and metallic , and a bit of alcohol . taste ? this has a taste ? mild metal and malt possibly ? damn close to flavorless . ok maybe it has a rusty nails flavor , but it sure is n't good . mouthfeel is water . drinkability ? well i did n't puke ! leaves a nasty lingering something on your tongue !

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50	what the hell did i just get myself into ? this beer pours a cloudy amber hue with a thick head that slowly settles . lacing is sticky and coats the glass . smell is somewhat off , with a cider-like aroma and some caramel malt . almost like oxidization of a wine . taste is a bit better , with some caramel malt notes , along with some floral hops . creamy mouthfeel and a dry finish express the style , although the smell and flavor did n't do it for me . session ale ? no . this beer just seems wrong in many ways . sorry , but maybe a third brother could come in to make this beer right .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.80	from notes taken on 9/7 , on tap at the armsby abbey . i dont know what the deal was with this , but as my review shows , something was definately off . a - clear light amber pour with a nice light one finger pour that results in very gentle lacing . s - very , very light funk/brett aroma and sour citrus . incredibly muted aromas . t - whats going on here ? in all honesty , this doesnt really taste like any wild ale i 've ever head . i really doubted that i was given the right brew . anyways , very , very weak flavors . tastes like watery citrus and watery funk . very shocked and confused . m - low carbonation but not in a syrupy sense . just feels well , watery . talking macro watery . d - i know damn well this is a good beer but what happened with this pour ? bad batch ? a mispour ? something happened here that just wasnt good . such a shame too .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.70	12 oz can poured into pint glass a : pours opaque black , with about 1 & 1/2 finger head ... nice & tan . good head retention very nice lacing . s : little dry malty aromas with a hint of hops , little dark chocolate and coffee mixed in . t : i 'm getting a malty sweetness up front with coffee and bitter chocolate ... . there is the normal bitter hops at the end & a little on the dry side . average stout ... nothing to write home about . m : little thinner than i thought . still is mid bodied ... .can does says : serve extra cold , but the mouthfeel and overall taste got better as it warmed up . d : you can not go wrong with a low abv irish stouts . you could drink a few of these . not a bad stout but you could find a little better .

0.40 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.40	in nebraska we claim buffalo bill cody as our guy . seems that these california brewers have co-opted him for their beer . i 'm a big pumpkin fan , let 's see how this goes . the pour is cloudy with a quickly disappearing white head . lacing is negligible . the color is not a pretty orange , with a lot of haze . the aroma reminds me of old pumpkins , when they get squishy and start to shrivel and a dash of cloves . not appealing . the taste hits you hard with cloves and not much else . the spices stay with you for awhile after the drink , a definite plus . not a great beer . pretty drinkable with biscuity flavors , but the tough nose is a lot to get past .

0.40 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.80	poured from 12oz bottle . a- poured a clear yellow color ... almost fake looking . one finger white head dies almost as soon as it got there . no lacing on the glass . s- some lime aroma of course but mixed into a sweet corny grainy malt body . take a bmc add lime to it and it smells like this beer . t- this is not overbearing in the lime flavor . sweet flavor overall that i ca n't put my finger on . tastes like mich ultra with lime added for light flavoring . really nothing much else . m- light mouthfeel . carbonation is high for the style but not the company . crisp and clean tasting . sweetness left on the palate and in the aftertaste both . d- this beer is well ... .drinkable . i do n't care for the flavor of it but the low abv and the lack of any real flavor gives it amazing drinkability . oh michelob you make me smile once again with your mastermind .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.90	pours a pale golden , with not much of a head . it quickly dissipates , leaving basically nothing in terms of lacing . lots of yeast and hoppy fruity notes in the nose . taste is fantastic , with a great yeast presence , and fruity , apple/pear presence . mouthfeel is where this ale really stands out . great carbonation , with a full body , yet not heavy at all , and in fact , very bright and lively . one of my favorites of this style so far , and extremely drinkable , especially in warm end of summer weather .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a really good cottony head but the body is a lighter orange rather than dark amber or even banana yellow . smell is biscuity sweet caramel malts and touch of tropical fruits . should probably note that best by date is next week . i guess it at about 3 months . what it does have in the smell it has a lot of . much more hoppy than i expected . bitterness especially hits in the end . biscuity and caramel malts dominate with that tropical zing in the end and a healthy dose of bitterness , especially at 3 months old . i do n't recall caring for this last year but it seems pretty stellar right now .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	i had this beer casked poured from the grey lodge in philadelphia . the appearance was there for sure . it poured a thick brown /black with a nice tan two to three finger head . i could smell the chocolate malts and coffee mix as soon as it was placed in front of me . it had a nice earthy taste to it with well balanced hops , coco , and coffee . nice and smooth when on the palate , very enjoyable . very easy to drink . especially when poured from a hand pumped cask .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.70	16oz can into a duvel tulip . a : a straight pour fills the glass perfectly with a clear medium orange-amber body and three fingers of frothy white head that just barely peek over the rim . good retention and light , sticky lace . a little lighter in color than i might like for the style , but otherwise a magnificent-looking beer . s : not really much to the aroma - corn , caramel malt , and just a hint of herbal hops . pretty forgettable . t : follows the nose , but provides significantly greater malt complexity - bready , toasty , and lightly sweet caramel notes all lead the way to a clean finish featuring some hop bitterness . still not especially great , but inoffensive and even slightly enjoyable . m : fairly light body with a huge amount of spiky carbonation . a little overbearing . d : not bad for the style , but not great for the low abv . easy enough to drink in large quantities , and yet just heavy enough to make such an endeavor less than fully appealing . notes : always a safe choice , but never a particularly thrilling one , yuengling perplexes me with the amount of adoration it elicits . granted , most of the people i know who worship this beer usually drink budweiser , so this is a huge step up . still , i ca n't help but think that the whole `` america 's oldest brewery '' thing sells more beer than the actual recipe . it is far better out of a can than the green bottle , though . cheers !

0.60 0.80 1.00 1.00 1.00	im not a beer enthusiast , i just love the taste of beer , i dont care how it looks , or anything like that i just drink the stuff , i tried this beer today being a fan of the ofallon wheat and gold , and i was surprised . the beer is darn good , i finished of the 6 pack in 45 minutes . its like a porter light . its listed as a bock ale , but i say is a porter light. , just enough chocolate . great beer . ( and im buzzed after 6.. another plus )

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60	this beer pours really dark , with a nice tight off white head . there is good lacing throughout . the aroma is a bit off . there are some really fruity notes that overwhelm the roasted malt chocolate flavors , which themselves are nice . the taste follows , but some of the fruit is muted and the roasty ris character comes through more strongly . there is a small amount of alcohol bite as well . mouthfeel is on the lighter side of what i would usually like , but there is a nice creamyness . overall , not the hugest fan of this one . it 's good , but i would definitely expect more .

0.40 0.40 0.90 0.40 0.90	sorry for the low score , but this is not a mild . this is definately a pale ale or an ipa or something in that family . it is an excellent well made beer but not a mild . the pour is bright copper color with a full white head and lace on the glass , nice . ahint of malt introduces the flavor before the hop assault starts . the beer is crisp and very dry and dries out even more in the finish . a nice pale ale

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.70	bright yellow and unfiltered with a full white head that leaves nice lace . perfumey `` misty '' saaz-ish hop aroma . lean malt background overpowered by very hoppy flavor/bitterness . light-medium bodied with a very crisp dry finish . a bit too bitter in finishing .

0.40 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.70	appearance : amber colored . slightly hazy . slight head smell : smells of malts . no hop aroma taste : pretty tame but well balanced . slightly sour . mouthfeel : puckering dry from the sourness . light bodied . med carb drinkability : i could put back a few of these .

0.70 0.40 0.20 0.20 0.30	i received a 12 ounce capped long-neck bottle from a co-worker in exchange for similarly sized bottle of imperial stout . i bit on the exchange based on my co-workers assertion that he and his new female friend really `` enjoyed '' this brew and he was interested in my impression . a : it was copper colored with an orange tint to the body . the one finger head was off white and receded to a ring around the collar and a partial cover of the surface of the brew . the ring was sustained for some time by an aggressive carbonation and the ring produced a jagged lacing that was more entertaining than the taste of this beer . s : the aroma was not what i expected . there was the expected pumpkin odor that included nutmeg and cinnamon . however , there an even more dominant and distracting odor that was reminiscent of a diluted cleaning solution . t : the spice and pumpkin flavors were a recessive component of the flavor . more dominant was the pungent , sour taste of lime scented pinesol . m : thin body with a tangy spicy early sensation followed by a chemical and sour aftertaste . d : my first and last . i 'm biased against dominantly fruity and vegetable flavored beer , however , under the right conditions they have their place . my co-worker has stumbled on one of those 'right conditions ' i hope someday to join him in a similar state of bliss . comment : after weighing the virtues of being honest versus blowing some smoke to maintain peace in the work place i decided my co-worker deserved the truth . just as love ( and/or a half-rack of macro lager ) can cloud ones vision , i believe his taste buds were tainted by a layer of lust that gave this brew a boost in his esteem proportionate to the boost in his libido generated by his association with his new `` friend . '' i hope beer helps keep them together but i pray their relationship , as well as their taste buds , mature .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	pours a cloudy yellow with amazing white head that stays through out the whole glass . the smell is very strong of lots of herbs . the taste is a little one sided here leaning towards the spices used . i tend to like my wits with a little more orange and malt backbone to balance . over all a good beer but not the best in the style . it is possibly the best looking wit i have ever had though .

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.70	16.9 oz. , 500 ml , english bottle , a : pours a bright orange without much of a head , kind of pallid . s : nice smell of english malt and hops , some butterscotch/diacetyl , sulfur , and fruit . t : this is a pretty good tasting beer . good flavours of caramel and pale malt , with a dry , earthy , almost woody flavour from the hops . there is also a twinge of acidity , reminiscent of lemon or orange juice . m : dry , hard , somewhat metallic , but not overly so , medium-bodied , quite refreshing as well . d : a good little epa from wychwood , i could see myself drinking a few pints of this , good stuff .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.90	bottle from flexabull that arrived at my door less than three hours ago - i just could n't wait to crack this one open . poured the whole thing into a 22 oz . terrapin snifter . appearance : beer pours a gorgeous crystal-clear ruddy amber beer with a marvelous one-and-a-half finger meringue-like head with fantastic retention . carbonation is sparse but fine-bubbled and concentrated . lacing is also pretty unbelievable on this one , falling into avant garde-esque sheets and splotches . very nice looking beer . aroma : mainly spicy floral notes and some sweet , zesty citrus , but all in all , a little disappointing . it 's way too faint and not nearly hoppy enough ; at least , hoppy enough for a wet-hopped harvest ale . taste : interesting . a mellow bitterness throughout , and tons of hop flavors - you can identify pretty much every hop note you 'd want to in here . that 's not say it 's intensely , pungently hoppy , however ; it does n't blow you away with sheer intensity as much as it impresses you with an understated delicate complexity . there 's light , spicy pine , herbal leafyness , lots of light , higher floral notes , and faint bitter grapefruit . the malt profile is pleasant without being outstanding - it 's very lightly toasted , biscuity , very english . as several other reviews have mentioned , there 's a steely , mineral like presence , likely a result of the water or the grain used . it 's not unpleasant or distracting , however . mouthfeel : oily but crisp , with a nice thick , full-bodied presence , medium-to-big bubbles , a nice prickly but smooth and even level of carbonation . improves as it warms , evens out . drinkability : all-in-all , a very good beer , and for a first time attempt with local hops , a very impressive attempt . alcohol is also perfectly reasonable , making this beer extremely sessionable . that being said , it 's not the best wet-hopped beer i 've ever had the pleasure of parking in . though it 's truly gorgeous , pretty damn tasty , and feels very nice , it could use a little shoring up in the nose ( though it 's possible it lost something in transport ! ) . definitely worth a try if you can get your hands on it , and i have high hopes for its future as they expand their hop fields and tweak the recipe - the southern hemisphere and regular ol ' harvest show that sierra nevada really knows their hops !

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	355ml brown bottle , label as shown , neck with golden foil . almost pitch black in colour with big , creamy beige head . great retention and generous lacing . lovely looking porter . sweetish , smooth aroma of chocolate and coffee , with a hint of vanilla . medium-to-low carbonation , creamy mouth feel . medium-bodied porter , not as thick as some . dark chocolate and coffee notes persist flavour-wise , fairly dry and bitter for the style - though the chocolate gets stronger as the brew warms up a bit . some fruit , like raisins and black cherries , are present , too . dry , hoppy finish . lingering coffeeish after taste . a most agreeable porter from samuel smith . not as thickly `` winterish '' as some , this comes across as more refreshing and sessionable . very smooth drink , beautifully balanced , not overpowering . lovely .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a fairly clear dark straw with just a wisp of white head . smells of bubblegum with hints of banana and clove . heavy pink bubblegum flavor up front . rounds into a little bit of spiciness and clove in the finish . fairly light with good carbonation . i 'm a fan of bubblegum/banana flavors that are light on the clove so this hefe is balanced well for me . still not terribly great flavors . good , but not outstanding . [ edit ] after posting this , realized reviews are n't great so want to add that ironically this is the first terrapin beer that i 've thought was better than i expected . usually find their brews underwhelming .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	i do n't know what i ca n't believe more : that this is still brewed or that my father just bought a 24 ? so i had two of these over the thanksgiving weekend . first one in the bottle , second i poured into the glass . crystal for it 's name for sure . it 's crystal clear straw gold with a nicely carbonated white head . it 's a very attractive beer , but that 's as far as the complements go . had a metallic smell which transferred into the taste . a bit of corn on the nose as well . slight citrus in the mouth from the hops . no bitterness whatsoever . body thin , watery , but would be thirst quenching if it was n't for the flavour . after five minutes of warming the beer was hard to drink . after ten minutes i could n't take it any longer . overall if you want to chug something that 's light and quenching , this works , but for sitting around a campfire taking your time , skip this at all costs .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	beer : the abyss , 2010 reserve brewer : deschutes brewery company : bend , oregon style : american double / imperial stout abv : 11.00 % beer advocate : jay avery rating : a recommend by my buddy @ craig reyna , i was a bit apprehensive about trying this one because i 'm a quad guy and not a fan of stouts . the nitro infused carbonation really puts me off and if i were to have a stout , i already have my go-to , north coast 's old rasputin . i do , however ; have a deschutes favorite and that 's the black butte porter.i 've also been to bend , oregon twice in the last two years and now i 'm kicking myself in the ass for not going to the deschutes brewery ! anyway , after i got this recommend from craig i started doing some research and this happens to be a once a year brew , a seasonal winter brew as they call it in the beer world . i called all over the place and of course the response was ' ya , that came and went. ' anyway , on my 7th call , the liquor store owner admitted that he 'd set a an entire case aside for his own consumption and after a ton of haggling i convinced him to sell me 4 bottles . this stuff must have adonis d.n.a in it since he charged me $ 16 bucks a bottle , ***winning ! *** here is my review ... presentation : a 22 oz wax-dipped bomber that was meant for aging so instead of a freshness date , it 's labeled ; rather , with a `` best after '' date of 11/15/2011 . i guess it 's a little early to be drinking this stuff but considering the amount of work it took to get my hands on this bottle , i 'm not waiting until november to crack it open . so after about 10 minutes of cutting , peeling and cracking the wax dipped cover off , i 'm finally able to break the seal and finally pour this highly anticipated brew into an oversized wine glass . it poured like the exxon valdez with a double espresso hazelnut head and generous but thin lacing . underneath the cap read the words , `` bravely done '' . now if that is n't a rock star quote from mars i do n't know what is ... appearance : it pours like an elixir or more accurately , like a 10w 30 motor-oil . i 'm not talking synthetic but i 'm talking about a serious bonafide thick and viscous friction free engine saver . thicker than oyster sauce and an oily pitch black . i mean you can shine a high power surefire flashlight directly in front of this stuff and you 're not getting a spec of light through it . smell : an insane full roast coffee , smoky and woody with hints of chocolate dipped graham cracker . only fools and trolls would n't want to take a sip of this amazing and aromatic cloud of chocolaty heaven ! mouthfeel : velvety and thick . did i say thick ? what does that even mean ? ! i compare it to drinking a liquefied semi-sweet neslte chocolate chip infused red velvet cake without the frosting . oh she 's thick ! if you 're in the mood for a light beer then you need to turn around , take your ball and go home ! this is one of the heartiest beers i 've ever had the pleasure of drinking , a pint of this and you 're full , literally . ** winning ! ** drinkability : the true definition of a sipper . this one must be laced with the infamous tiger 's blood . it stands out to me as a special occasion type beer , something you 'd want to share with another like-minded beer lover who can appreciate it 's uniqueness . it 's funny though cause it has an easier drinkability than my usual go-to stout , mister old rasputin , which was a welcome surprise . it 's like a win inside of every moment ! taste : better than the smell , you almost ca n't process it with the normal brain ... boy am i impressed ! it starts off oaky and woody since it was 33 % aged in french oak and bourbon barrels . that being said , it 's only a 3rd aged in those barrels so the oak was n't too corky and there was a touch of bourbon that shined through just enough to tell you that it was different from the rest . i also get a dark truffle baker 's chocolate roasted malt finish . it 's like walking into a starbucks and ordering off of their secret menu and sipping a chocolate full roast coffee blend with a nutty alcoholic backbone and a cocoa finish . you 're sitting in the coffee shop sipping on a secret brew and only you know about it and only you can appreciate its bitter black licorice personality as it envelopes itself into an almost charlie sheen like rebelliousness ! ! i really ca n't fathom how awesome this brew is going to be after i finish aging it . i do n't expect you to either . i opened this one up prematurely because i 'm impatient and need immediate gratification but i am already truly amazed by the absolute posterboy for a warlock stout that presented itself here ... i ca n't wait to grab the next one out of my cellar in 8-10 months when this beer hits its sweet spot ! i just took my final sip while finishing up this 22 oz bomber by myself and look at me , i 'm drunk.. , duh ! cause that 's how i roll , i only have one speed , i have one gear.. `` go ! ! ``

0.40 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.80	pours with a two-fingered white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace but pour slowly there is a ton of chunky bits and with the active carbonation it *looks* like a witch 's cauldron . cloudy amber color . nose is sweet maybe bready . starts sweet and crisp , finishes smooth but there is some alcohol in the background .

0.40 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.60	blue moon grand cru , brewed to coincide with new years and a full moon . poured from an attractive 25 ounce bottle into a pint glass . appears straw/gold in color with a ton of floating chunks of yeast which affect its appearance . aroma quite light just some wheat/yeast elements . flavor primarily wheat , with a citrus notion . lemon peel , orange , and belgian style wit flavors with just a hint of spice . biscuity malt also chimes in . mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a smooth finish . drinkability rates high for a strong beer , it is perilously easy to embibe . a worth while beer from coors ? just needs cleaned up a bit .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	poured from a bottle into a pint glass . a black as night , and pours with the appearance of used motor oil . an outstanding thick , three finger , brown head that lasted a very long time . patchy lacing . s a medium strength aroma of roasted malts , chocolate , espresso , and vanilla . t taste definitely matches the smell here , with coffee , vanilla , and milk chocolate being the predominant flavors . intense in its flavor presentation . some alcohol warming in the finish , but overall the 10 % abv is remarkably well hidden . very sweet upfront , but just when it would have a tendency to become cloying , a little bittering hops kick in bringing balance , and leaving an aftertaste closer to dark/bittersweet chocolate . maybe lacking complexity , but it sure delivers whats advertised with gusto . m thick and creamy , like a chocolate malt . carbonation is extremely minimal and suits the flavors well , lending to a very heavy feel in the mouth . sort of coats and hangs there . just a tiny bit syrupy . clearly a sipper . o i found this brew to be delicious , although with such strong coffee/roast flavors is closer to a stout than a porter . in fact , this rivals many a coffee stout that i have sampled ! as much as i enjoyed it , i could not have more than one of these in an evening . took me the better part of an hour to finish it , and had me not even wanting another beer afterwards , it 's flavors were that strong . would be a fantastic dessert beer . would be interested to try the barrel aged/oaked versions to see if they bring a little more depth and complexity .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.50	ugly dirty brown . oak , sour grape , unripe apple . raisin , cherry , too sweet . syrupy sweetness gets in the way of body , taste and complexity . flavors are n't particulary outstanding either . below average flanders red for me . should have been less sweet , the sweetness should have been tastier and a tad more sour would n't hurt .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.80	pours golden-orange with brilliant clarity . one and a half finger head is dense , off-white in color and shows lacking retention producing almost no lacing . clean nose , mabye some faint toasted pale malt ( possibly a distant chlorine scent ? ) . cara-pils and lightly toasted pale malt sweetness is gradually met by a timid fruitiness and soft husky flavor . semi-dry aftertaste , some nutty tones , but fairly bland with just a blank hop balancing hop bitterness . light bodied with medium carbonation ; a very middle of the road mouthfeel that allows the fruity yeast characters typical of this brewery to shine through . finishes with some mild residual dextrins but still highly drinkable . certainly not offensive , but not something i will seek out in the future .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	soft white to off white head begins at two and three quarters inches falling to one quarter of an inch within five minutes leaving no lace on the glass . hazy dirty gold in color . large quantity of sediment entered glass despite careful pouring efforts . aroma was weak almost sterile smelling with a faint hop background that was very hard to detect and possibly a simple figment of the imagination . medium body with slow developing flavors . a clean , sterile tasting start fades into what seems somewhat like sour cherries . possibly a result of yeast sediment making it into the glass . finish is dry and hoppy .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	( review from a 330ml bottle . drank in a duvel tulip ) duvel has been a `` go to '' beer for me for some years . i consider duvel to be a loyal ally . a damn good piece of belgian brewing construction . duvel is an excellent `` gateway '' beer for people starting out in good beer . it resembles a pils in appereance , so novice beer drinkers are at ease with it . when presented in its legendry tulip , how could you say no ? . it looks fantastic . big foamy top , above glowing yellow base . the aroma is estery , with banana , apple and pear . citrusy noble hops , with some pepper corn vibez . drinking this is damn refreshing and dangerously fun . very dry , fruity ( esters mentioned in the aroma ) ..peppery , spicy hops are alcoholic and cloying to your mind . light backbone sweetness . duvel is flavoursome , refreshing and dangerously easy to drink . a classic .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a rich golden orange , excellent clarity , good carbonation , topped by a level one finger slab of snow white foam . sweet aroma is fruity , candyish and boozy . first taste coats the tongue with a thick sweet base . the rye cuts through enough to make a statement without taking control . the rye and hops manage to reel in the sweetness , without ever dominating themselves . no alcohol burn , but a definite belly warming that lingers on and seems to increase when you except it to subside . it does though , and it is not a case of a beer being too hot . thick mouthfeel slides nice on a cold winter night . drinkability is enjoyable , but a bomber at a time is plenty . wo n't replace blithering idiot , but an enjoyable alternative barleywine from the good folks at weyerbacher . here 's to year thirteen .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured into snifter on 12/9/09 10/6/09 etched the bottle a - dense & hazy copper ; amber highlights . semi-aggressive pour yielded hardly any head . swirling is required to garner any semblance of retention . minimal lacing ; what 's there is sporadic . s - caramel & toasted bread accentuated with modest hop aromas . hints of pine with some faint traces of citrus - namely tangerine & grapefruit . hops become more apparent as it warms but never truly push to the front . t - earthy & piney bitterness upfront . wisps of floral & citrus hops follow but are very faint . solid toasted malt backdrop . caramel is there , too but not as prominent as in the nose . m - medium body with reasonably prickly carbonation . has a nice bite to it . there 's a little bit of resin in there . some lingering bitterness that tapers off quickly . d - drinkability is quite good . easily sessionable , in my opinion . quoth the bottle : `` perfect for any occasion . '' indeed .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	12 oz . bottle into a pint glass/ no freshness date p : coca-cola brown with 3 fingers of tan foam that forms a pretty nice crown on top . the foam is thick and creamy , dense and firm , and shows good retention before it dissipates to form a thin skin on the surface . this looks pretty good . a : unfortunately , the nose lowers my expectations considerably . lightly roasted malts , fudge , and coffee are there , but the aroma is pitifully weak . even more concerning is that same weird sourness/funkiness that i first smelled in bayhawk ales chocolate porter ( see review ) that is not at all pleasant . t : well thankfully , it 's nowhere near as bad as bayhawk ales ' porter , but it ai n't very good either . the fudge chocolate is there along with coffee , vanilla , and a slight hops presence , but it 's so woefully under-malted that the roasted/burnt charcoal-like malts that are there seem really thin and flimsy . lots of mineral notes underneath with a bit of a spicy hop kick on the finish . just like the nose promised , the flavors are really weak , uninteresting , and very underwhelming . but at least the sour/funkiness is muted more than it was in the aroma . not very good . m : eel river organic porter is medium-bodied , but with a smooth , kind of watery thin feel along with a moderate amount of carbonation . furthermore , it has no creamy underbelly or even a slight amount of chewiness to speak of . exactly the opposite of how i like my porters ! notes : well seeing as how this is my first brew from eel river , i have no idea if this was a bad bottle , off batch , or if the brewery just simply makes beers that are n't to my liking . whatever the case is , this beer sitting before me is a sad excuse for an american porter . now i 'm feeling a bit apprehensive about trying the rest of their line .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.60	750ml bottle into snifter . split with a friend . a : pours a dark honey amber with a touch of fizzy head that quickly vanished into nothing . no head , no lace . s : i can smell the honey and what i think are the chilies , and there is also a weird spicy-fruit syrup scent to it that i ca n't place my finger on . t : initial taste is sweet , supposedly from the honey , slightly medicinal , with hints of the chilies and maybe bubblegum . the finish brings out the coca and a touch of nutmeg . aftertaste is medicinal , peppery and spicy , and also has a faint residual burn from the chilies . after coming back to this beer after walking away for about ten minutes i 'm picking up a lot more syrupy fruit , maybe exotic fruits or strawberries . m : unimpressive mouth with frothy carbonation and a medium body . alcohol is hidden fairly well but there is a touch of viscous slickness in the finish . d : hmmmm ... i 'm not sure how to feel about this one . it 's not bad , but i 'm not sure i 'd ever need to drink it again . above average as a beer , but it 's hard for me to rate this one to style .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	bottle : poured a light pastel color beer with a big foamy head with great retention . aroma is a weird mix between some acidic blackberry and a light witbeer base . taste is a very weird mix between light blackberry with some acidic notes and a bland belgian white with a bad yeasty finish . i dont know if it is the yeast or what but i cant get around those barberie beers .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	pours pitch black and completely opaque without even the slightest hint of lighter color when held to a light source . frothy 1.5 finger chocolate coffee colored head that quickly settles into a lasting ring . roasted malty aroma with hints of bitter sweet dark chocolate , toffee , roasted coffee , oatmeal , alcohol and subtle hops . slightly toasty with some subtle dark fruit notes . pretty carbonated up front with a chewy viscous mouthfeel . very roasty with lots of silky chocolate malts , roasted coffee bean , oatmeal , licorice , toffee and alcohol . a bit too hoppy for my preference with a very strong alcohol warmth . this beer is kind of all over the place and the high abv is not very well masked . decent but not what i was expecting .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.50 0.40	so in my review of trafalgar 's smoked stout i said i would n't buy any more beer from the brewery . the ocb summer sampler just went on sale so i bought it for the other beers and i 'm pretending this one was free . so my expectations are low going in . pours a bright yellow colour with thick head . lots of lacing . i 'm feeling hopeful about this . not much for smell or taste though . a hint if grassy hops , with a mild off flavour . pretty bland . carbonation is good at least .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.70 1.00	urthel hibernus the beer of champions . happy new years as well . damn the head on this beer is massive . it 's definitely snowing in texas . the head resembles a mountain top with layers of bubbling carbonation . amazing body color , rich and golden , yet leans towards the orange . opps , i just stuck my nose into the crazy foamy retention . it kind of felt nice ! this tripel puts out tons of fruity esters . it 's just a rush of fragrant untamed spicy fruit notes . apples , pears , and light citrus rind . a small bit of hops lay behind the citrus . very complex smell overall , and right on for the style . spicy and tangy on the palate . provides a well balanced dryness . candied malt sweetness with a spicy lingering hop note . this tripel would be well suited to people new to the style . as it 's not overly complex in the taste department . however , it remains true to the style and still offers an excellent beer . a solid tripel , and one that is incredibly easy to drink . dangerously so if i may add .

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	this beer pours opaque and colorless . two fingers of dense , cafe latte colored head rises up , and falls to a top coating that leaves a wall of lacing . i smell raw bacon , cottage ham , dark coco , and not much else ! not very complex , but lovely . i taste ham , bacon , chicory blended coffee , with faint hints of coco . creamy with a medium body . it is slightly bitter . not something that id want to drink a lot of , but wow what a beer . would go well with bacon and eggs , or bbq .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a dark hazy muddy brown color with zero head . attempts to swirl and induce any head is futile ; very minimal spotty lacing . aromas begin with dark dark fruits , leather , oak and light light bourbon . as it warms more you get apple skin and vinous grape notes . some sherry/light oxidated notes are also present . really complex to say the least . the tastes begin quite tart surprisingly . dark dark fruits , booze soaked dark toasted bread , sour cherry and vinous dry soaked oak . as i further sample i get more complex flavors of leather , brett barnyard funk/mustiness and some pitted stone fruits . once again really complex and different than anything i have ever had . mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with zero carbonation , which i usually hate but i do n't mind it here . finish is super dry and oaky which is expected for 4 years of barrel aging . overall i am really pleased with this beer . as others have stated , you will either love it or hate it . i 'm on the side that is a big fan . hopefully over the next year or so the bottle conditioning will up the carbonation a tad to add to the only downside this beer currently has . i imagine this is how many beers used to be back in ancient brewing times with lots of oak character and slight brett flavors . complex and recommended in my opinion ; maybe not worth the original elevated price tag but still tasty and worth a go if you do n't have to give up a king 's ransom for it .

0.30 0.50 0.60 0.40 0.60	devoid of any kind of real head . clear golden color and smell like im about to drink a glass of tang ... hmmm beer in space ! dry , watery mouth and thin body . slight bitterness from the hops . is noticeable and malt or barley is nowhere to be found . pretty much orange flavoring is all i taste , not that its overpowering but that 's all its really offering . i was hoping for a lot more instead i got kool-aid .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.30 0.50	the 2010 version was hop strong , but 2011 was wrong from the outset . this beer was a lovely golden/orange with off white head in a glass . the nose was hop dominated ... go figure . copper notes and bitter hops were all of the nose . the taste was similar to a yard full of wild onion cut on a 94 degree and blown into your face . this was gross and drain poured . the mouthfeel was average for the style , if you can get past the onion . overall , i love founders . period . however , this year 's batch of devil dancer is not what it should have been . i think that it is a mistake ( maybe ? ) . i read other reviews of an a+ beer , but i am shocked . however , i suggest that you drink everything else they make !

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.60 1.00	if i was n't completely shameless , i 'd choose something other than tequiza as the target for my first beer advocate review . that said , i 'm a shameless whore so let the reviewing commence ... . i was first turned on to this beer by a girl i was dating who had excellent breasts but a suspicious palate . safe in the knowledge that her virtues far outweighed her faults , i drank this beer willingly , even eagerly . the color is an awful yellow . the beer smells strongly of lime which i liked very much . the taste is very light and overall it 's extremely drinkable as long as you forget that it 's supposed to be a beer . excellent thirst quencher on a hot day ; great with mexican food and mexican women .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.90	very crisp and fresh with a lightness and drinkability . great beer on a hot day , maybe after some yard work . very smooth with a slight mild honey comb finish . i find this beer dangerous cause i feel like i could drink quite a few in one sitting with ease .

1.00 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.40	pours a light amber with an enormous head . just huge . you want to pour this one slowly or it 'll be nothing but head . it recede quickly either . it sticks around in big pillowy globs and makes interesting shapes . the aroma is wonderful . i swear i smell pineapple upside down cake ! there 's also a ton of hop smells . notes of pine , citrus rind , and peppery spice . taste does n't quite live up to the great smells however . this beer could benefit from a little more sweetness to balance out the attack of hop acids on the tongue . do n't get me wrong i do love my ibus but this one gets hot with the alchohol as well . mouthfeel is bitter and full bodied . drinkability is pretty low . the abv is huge and the beverage dominates your taste buds and can not really be enjoyed with many foods . i 'd go with something spicy like thai or mexican if you 're pairing this one .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	appearance : not the best looking beer out there , 1 finger of head that dissapates rather quickly , yellowish color almost reminds me of a miller lite . smell : not much to brag about here either , grainy and a hint of corn . taste : much better than the look and smell , sticks with the grain theme but has more flavor than the scent would lead one to believe . mouthfeel : this beer does the job on mouthfeel , crisp and refreshing with a good level of carbonation and no bad aftertaste ... could drink several of these in a row on a warm day , or any day for that matter . overall : dont be fooled by the stubby bottle , give this one a try especially for the price . can be found for close to a buck-a-beer and beats many beers for the same price hands down .

0.90 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.50	this beer looks like the platonic ideal of beers . light amber/orange color and a fluffy white head that dissipates slowly . unfortunately , the taste doesnt quite live up to the appearance . theres a distinctly sweet taste up front and no finish at all . the aroma is a bit floral , but weak . overall , its a passable session beer if its all you can find , but nothing id ever actively hunt down .

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60	this beer is not retired ; it is imported by shelton brothers . slightly hazy , white gold in hue with a kiss of orange . white head , at the apex the foam was a half finger tall . head retention was excellent ; the bubbles were slow to fade to a tight cap that lasted the entire consumption . subsequent lacing was spotty and not really noteworthy . still , on the whole , this is a great looking beer ! soft nose ; grainy with some hints of fruit and honey . lemon , oranges , apricots , and bananas ... it smells sweet . beyond the fruitiness and vague maltiness this bouquet is n't saying much . i find it too muted to be a good triple , too quite , too restrained . i find it boring but others might dig it more than i. i was hoping for more and i surely expect more . again , soft palate ... but it is tasty . warming sweetness with some honey , vanilla , vague fruitiness ( lemon zest , oranges ) before hops arrive . light bitterness , enough to balance the grainy-sweet malt . compared to other triples and compared to my personal `` guideline '' i think de graal falls short . i 'd like more bitterness , a more pronounced malt backbone and generally cleaner and crisper . medium-light in body , moderately-low carbonation ... the mouthfeel is a bit thin for me . way too easy to drink ... i finished my 750ml too quick . this is not a compliment . i should what/need to sip on a triple . i should enjoy every ounce . i should find depth and complexity . i was left wanting . forgettable . even though it is inexpensive compared to other belgian triples i would rather pay a dollar or two more and get a world class beer . purchased in omaha .

1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90	poured almost pitch black , good size tan foamy head that diminished to a tan creamy collar that held the sides of the glass all the way down . smell : was of toffee . taste is exceptional , roasted coffee with chocolate notes , and just the right amount of hops . mouthfeel was a bit chewy , but very carbonated and light . drinkability is great with this one . a very good beer that i will have again !

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	saison dupont `` vielle provision '' says the bottle , and the cork proclaims `` 2009 '' edition . appearance : light yellow in color with a large soapy head that stays around the whole time . the head on this beer is remarkable and deserves recognition . a slew of little bubbles rising through the beer . at first the beer was fairly clear but later i swirled some yeast in and the beer became cloudy . smell : yeasty aroma with some hay/barnyard elements . taste : once again , quite yeasty and minerally . a flash of sweetness , followed by a noble hop bitterness , imparted by saaz/tettnang hops though i am not sure which is used . the finish is very clean and the balance of this beer is well done . funky fresh ... mouthfeel : medium bodied with a smooth finish , clean with some dusty yeast lingering . drinkability : a pleasant saison that is definately foreign to my taste buds . pretty much spot on for the style . if i had more of this beer , i 'd be happier .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80	12 oz bottle poured into a pokal . a = no real head , but good color and clarity . s = good light , maple notes in the nose , overall fresh and clean smells . t = fresh taste with some sharp cheddar notes at front of tongue , maple syrupy in the middle and some lemon towards the back of the mouth . m = mouthfeel is too carbonated and stinging on the tongue . d = good drinkability . can easily drink this and feel like another would be in order .

0.40 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.60	bottle courtesy of gregg , thanks ! 2010 bottle is a bit of a gusher , luckily the darkness snifter was ready and i didnt lose too much . hopefully this one isnt infected . color is a nasty looking cloudy brown with lots of sediment floating around and a 3 finger thick light tan head that lingers . smell is a good balance of sugary malt and alcohol , some simcoe hop bitterness , slightly metallic astringent quality , the amarillo is totally overpowered . taste is very sweet up front , lots of sweet cherries and dark fruits , caramel malt , some fruity hops , slightly piney , some alcohol . mouthfeel is a bit light for a barleywine with a medium carbonation - way off for the style , the alcohol seems to have thinned it out . warm alcohol finish . not a very drinkable barleywine , this one definitley needs a little time on the shelf .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured into an oversize goblet at 40 degrees . appearance : a half one finger head that is ivory and is creamy . the head has poor retention . the color of the beer is a dark brown with copper red hues . the clarity of the beer is hazy to opaque . there is some carbonation bubbles in the beer . nose : a mild malt build , with a subtle sweetness . there are notes of bananas , phenols , solvent , caramel , dried cherries , and toffee . taste : the malt lacks depth and character like a good dubbel . there are notes of caramel , toffee , dried cherries , raisins , bananas , phenols , and some malty sweetness . the mouth feel of the beer is carbonated , dry , astringent , and edgy . overall : the body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium also . this dubbel is just okay there is no character , no complex malts , or rich flavors . i am disappointed in gi . i am glad that i had the opportunity to try another gi , beer . thank you .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.70	beer appears dark brown , with only a color change to the lighter at the last .5 cm . smells much like a porter with the malt smell very evident , slight chocolate aroma evident . taste is like a scotch ale-lite . has all the porter qualities but is not nearly as feeling . is an interesting beer , but i would much rather have a bar made black & tan .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	apologies in advance to troegs for this 6er , just purchased , was bottled 10/25/10 . i feel like there 's no one to blame here , except maybe that people are n't drinking this fast enough . so it 's all of our fault . a fine looking pale . hay-colored , a minimal head with a purchase of lace , very clear . i can see the buildings a block over magnified spectacularly through the glass . aroma at this point is mostly pale malt , a little sweet , some faded pine and earthy hop . flavor is mostly the same with a decently firm , yet comforting , bitterness . it 's okay , probably better fresh . maybe some other time , we shall meet again , and this review will be altered..in the future .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.40	a- pours dark black . 2 finger dark tan head . when held up to a light there is sort of a cherry wood color around the edges of the glass . one of the prettiest beers i 've seen . s- chocolaty , malty and smokey . smells like soy sauce . both dark and light fruits ( raisins and oranges maybe ? ) . a touch of alcohol scent . t- chocolate malts are the first taste i get , followed by smoke , soy sauce and fruit . finishes with alcohol and a tiny bit of hops . flavors are not balanced , they conflict . to quote the guy at the beer store where i bought it `` it tastes like someone poured about 1/3 of a bottle of sunset wheat into a decent imperial stout . '' m- pretty good . maybe a bit thin and too carbonated for me but i basically like drinking motor oil mixed with cement . d- i 've had beers higher than 9.5 % abv that were more drinkable . alcohol flavor is too pronounced and there is too much carbonation . also if i want soy sauce i 'll drink a bottle of soy sauce , not a beer .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.60	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a pilsner glass . a : ugh . thin , sickly yellow with minimal head . no lacing . s : citrus , grain , and light herbs . not bad at all ! t : light , smooth , and grainy . unlike most flying dog beers , the wateriness of tire bite actually works in its favour . it is a light flavour with heavyhanded grain and the mildest citrus notes . almost like an upscale version of the most popular american light lagers . m : carbonation is pleasant , but there is a harshness that fades without providing much aftertaste . d : i could definitely see this beer serving as fodder for beer pong or similar games . goes down easy , but not much for flavour or aftertaste or much else , really . serve this to your undiscerning guests and they 'll think it 's quite nice ; connoisseurs stay away .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.50	12oz bottle into a orval glass . finally got to try this , after the great reviews i was really excited . sadly , this is another short 's beer that is a huge let down ... a medium copper pour with tons of head . light tope head , soapy bubbly , small and compact . great retention , nice lava stack on the top ... aroma is super disappointing , light with only a whisp of sweetness coming through . strawberries are there but so is the typical staleness that you would expect . a hint of graham cracker on the back which is nice ... the taste gives you a quick burst of strawberry to start but then its gone and replaced again by staleness . strawberries can not be replicated in a beer , stop trying . this sounds so much better than it is , do n't bother .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	i will say right up front , that i think this product was mis-labeled . it has a very slight beer taste , but to me it seems more like a malt-ernative . somehow , i still seem to like it . who needs to jam a lime into an overrated mexican beer , when you can now get the same refreshment from milwaukee . great beach brew , or maybe to compliment taco night .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	this pilsner pours pale straw in color , with a floral herbal nose . unfortunately , the thin , white head falls quickly even though it retains a bit of lacing . ( a good pils , as a german brewmaster friend of mine once told me , should take seven minutes to pour -- allowing the head to dissipate . `` any less than that , send it back , '' he claimed . ) regardless , bavik has a balanced mouthfeel , with plenty of sweetness to compliment the crisp , herbal finish . while i have to consider that this style -- or any lighter lager -- will take a beating as an import , this is a good effort ... albeit nothing more than what was to be expected

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	crystal clear amber to light brown beer with two full fingers worth of light tan head . very musty on the nose along with some belgian spiciness , possibly some wet leaves . faintly lemon and floral as well . bready grain sweetness along with some lightly toasted notes . caramel upfront with tingling bitterness that lingers . lemony citrus and straw along with some spicy quality . no harshness and a very clean ( not muddled ) taste , where each flavor can be picked apart fairly easily . hop flavor is fairly one noted . tongue drying along with being medium bodied having low to medium carbonation . slightly weighty on the tongue . bright flavor and bittersweet aftertaste compels the imbiber to continue ...

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	hmm ... it appears that i do not have logged my original review for the bastard , so i guess there 's nothing to directly compare against . alas : amber with tan creeping-vine lace . settling quickly to wee carbonation with large , interspersed bubbles . after a year or so this beer still reeks with malty-booze but the hop presence is clearly less at the forefront . the leafy , herbal qualities of the hops have quelled down to a harsh , weirdly scotch-like presence amongst the notably high prescence of alcohol . the citrus , grapefruit qualities are gone too , replaced not with any real rounded qualities except for a slight butteriness that was not there before . this now seems kind of like a smaller , hoppier , strong ale . slight metallic flavors abound , with no to little sweetness makes it lose points . any bready or doughiness is burned off by that almost stale hop-kick . still , pretty smooth on the palate . each sip gives you a nice little warm buzz in the stomach , and i could imagine how this on-tap would get really addictive . i 'll stick with it fresh though , thanks .

0.20 0.80 0.30 0.20 0.30	light light yellow with white white head of bursting big bubbles without retention or stickyness . lokks a little like pale ginger ale . smell is great - some corn-like sweetness with a very pleasing level of diacetyl , some leafy saaz and a hint of toasted grains . taste begins like water with grain flavoring but then the sweetness and butteriness quickly disappear leaving an astringent metallic sting . medium harsh carbonation , sort of soda-like high frustose corn syrup feel . although i find the aroma to be quite pleasing , the taste ruins it . not an enjoyable beer for me .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.90	pours a light , burnt orange , very clear . the beautiful amber-orange gives it an amazing radiant quality , looks delicious and refreshing . the beer is topped off by a stark white , frothy head that leaves a consistent sticky lacing . there is a hint of grain and malt in the nose with citrus and a resin-like hop aromas . notes of grapefruit , some bread and herbal , green pine . subtle sweet malt up front on the palate which immediately rolls back into a citrus grapefruit followed by a bitter and lingering pine finish . it is a very clean , crisp and refreshing beer . more balanced than i remember it was when i got it on draft at the avenue . the bitterness is not overwhelming but might be for some , so do n't make this your first ipa . my opinion is that this beer is best enjoyed on a hot afternoon for that much anticipated first beer of the evening . also great for the beach , on a deck or patio watching the sun set to match the color of this gorgeous beer , especially since it will go great with chips and salsa .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	this is one attractive looking beer . clear amber color with little carbonation . head is thin , lightly tanned and foamy with good retention and lacing . aroma is pretty light and mostly malty sweet . not much to really keep you interested . good flavor with about the right balance of sweet and bitter . the hop flavor could use a boost to help finish it off but very clean over all . no problem at all finishing off a bottle or two of this .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.70	aroma is strongly hoppy with an undertone of grapefruit and just a suggestion of sweetness . it pours a dark , coppery amber with a frothy , persistent , off-white head . bubbles cling to the side of the glass , and lacing is fairly substantial . flavor is fairly hoppy , somewhat malty and just a little bitter with a hint of sour citrus . smooth texture has just a little fizziness , and finish is hoppy and bitter with a sour undertone . this is not the best ipa i 've had , but it is worthy of a try .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.30 0.40	enjoyed in a pint glass a : pours a decent looking amber color that is slightly hazy with a medium amount of carbonation bubbles and about two fingers worth of head that is very fine and is a light tan color that lingers nicely , leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass s : very gentle on the pumpkin spice notes , kind of just has a bland scent with a bit of pumpkin to it t : bland , not much at the begining or end and only slight pumpkin taste in the middle , bland bland bland m : medium carbonation in the beginning , not bad through the middle , leaves a bit of zest feeling on the palate afterwards o : not a good pumpkin , no depth , no complexity , no taste really , just bland and not something i would buy again

0.70 0.40 0.30 0.30 0.20	i swear i have reviewed this beer before but yet it says i do n't , anyway ... i 've had this several times from the bottle , pours a light strawish yellow , actually has pretty good carbonation , but is very watery ... the aroma is skunky mostly with a little hops ... the taste is mostly skunky but has a terrible harsh bitter finish . this is one of my least favorite adjuncts because of the finish . would rather have a bmc .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 1.00	a bomber at cellar temp , handled as if it were full of nitroglycerin , opens with a threatening pop ! and a vigorous surge of large bubbles begins head-building operations immediately in the neck of the bottle . this drink wants out ! a careful pour into a tulip glass evokes a billowing , explosive cloud of soft white foam , decorated by a tiny glowing golden body alive with bubbles . the head is continually fed by a steady stream of bubbles , and holds at over two fingers throughout the drink , lacing the glass in a fashion not unlike shaving cream . this drink is alive ! smell is yeasty and sweet , with notes of clover honey , hay , crushed red pepper , and unbaked sweet rolls . tastes yeasty and tart , with sweet grass , underripe green pears , nutty and dry , with a flavor of spicy pie crust and a touch of astringency and chalk in the last pour from the bomber . lingering dryness and a note of raw pecans remind the drinker to drink again . smooth , rich , and tingly in the mouth with a nice clean finish . nutty , yeasty character lingers ; extremely drinkable and damned delicious .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	appearance : shakespeare stout pours out nearly black with a full 3 fingers of mocha colored head . retention is very good , and lacing is very abundant . smell : roasted malts , charcoal , and burned toast form the base of the smell of this beer . coffee follows , with some pretty strong hop notes on the back end . honestly , this beer just smells like burned ... .something . there 's not any sweetness to it . just a burned smell and some hops . taste : there 's more of the smell in the taste . roasted malts and burned toast with some coffee . some noteworthy hops on the back end . once again , that burned taste really hangs around on this beer . no sweetness from the oats in the beer or anything to balance it out . mouthfeel/drinkability : this beer is between medium and full bodied , and fairly smooth drinking overall . this beer has been given pretty solid reviews by many people . i just do n't find it that appealing .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.60	pours a two finger , cream head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace . nose is like an oak barrel . clear deep amber color . medium carbonation and medium bodied . flavor is malty with background hops , sour grapefruit finish . disappointing barleywine . 2006 vintage , $ 6.20 for a 22oz bottle from colonial spirits acton , ma .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	poured a midnight copper with a long lasting fluffy head . looks pretty good in a pint glass . smell is average at best ... nothing to write home about . has a caramel taste , but falls a little flat . overall nothing really jumps out about this beer . almost like you really have to search for it 's character . in the end though it 's not that bad , it basically comes off as just an average beer . to me river horse overdoes it more often than not ( hop a lot a mus for example ) , but this beer does the opposite ( it does n't do enough ) . the finish is like eating an actual caramel ... sticky and sweet . would i buy this again ? no . but would i say it 's crap ? no . it 's just an average beer .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.60 0.70	500ml bottle bought from sainsburys ... poured a light straw yellow colour . white head poured loose and frothy and faded almost instantly to patchy covering . no carbonation at all and no real lacing to speak about ... takes quite a while for all the aromas to develop in this one ... spicy citrus fruits with some tropical notes ( limes , grapefruits , apples and light peach ) , some yeasty and bready hints coming through , slight belgian tripel notes , pale malts , piney sap traces , some saltiness , light floral honey , grassy , some light oakiness.. taste is a little on the bland side ... as above but with some soapy / dishwater hints , also some wet paper , decent spicy hop bite , some metallic and salty notes , quite floral and perfumed , chalky , some very faint tobacco ... feel - sharp and dry ... light bodied ... pretty refreshing but a little boring to have me going back for more than one ... overall - a pretty average brew which i do n't think i would be going back to in a hurry ... in my opinion this is not an american amber / red ale as described here - more like an ipa..

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50 0.50	poured from a 16oz . can into a pint glass at low altitude . a : pours a light yellow with a thin stark white head and not a lot of retention . not much lacking , either . s : floral hops are the most prevalent , with some misplaced sweet syrup notes in the background . t : bready malts with some strange sweet notes and a minimum of bitterness . `` crisp '' seems like a misnomer . m : medium bodied and sweet . quite a bit of carbonation . d : not at all what i would expect out of a pilsener ...

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.90 0.90	poured into a pint . beautiful deep , dark amber with a thick white head . the head leaves quite a bit of lace down the glass . a very appealing looking brew . the smell is pretty light . bready and caramel malts with a tiny bit of citrus hops . a little bit of a sweet fart smell that is drawing me off . i 'm glad the taste does n't follow the smell . the hops both start and finish the taste . citrus and pine are right up front , caramel sweetness in the middle , and a resiny , earthy hop finish . a little too sweet , but it does n't take away from the overall taste too much . the mouth is a little thin and highly carbonated ( which is odd being that fizzy is linked to bad on the bottle . ) overall , this is a pretty badass beer , definatly a sipper , but an easy sipper at that . the price is good so i might age a few , one for 6 months and one for a year .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.60 0.80	a : pours a clear pale yellow with a small amount of white head . most of it dissipates , but a thin film does leave a bit of lacing . s : light citrus-like fruit , backed by some thin grain . t : slight sweetness , light grains , not bad though not much flavor . m : fairly light body , medium carbonation . d : drinks quite easily .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.80	this beer was just so-so . nothing to write home about on this one . it poured a more than huge head ... it kept overflowing and overflowing and overflowing . it had a white head with fine-small sized bubbles . the body was cloudy with a lot of lively carbonation and a pale yellow hue . the nose was moderately malty , hoppy and some notes of lemon . the flavor was malty , hoppy and tart with a tingly , thin and watery texture and light bodied . the lacing of this beer was very , very sparse .

0.80 0.20 0.50 0.30 0.30	well , it looks good - coppery gold with plenty of creamy head . hrm ... it 's called mallee bull , but beer should n't smell like beef ... this one had a distinct pong of beef broth in which rubber bands have been infused . needless to say , tasting was undertaken with some trepidation . flavour was not quite as bad as the aroma , but still unpleasant . aside from the meaty taste suggested by the aroma , the finish is metalic , then dies away . this gives a distinctly unpleasant watery feel . almost as if the beer is oxidized and infected . simply horrid - my first ever drain pour .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.40	sampled at ( where else ? ) the miller ale house in coral springs . might as well review it . one of those nights that $ 1 pints seemed like a good idea . appearance is wholly lacking in any kind of head - so obviously no retention or lacing . very clear , but an unattractive yellow color . smell is light , lagery . grain , sweet , and a hint of alcohol - this is an `` ice '' beer after all . taste is next to nonexistent . slight malt , no hops flavor - just a little bitterness - and a faint touch of fruit . mouthfeel is light . looked flat , but carbonation was actually fine . drinkability makes me wonder why i 'm a beer-drinker tonight - and why i 'm at this place again .

0.30 0.60 0.60 0.20 0.40	if keystone premium is awful , then how can anyone expect the light version to be any better . this beer is watery and not much else good can be said about it . others have said it better than i can . mouthfeel is weak , taste is atrocious , and poured appearance is without obvious merit . drinkability ? you got to be kidding .

0.30 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.40	i drank a ton of this while in college , but hey who , did n't . i would n't ordinarily buy busch but i saw that it has a new camo box and can , complete with hunter orange . i could n't resist this clever marketing and got a 12 pack . it was a poor choice . a- camo can with hunter orange lettering , amazing haha . the beer however is very pale . very minimal head that quickly goes away . no lacing , but that 's a given . s- corn . t- not much here either , tastes of corn and sweeteners . hefty alcohol taste on the finish . m- very thin and fizzy , almost like soda . d- if you want to drink to get drunk this is a good choice . otherwise stay away from busch , but you already knew that did n't you ?

0.20 0.60 0.20 0.40 0.20	honestly this is the closest beer has ever come to water . rolling rock `` extra pale '' has the taste and consistency of tap water . that doesnt mean it is a bad taste , but you might as well suck the faucet rather than waste money on this . my roommate wasted $ 90 on a keg of this and i ca n't help but feel like i too got f 'd in the a . this beer makes bud light look like a micro brewed masterpiece .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.60	and my journey through the sam adams variety sampler continues . 12 oz brown longneck poured into a pint glass . deep brown that looks reddish when held to the light . creamy head that retained fairly well and left very thick lace . smell was lightly roasted malts , some chocolate . not picking up on the vanilla that some others have mentioned , but my nose is a bit stuffed up . taste is fairly blah , not a lot of roasted bitterness and a bit sweet for my taste . mouthfeel is much too thin , almost watery which does not suit the style . what bitterness is there is a bit harsh because of the thin body . carbonation is medium low and pretty much right on . overall a decent beer , but not one to seek out . better to just stick with dead reckoning or anchor porter .

1.00 0.40 0.90 0.50 0.60	drank on-tap at atwood 's tavern , cambridge , ma served in a stemmed glass gorgeous appearance . deep , dark , crimson-mahogany . the translucent liquid was topped by a near two-finger head of beige colored froth . thick , lasting rings of lacing coated the glass . the aroma was surprisingly mild . in fact , i could hardly detect anything . subtle caramel malts possibly . a bit toasty . somewhat fruity and semi-sweet . a touch of alcohol hid in the background . like the nose , the flavor profile was a big letdown . malty and biscuity up front . fruity in the center . the finish was moderately hoppy and dry . the hops were somewhat earthy and herbal . there was a slight alcohol warming on the finish as well . regardless , the 9 % was remarkably well buried . the mouthfeel was super creamy and lush . medium-full bodied . pillowy and silky smooth with a slick , moderate effervescence . hairy eyeball ale was a true oddity . although the appearance and mouthfeel were exceptional , both the taste and aroma were hugely disappointing . i felt like the life had been sucked from this beer .

1.00 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	this beer looks great , clean and clear , good carbonation and head . semi sweet , straw like aroma . a good dose of hops here dominates the flavor . an easy to drink ale , but there is a harsh graininess that ca n't be ignored . mouthfeel is clean and crisp .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	bomber size samichlaus helles ! pours a dark clear gold with a 1 inch foamy light brown head that fades to nothing . no lacing on this one . smell is of rich malt , caramel , brown sugar , and dark fruits . taste is of rich malt , bread , caramel , dark fruits , and an earthy herbal hop finish . there is a definite alcohol warmth that burns the throat after each sip . this beer has a good carbonation level that has small bubbles but a thick and heavier mouthfeel . overall , this is a good but strong beer with a very nice set of smells and flavors .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	at the octoberfest in vermont . i would have only drunk this if the serving wench had n't been so stingey with her pours . what was outstanding in this beer was what they did with their hops . there was so much flavor i could n't really single out which fruit i was tasting/smelling . there was grapefruit , apple pineapple , citrus , yum ! everyone in our group agreed it was great .

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	a : pours just as the name states a golden color with 1 finger width white head and really no lacing down the glass . s : smell is fruity , also has a good deal of spiciness . you can also smell the alcohol . t : tastes of sweet fruit ( pear , apple ) . has a little apple cider hint to it . m : perfect amount of carbonation not too much not too little . d : wow , maybe i should have eaten a little something before drinking this because i fell all warm and fuzzy in the belly now ! ! great smelling and tasting tripel , good all the way around . would for sure have this again . i bet this tastes wicked good from the source on tap . thanks to nlmartin for this one , you da man ! !

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.80	i 've heard so many great things about jolly pumpkin , but this will be my first beer from them . appearance : pours into an allagash tulip a slightly hazy pale gold with a huge , fluffy , white , large-bubbled head . an insane stream of bubbles rockets up through the beer keeping the head constantly refreshed . lacing comes in sheets and chunks the entire way down the glass . smell : the smell is a potent combination of sweet pale malt , some bigger than expected herbal hops , some farmhouse funk , and some extra ber-funk . definitely a lot going on here . taste : more surprises come on the taste . despite the complex aromas , the taste is light and simple . it 's mainly a light , dry base with a farmhouse character coming out towards the finish , and a spicy , herbal hoppiness coming even later . mouthfeel : very light bodied with a slightly low carbonation . not bad though . drinkability : it goes down quite easy and is a definite thirst quencher . at 4.5 % abv , i 'd certainly order another . i was n't blown away by my first jolly pumpkin experience , but i 'd definitely like to pursue their beers further . as it stands , bam biere is a nice saison in it 's own right and is certainly worth trying .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.40	i realize that baltic porters are different but never realized that they had to be this different . appearance is very good . a nice dark red brown but not black like so many american porters . clean and transparent . smell was average at best . something there but ca n't get my `` nose '' around it . dirty socks maybe ? fresh swept garage ? dust ? musty ? something . taste is what i have a problem with . i was very unimpressed . very strong acid taste ... like vinegar . sour apples . the alcohol is very strong and cuts into the unpleasant taste . i purchased seveal bottles but could only drink a few of them . this is for sure not a drain pour but ca n't get over the strong taste . not smooth like most american porters . mouthfeel is ok . very very thin . almost burns in the mouth . happened for each bottle that i opened . drinkability ... .if you want to tie one on , this is the beer for you . very high alcohol content . however , this is n't the reason why i drink beer . a cheap macro would do this for you .

0.30 0.50 0.30 0.50 0.90	i picked up a sixer of this new brew for a 'round the firepit cookout at my house . a - yellow gold with a faint greenish cast and no real head or lace to speak of . looks like your average macro lager . s - lime rind right up front . the citrus lime lies on top of a basic mexican lager ( corona , dos equis , etc ) smell . smells very beachy and vacation-y . t - yep . lime right up in your face . this is more like a lager with a lime stuck in it than a whole new style of beer like miller chill . does n't taste half bad really . m - light bodied , a bit watery , and very thirst quenching . d - while working up a mean thirst playing around on the beach on a scorching day this would be perfect . i still like miller chill a little bit better though .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.20 0.40	slightly cloudy amber body topped by a thick lasting off white head with good lace left behind . very sour gin like aroma with aprocot and alcohol notes . sour ginlike flavor with apricot and alcohol notes . not all that great . full bodied and warming with a sodalike feel . cool bottle but the contents need work .

0.20 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50	the appearance is just like any other tasteless busch beer , the smell is horrible and the taste is like drinking beer that has gone bad for like ten years . overall this beer tastes like dirt mixed with carbonated water . it seems like it was only brewed for underage drinkers and homeless people who just want to get drunk . please avoid this beer . sam adams and fat tire is where it is at ! ! !

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.60	abita turbo dog is remarkably thick and juicy for a brown ale . if this were wine , you 'd describe it as `` extracted . '' the nose carob with mild hops , spice , and some alcohol in the background . it 's ready to explode , but stays controlled . the palette opens to immediate chocolate/carob malt balls that 's backed by a solid and relevant graininess . it has properties of great american ambers and stouts . unfortunately , these flavors hit you over the head into submission , but never really develop . such is the way with overmalted beer . the taste sheds new light on the smell and the smell then further accentuates the taste -- inordinately complex . a meal unto itself -- the turbo dog would go great with any big or greasy meal and last into dessert . creamy , sumptuous , and very full-bodied , this is the most aggressive interpretation of this style i 've ever tasted . relax , relax . ng

0.60 0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90	on cask at lazy boy saloon into an old engine oil snifter . a : practically still black body - just a tiny scattering of bubbles around the rim . only the slightest glint of orange-brown at the extremities when held up to light . no lace , but nice legs . s : beautiful , wonderful scotch : robust caramel malts , lightly peaty smoke , and strong woodiness . i 'm looking forward to this more and more . t : like the smell , this seems far more like fine scotch whisky than beer . delicately sweet malt stars things off , with profound woodiness and balanced smoke coming through as things develop . smoke on the finish . it 's amazing - the only feature of delicious scotch that does n't come through here is the booze ; this is extremely smooth throughout . i could n't have hoped for anything more . m : it even feels like an old scotch - silky medium-full body with no carbonation at all . normal i insist on at least some effervescence in a beer , but this one on cask is an exception . d : more of a sipper , but only because only small sips are needed to enjoy the intricacies of flavor . amazing beer . notes : i do n't know what more to say about this breathtakingly delicious beer . i feel so lucky to have stumbled upon the 40 on cask ( and for only $ 8 ! ) . as great as it was , though , i do n't know if i can bring myself to shell out for a bottle of this any time soon . i certainly would n't blame anyone for doing so , though . if you like scotch , you 'll love this beer . cheers !

0.40 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	nice golden straw color , thin head , clear appearance . dank hoppy attractive smell . smells like cannabis food ( weed cooked in butter ) , but let be honest cannabis and hops share the same `` order '' if you are going to get scientific with it . beautiful bitter taste , not all that well balanced , but really good taste still . not all that great feeling in my mouth , better then most , a light thin feel . a good beer for its price , i 'm ready to drink another . overall a good beer , happy that i made the purchase it . good beer for its price .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.70	12oz bottle that lacks freshness information drank out of a standard american pint glass . thanks to the people that brought this back from the brewery for me . a- this one pouts out a pretty dark brown colored body with ruby red highlights that can be seen when it is held up to a light . a rather large head of khaki colored bubbles forms on top and sticks around for a while . small rings of lacing are left behind . s- the smell on this one is pretty mild compared to what i was expecting . roasted malts up first . after that comes a decent amount of sweet milk chocolate and a lesser amount of semi sweet dark chocolate . a little bit of coffee at the end . t- the taste is equally as subdued as the nose . the roasted malts are there , but come through rather weakly . the milk chocolate that i could smell is back and gives this one a nice overall sweetness . dark chocolate and the faintest coffee finish round this one out . m- the mouthfeel is a little thin and watery for a stout . the carbonation seems on point , despite the rather large head . d- english stouts arnt the style im most familiar with , so take the above review with a grain of salt . that being said , this was a sessionable beer with more flavor than many other beers of this strength . if i had this constantly available to me , i could see myself drinking this pretty often .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.90	getting bigger bottles is always a challenge . if you enjoy what is being offered , you get your money 's worth . if you get some corn in a can , well , at least you did n't pay too much . the beer poured real nice , big fluffy head , nice maroon color , excellent carbonation , it was a real treat to see after installing a new air conditioner . smell was just your basic corny filler , but served cold , it made all the spicy stuff coming off the grill fantastic . vegetably , almost baked , like a pot pie . not really much going on , but really fresh . heavy toasted malt , with almost no hoppy yang . so refreshing , yet so empty . honesty , it 's just really good filler . enough food , & you can have one of these every other beer . there is no sense of alcohol ; light as can be . no respect that there are people who have to work tomorrow . : p

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.50	appearance this one poured a hazy orange in color and was very fluffy just like a good hefe weizen should be . the head showed some nice , clingy retention as well . smell wheres the yeast ? it says wheat , but theres no wheat . whats up with that ? this is more of a spicy peach and cherry belgian than a wheat beer . taste this had some pleasant , light pale belgian flavors but , again , no wheat . mouthfeel this one was clumsy and , worst of all , lacked the fluffy character of a good hefe weizen . drinkability not a bad ale but too off-style to enjoy .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.70	pours black with off-white/brownish head in one finger thickness that lasts for very long time , generous lacing . perfect . aroma is roasted sweetish malt , moderate fruitiness , not very complex . taste is bittery roasted , some burnt grain with very , very dry finish and sweetish light warming aftertaste . smooth medium mouthfeel . overall , drinkability was low for me , because of the flavour too intense . i am not used to it and will use this beer for training sessions .

0.30 0.40 0.50 0.40 0.40	drank from the can on the way to dubrovnik . a : can looks like some sort of cheap soda . pouring it into a small cup it 's a bright clear pale . s : kind of soury . touch of grain . not much else . t : very watery . hint of some sort of grain maybe and a light sweetness . this is almost exactly like a bud light . though a good use of my last very few bosnian markas ( with some leftover pocket change in the town of neum ) , this is not something i would look for anywhere else . best beer from region comes from bosnia

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	bottle dated best before 19 jan 2005 . i 'm a little late . pours a light copper with a soapy light tan head . poor retention and scant lacing . low carbonation consistent with an english ale . butterscotchy , toasty malt aroma with a hint of kent goldings hops nearer the end of the whiff . assertive malty and buttery diacetyl taste with a slightly hoppy , drier finish . trace vegetal notes . lighter bodied , very drinkable and carbonation level is just right . a very nice english pale ale that is a benchmark of the style . this would have to be great on cask .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	12oz bottle bottled on 02/05/09 split into 6oz sprecher sampler . a - poured with yeast . cloudy , obviously , but golden amber color with a modest white head that left a ring pretty quickly . s - a citrusy floral and sweet fruity hop aroma with a tiny malt aroma that stayed on the back-burner . t - heavy hop character with a citrus and floral bouquet with pine also and a bitter after taste . m - very quenching and light with a smooth mouthfeel ! d - it 's a rather drinkable aipa . i could do a few of these in a row .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	bottle provided by eyedrinkale ala bif20 . thanks much for the opportunity ! pours an enormous three finger fluffy head . too much carbonation from only half of the beer poured so far . cloudy and tangerine in color ... this beer looks like a wit . smells raspberry with some sweet and also a waxy that makes me think of a raspberry scented candle . tastes only mildly raspberry and a little bit yeasty . it 's wet sweet and lacks the sour/tart that often is found in raspberry beers . aftertaste has apricot , mixed berries , and orange melon . medium-light body and mildy carbonated ( must have all been released during the pour ) . a sweet and fruity drink that 's light and refreshing .

0.70 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00	a - deep dark brown , almost opaque , but clear when held to the light . thin head that does n't last . s -rich , complex earthiness , baked sugar and nuttiness that greatly resembles pecan pie , chocolate , sweet coriander . t - rich chocolate , huge nutty flavor , caramel , coriander . has slight hop bitterness and finishes dry . amazing . m - rich and full bodied , very soft carbonation . d - amazingly drinkable for the complexity . i ca n't detect any of the 8 % abv .

1.00 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90	i stopped into the harpoon visitor center at the windsor , vt site . i had the pleasure of ordering the sampler . among the five beers was this pale yellow hefeweizen . the head was incredible lasting approx.15mins maintaining at least 1/4 '' . when the head finally gave way the lace was sparse . this beer was served with a lemon wedge . i 'm not sure if i cared for that because of the overwhelming lemon scent . it had a clean crisp character and a slight toasted nut taste . there was plenty of carbonation which lent itself to a light mouthfeel . an excellent example of a light beer meant to refresh and impress .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.90	extra version of the regual re ale , with more hops , and with american hops . a huge cream color head , a beautiful deep amber color , quite dark , with bronze edges . the smell is very hoppy , very fresh . very good . a mix of american and english hop , i think . orange marmelade , grapefruit . at the taste : spectacular . a triumph of hop , clean , very dry . a superb hopping . the body is still quite light . very drinkable . herbal , hoppy aftertaste . very good beer .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	my wife grabbed me a 750ml of this for my birthday , and boy was i excited to toss this one back ! a - pours a light golden brown with a slight haze with two solid thumbs of light pillowy head with an insane amount of retention . accompanying this head which would not quit was a ridiculous amount of bubbly lacing . s - the hops were noticeable off the top , with a the classic belgian cloves and bananas on the finish . t - based on the scent i was expecting a bit more of a hop bomb , however , the hops were much more tame than the scent implied . the hops were definitely noticeable on the finish , accompanied by a bit of a metallic alcohol flavour . cloves , bananas and apple cider were the prominent flavours which would be attributed to the belgian style . m - the mouthfeel was rather surprising given the high abv , with a light a bubbly feel , not overly syropy . it did have a bit of a bite from the higher abv , but by no means was this a turn off . d - this one is quite delicious , and i would highly recommend this to any fan of belgian beers , or hop heads . the hops are tame , but perfectly balanced with the belgian flavours making for a tasty beverage . the only caveat is that you enjoy this responsibly , as the high abv can easily creep up on you !

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . a -- old gold body and a nice medium head . s -- very fresh hop aroma , pine needles and citrus . t -- very balanced at first with a hop kick at the end . m -- medium d -- get this beer as fresh as you can . a really nice in between ipa . not too hoppy not too malty . goldilocks just right .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.90	served in a pint glass , poured from a 12 oz . bottle . a - very nice golden amber with a pretty fluffy head that stayed well and left good lacing . s - candied orange and wheat . not much else . t - very citric with a good bit of sweetness . not bad , but tastes slightly artificial . another reviewer mentioned fruity pebbles ; i understand what their talking about with its almost candy-like sweetness . finishes clean , no aftertaste . m - light but not watery , with a decent bit of carbonation . d - very drinkable . goes down easy and has modest abv . easily sessionable if you like sweeter wheat beers . overall - kind of enigmatic . it 's certainly not bad , but the flavors do n't come off as very natural . my cousin loved it when he had it on draft , and he continues to like the bottled version . i 'll definitely drink it , but i probably would not buy it at all if my cousin was n't a fan of it .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	pale gold/amber . not much aroma to speak , maybe some corn . texture is watery , but also a little bit syruppy , sticky . corny , and then no other flavour to speak of . bland . hard to say too much else about it , other than it sucked bigtime , a waste of time and money ( even though it was pretty cheap ) .

0.60 0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90	had this beer a couple times now and in different vintages but this is my first review . pours a super black with no head and no lacing . another flat looking beer . aroma is awesome . lost abbey makes some aromatic beers . tons of dark fruit , bourbon , toasted and caramelized sugars . flavor is wonderful . very toasty but caramel and toasted sugars . dark fruits and bourbon in the finish with some booz and sugary roast . fantastic . mothfeel needs more carb as usual with lost abbey beers but its not bad . overall an amazing beer that probably is n't higher rated because of their carb issues . grab one if you can .

1.00 1.00 0.60 1.00 0.90	apperance- a light copper ale with a thin white head that lasts for a good while . smell- just an amazing aroma ! ! ! full of hops , but its not pungent or over powering . very floral taste- the malt is very light not much there at all , mildly sweet . as for the hops bitterness is low and just like the armoa it tastes floral and not over powering mouthfeel- this beer is light in gravity , mildly carbonated . even though there is great amount of hops and not much malt in this brew it is very ballanced and smooth . drinkability- i love this beer . i can drink this beer all day on a hot summer day . great taste , ballanced and with a low/average abv % it is something that you can enjoy many of without killing yourself

1.00 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70	bottle holiday wine cellar escondido , ca black as can be with a thick , persistent light brown head . sheets and dots of lacing are left down the glass . perfection ! an interesting aroma for an imperial stout : roasted malt , milk chocolate , and graham cracker crumbles . it 's interesting and quite intoxicating . the flavor is n't nearly as nice as the aroma , unfortunately . there 's simply not a ton here : roasted malt , light chocolate , and a bit of sugary sweetness , but not much else . thin to medium bodied with low carbonation . this was really disappointing ( because i had such high expectations ) . while this is gorgeous and quite aromatic , it just does n't do it for me in either the taste or mouthfeel departments . while certainly a decent big stout , i wo n't feel like i 'm missing out if i do n't ever have this again -- which is too bad , because i was hoping i 'd love this stuff -- it 's so inexpensive !

1.00 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	l20011021 on the cork cover , im thinking 21 oct 2001 ( ? ) this brew pours a wonderful brown color . a thick off white head is on top and stays on top for quite a spell . it slowly fades to a thick lace . aroma is kind of week . hints and only hints of dark fruit and candy are present . there is a more dominating musty , horse blanket aroma to this beer . taste is kind of thin up front . i have a hard time pulling anything out . yeasty flavors are out front followed by a hint of malt and a bitter dry finish . a bit watery in the mouth and not a bunch going for this beer except for the hype on the label . other than looking great in a glass , that is about this entire brew has going for itself . try if you must .

0.30 0.50 0.50 0.40 0.40	color was darker than straw but lighter than golden . head was there and gone in the flash of an eye , never to return . no lace . aroma of uncooked grain . lots of carbonation , more than i expected even from a lager . taste is mostly malt , very dry , with some cooked corn . very reminiscent of an american adjunct lager but with a considerably more bitter finish . light body .

1.00 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	a : well the appearance is about as nice as they come . you get the beautiful nitrogen show and then it settles with a dark brown , almost black , body with a nice light tan head . s : man this beer smells doesnt have much smell to it . it has some chocolate and coffee with a nice amount of malt . t : i really enjoy the taste of this beer . it has a nice roasted malt with some earthy tastes . i am also getting some caramel and a lot more malt . m : this has to be one of the smoothest beers of all time . there is a little bit of crispness , but you hardly notice . just amazing o : i know on this site this beer doesnt get great reviews , but man it is very tasty to me . i find it to be easy to drink , tasty and easy to find . this isnt the best stout on the market at all , but this is a nice beer .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.80	presentation : green bottle , green label . brewed in holland . pour : pours very little head , lacing remains until the drink is finished . color : sraw yellow . nothing too special smell : bitter . taste : much better than the american macros , but that is not saying too much drinkability : extremely drinkable , but not enough to make up for its other short comings . you are better off saving your money and buying something a bit cheaper .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	appearance is beatiful dark dark black with a fluffy , pale yellow head that laces nicely . smell is roasted malt and cofee with a hint of hopy sweetness and some funk thrown in . taste is bizzare . starts of malty and roasty with cofee notes which fades quickly ( but not completely ) to a puckering bretty sourness , finishing on a mix of sourness , roasted malt in the back , and some hop bitterness coming through . definitely complex and unique . mouthfell is fine , medium to light body , would have liked it a bit heavier . drinkibility not bad , i thought it would be worse with the sourness of the beer . overall this was definitely a unique beer . it was good too , better than i thought it would be . i wouldnt have thought brett sourness and stout would go well togther but it works .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured light copper color , with 2 finger white head . a = faint toasty-ness , not too much else going on here . t = little bit more of the toasty flavor , but its pretty weak . the hops barely show up here , just enough to keep it from being unbalanced to the sweet side . mouthfeel is maybe a notch below medium . overall this is just a really typical offering from point , which average at best . seems like every aspect of this beer needs to be bumped up a notch or two . this is just to light overall for me .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	week old 64oz growler . a : pours dark black , looks thick , very thin head on all glasses poured . s : dry bitter chocolate , dark roasted malt . also light coffee . t : bitter chocolate and coffee , roasted malt sweetness is light . a hop . though taste wise i think shakespeare stout is a little better . m : thick and somewhat syrupy . low carbonation . d : glad i got a growler , could almost do the 64oz myself though i would regret it .

0.20 0.20 0.40 0.30 0.20	there is nothing about this whatsoever that said `` beer '' to me , other than the fact that it 's called a lager . a : grape soda . s : some sort of mixed berry soda . t : third time 's a charm : soda . there was n't anything about this that tasted like a beer . extraordinarily sweet and somewhat syrupy . m : sticky . is that a way to describe mouthfeel ? i mean , it just felt ... sticky . d : it looks , smells , and tastes nothing like a beer . incredibly sweet , almost medicinal . i hate to review a beer like this , but ... it just bore so little resemblance to such a well respected beverage that i could n't bring myself to say anything good about it .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.70	nitro-tap , nice pour into a pint glass at henry 's 12th street tavern in portland . color is brownish-black , thick tan head has excellent retention all the way to the end . `` lacing '' does n't do this one justice . it more leaves a thick foamy coating on the whole glass . ( due to the nitro ? ) i 'm not sure i 've seen anything like it before . smell is sweet malty , definite milk chocolate , just a little bit of dark roast malts but mostly sweet . the closest thing i 've come to drinking a hershey 's bar in the beer world , for sure . i do n't taste much of the bitter , baker 's chocolate . it 's more the smooth , sweet milk chocolate , with just a bit of dark roast barley and an almost indiscernible amount of earthy hops . just enough to remind you that it 's a beer . the nitro probably makes this already smooth , creamy stout all the more so . medium body , sticks in your mouth . i think the `` lace '' is doing the same thing in my mouth , it lasts . to be honest , i 'm not much of a fan of the milk and sweet stouts i 've tried but this is my favorite . i like a more bitter , hopped , drier stout . despite that , this is a quality beer that lives up to its name , my tastes aside . perhaps part of the reason is that it 's hard to pair a beer like this with food for me , except maybe as or with dessert .

0.30 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.50	poured from a 12oz bottle into a us tumbler pint glass . a : the beer is a very pale yellow color , with a thin white head that fades very quickly and leaves almost no lace on the glass . s : the aroma is of light malts , honey and some spice , with a touch of hops . t : the taste has a little bit more sweetness than most in the style , with flavors of corn and honey . there 's a very mild hops presence . the after-taste is slightly sweet . m : crisp with a little smoothness , light body , medium carbonation , clean finish . d : a little flavorful , goes down very easily , not filling at all , mild kick , it 's not bad for the style but it 's something i 'd only drink if there were n't much else to choose from .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	i am making an effort to clear some of the beer out of my basement and dorothy had been sitting down there , patiently awaiting our rendezvous ( es ) since yesterday evening . we woke up together this morning and she was ready for a second go-'round as was i , so here we are . from the bottle : `` a bottle conditioned ale - pour slowly to retain natural sediment in bottle . best served slightly chilled . '' aye aye to all of the above . rilly ? ! ? slightly chilled ? a hot number like dorothy ? a quick cool-down in the shower may be in order . save water , drink beer ! save water , shower with a friend ! really save water , drink beer while showering with a friend ! she is nodding in assent , so away we go . i 'm back , dorothy with me , slightly chilled . i went with a very gentle pour as she is not into the rough stuff and i did not want to agitate any yeast in the bottle . no worries , though , she has no yeast problems , in case anyone was wondering . no head , other than wisps , at this time but a beautiful garnet color with ne-quality clarity . there is a real reason that milfs are gaining popularity - many women get better with age , dorothy hopefully among them . nose had a caramel/toffee sweetness , suggesting that the hops had faded in the aging process . mouthfeel was thin with a sherry-like dryness and a very mild bitterness in the mouth . in looking at the style description , it strikes me that dorothy has aged quite nicely . it probably helped that it was bottle-conditioned , but i make no apologies for having forgotten her . i just got overwhelmed with work at one point and could not give my stash of beer the attention that it deserved . finish was likewise dry , the hops making a grassy appearance at the extreme finish . thanks for hanging in , dorothy !

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	made a great appearance , poured a classic beer golden with a very large creamy foamy white head with a lot of sticking . had a good aroma , grainy and fruity with accents of sweet malt . had a good mouth feel , well carbonated with a slight alcohol sting on the tongue over a very drinkable medium body . taste was a very nice mellow graininess and fruitiness with a mild fruity hop bite in the finish , very balanced . a very good belgian strong pale ale , another winner from brouwerji van steenberge .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.80	i must say i 'm not a big fan of this beer since i expected it to be more elegant and subtle in terms of taste , but i started to dislike it from the beginning when i got a glimpse of its smell . poured it into my wiezen glass , it made a 1-1/2 finger foam , which was something i expected to be different . taste is refreshing at first but boring afterwards , as it left an acid mark in my palate and a very `` sandy '' aftertaste ( imagine you had put a load of beach sand in your mouth ) . the aftertaste is most definitely not pleasant , and it can be related to a one left by a hoppy but cheap beer . i served it chilled and its taste was decent , but once it decreased maybe a couple of degrees , its flavor definitely changed a bit .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.70	appearance- pours a mildly murky mix of gold , hay , and amber.very mildbubbling , but a great foamy head and good lacing.looks like an ipa , with some belgian flair . smell- very floral hops mix with some spiced breads . maybe a touch of soap . but still enticing . taste- starts with a litle spiced spruce needles , then to a fresh bouquet of hop flowers . more astringent than bitter.the malts take on a grainy spiced , bread flavor.a little nutty and a few hints of green apples . mouthfeel- astringent , slightly warming , and very cleansing . a nice belgian interpretation of an ipa .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90	a : brown bottle , pours crystal clear pale orange-yellow with effervescent carbonation and a thin white head that leaves the odd bit of lace . s : initial unpleasant , vaguely sour aroma . fades into a spicy/peppery , stereotypical noble hop aroma . that first noseful , though , not great . t : light with some grainy background and a subtle peppery noble hop quality . the flavors are distinct , but well balanced . m : smooth and moderately carbonated , it may go down a little too quickly . d : very good overall . everything is in balance , not unlike a macro lager , but without any minor offensive flavors .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.40 0.50	poured the carta blanca from a bottle to a pint glass . it had a clear , golden appearance . very , very thin looking . had almost no head to speak of . the smell was overly sweet . too much malt and sugar . the taste was thin to say the least . while there was a slightly pleasant sweetness to it , the overall texture was so thin and watery you could n't really enjoy it . very little carbonation , so there 's not much to say here . it 's like having flavored water in your mouth . this is not a very drinkable beer . it has little to no originality and has zero aftertaste to it . very weak in the flavor department .

0.90 0.40 0.60 0.80 0.60	12 bottle from a six pack . appearance : pours dark brown , but is clear with ruby highlights when held to light . off white head of about one finger never completely fades , and the lace curtains you get from sipping leave sticky spots on the glass . looks really good . smell : what a letdown . very little aroma at all . a little sweet malt and not much else . taste : much better than the smell . a surprising amount of hoppiness . the malt is roasty and sweet . there 's a little bit of raisin flavor in there too . the finish is roasty and a little bitter . mouthfeel : not as full as i 'd like . yeah , it feels a little watery . drinkability : this is a pretty good beer and its easy drinking enough . i drank a few on draft and really enjoyed them , but this just doesnt stand up to many of the old ales out there .

0.30 0.30 0.50 0.30 0.30	a - this comes in the most elegant package . the bomber sized bottle is wrapped in a silky gauzy gown of white material covered in kanji characters . the beer , however , is pretty lame looking . it 's yellow , pale , and clear with a fizzy white head . looks like any american macro . blah . s - not assertive at all , this smells like rice and nickels . i do n't like metallic flavors in my beer , and i can already tell that this is going to be a coppery mineral water type brew . weak , corny , and ricey . t - yeah ... .this is n't very good . i was really excited about this one since it 's one of the most beautifully packaged beers i 've ever seen , but looks can be deceiving . this is pretty boring and corny with lots of metallic mineral water notes . m - this is sort of a redeeming quality for this beer . it 's thin and overly carbonated , but thirst quenching and palate cleansing . d - this beer is pretty boring , and almost nasty . in a blind taste test , this could be confused for natural light or something of that ilk . pass .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.50 0.80	bought the bottle at blanchard 's in jp . served the beer in a hefe glass . has to be one of the better looking beers i have ever poured . university of texas , burnt orange color and beautiful head that was reminiscent of vanilla ice cream on top . the smell was not what i expected from a dunkelweizen . it seemed to lack any strong phenols other than clove . i sort of like to smell gueze or banana in a beer like this . also , the beer was a bit too assertive with the hops . i would prefer to have the phenols and malts speak for this style . as for taste and mouth feel , it too was not overly impressed with the beer as it relates to this particular style . again , i would have to say that the hops ( and hop oil ) take away too much from the malt and yeast flavors . that said , the sourness of the yeast is present but it competes with an odd `` gritty '' taste as you drink . overall , i would have to say that the beer lacks anything dynamic that i would expect to see from this particular style . ein prosit der gemtlichkeit !

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.60	this did indeed deliver on the blueberry ! strange purplish liquid with a bubblegum pink non lasting head . smell and taste are distinctly blueberry juice added to a very watered down cheap beer . much closer to soda pop ! overall , if you really love blueberry , you might like it . watch out though , its a relatively high abv !

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.70	22oz bomber . pours a hazy light auburn in color . plenty of head and very nice lacing . smell is subdued hops . taste is much the same . plenty of bittering piney and grassy hops . just a hint of citrus hop underneath , but you have to push to find it . decent brew , but unfortunately i 've been drinking a lot of hopslam lately and this just ca n't compete .

0.30 0.40 0.30 0.30 0.40	i 've consumed enough beer at mexican restaurants to have had this beer before , but i 'd never really thought about what it tasted like and actually thought to compare to ... other beers . appearance is slightly darker than most mainstream american lagers . there is little to no head and no lacing of any kind . nothing about this particular example of this beer indicates that anything special went into this beer ( this is from a can ) . smell is practically non-existent . taste is very much of corn , and is rather sweet , like coors light . the next time i have mexican food , i suspect i 'll save myself a few $ $ 's and drink something domestic instead ... it wo n't be missed .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	bought this one in dublin pours dark brown/almost black with small fizzy off-white head than dissipates fast , no lacing . aroma is fruity coke , weak sweetish caramel malt with hints of alcohol - it is not unpleasant , but not something i would expect from a stout . taste is sharp bittery roasted , slightly sourish , hints of citrus fruit , feels watery ; not much of aftertaste . thin mouthfeel , rather high carbonation . overall , i was surprised how bad this beer was - finally i poured it down the drain . although the `` best before '' date is fine , i will try another one before writing this beer off .

0.20 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.50	had on draft in varna , bulgaria near the aquarium a : pale yellow , no carb beads , no head , flat as pita bread s : stale bready aroma ; old , yeasty ; not a typical macrobrew smell t : not as bad as it could be , and other bulgarian beers are ; brown banana and a bit of pear come through what is a typical lager m : bit watery and dead overall , nothing to go out of your way for ; but by other reviews it sounds like i did all right by getting it on draft in varna .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60	a - quite a beautiful opaque orange body with finger hight white head . s - very malty ( strange for a hefe ) , average yeast aroma for the style and very spicy and sweet aromas . t - for all the sweet aroma , this beer is particularly dry . not very complex at all , but the typical wheat yeastyness . m - larger than average wheat body , but nice and smooth . d - pleasant , but for one of my favorite breweries , a let down .

0.70 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.40	appearance - pours deep brown with a low transmission depth and thick two finger frothy tan head that takes forever to fade and leaves no lacing behind . mix in the yeast , and no appearance change . smell - a very faint odor that smells a little like club soda and a bit of malt . none of the usual fruity esters and spice odors i 've come to expect . i would n't call a club soda odor unpleasant , but it is definitely not impressive . taste - ummm , it tastes like club soda and alcohol . underneath there is a bit of malt and some bitter fruity notes in the finish , but i can barely pick this out at all . it is n't really bad , it 's just extremely weak . as it warms more malt and a characterless bitter aftertaste are revealed . mouthfeel - very high carbonation makes it extremely frothy . it is thin . it is superficially refreshing , but moments after i swallow , my saliva feels thick and parched . drinkability - this is a wheat beer , even dunkel weizens go down incredibly smooth and easy . it is n't like i will have difficulty finishing this , but this particular dunkel weizen i will never buy again . disappointing . 16.9 oz bottle . exp - 12/2005

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40	from the dead man 's chest . nov 12th 08 this ale boasts a golden amber body that supports a proud white head . the apperiance is clear and the head leaves intricut lacing . there an aroma of cinnimon and pumpkin . there is a good beer in here the additions of the spices is all to aggressive . theres plenty of pumpkin with out overshowing the malt and hops but then you get blasted by spices to the point of tannic bitterness . it totaly ruined the beer of me .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	i am sampling a bottle of this beer and pouring into a pint glass . the beer pours a dark brown color with a frothy beige head foaming up and fading quickly to an edge layer . aroma is rich chocolate candy bar and some cocoa powder chalkiness too . very rich on the nose . first sip reveals a smoooth texture and very light carbonation . flavor is roasted malt up front and some chocolate . the finish is slightly grassy hops . the body really thins out to almost watery on the finish . while this doesnt really do it for me i know it is typical of english porters . overall this is a tasty and easy to drink beer . just dont expect a robust brew !

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	poured a dark almost clear golden color with a fluffy white head.. no lacing to speak of . faint banana odor with some wheat malthint of of spice with sweet malt taste up front . banana flavor hits in the after taste . nice mouthfeel . no prob drinking a few of these .

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.60 0.60	new holland mad hatter ipa 12 oz bottle recent bottling , tumbled down the rabbit hole 10/06 medium pour in a tulip glass . poured a hazy copper orange with a frothy mostly lasting white head with excellent lacing . smelt of moderate lemon/lime and floweriness . taste was upfront strong grassy nutty bitterness with light lemon accents followed by a strong earthy resiny bitterness accompanied by a moderate toasty bitterness on a long slighltly bittersweet flowery finish . mouthfeel was medium bodied , watery on a dry finish , soft then lively carbonation , with heavy astringency . overall , a seemingly pleasant ipa , that tastes wonderful at first , but then bites back too hard and dies flowery . it 's like an a.d.d . hop . the hop taste is too generalized and all over the place and not enough malt backbone to settle it down . still pleasant on the nose and eyes and foretaste though .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	i 'm wondering whether there was something wrong with my bottle ... the pour gives some real lively carbonation , like soft drink style , with an audible fizz , was n't expecting that . no problem though , taste is fine , colour is nice and although there is no head and very little in the way of lacings , the body is pretty nice . sweetness on the nose , berries , maybe a little bit of peach ... everytime i put it up to my nose i get something different , but mostly sweet fruit with noticeable alcohol . first thing i pick up is the malt . the grain really comes through , the strong alcohol giving a whiskey note to it but without much wood . a good amount of red , slightly sour fruit , gives off a nice , but very subtle , tartness . gentle english hops throughout keeping a nice balance and the sweetness at bay . finish is a little disapointing . taste fades quickly , leaving a tonic water type flavour and a slight dryness in the mouth . despite the fiziness , the mouthfeel is fine . thin , but in that loveable english ale sort of way . this i dangerously drinkable for a strong ale . the british ability to completely mask alcohol is unnerving . i 'd drink this again .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.60	the first thing that i noticed about this beer was its color . it seems rather light in color -lemon yellowish- for the pumpkin ale style . the head forms at less than one finger and quickly dissipates . it is pretty white in color at from what little bit remains , it looked like it might have had a creamy appearance to it . barley any lacing . not very impressed by the appearance of this one . the aroma of this beer does a nice job of hitting stylistic guidelines . it is easy to smell and is fairly potent . spices are easily detectable in the aroma ; cinnamon is chief among them , and there is also a nutmeg aroma . it smells pretty much like a good pumpkin pie ought to smell . of course there is also a pumpkin backbone to this beer 's nose . no hop aroma , and the malt is hard to detect over the spices and pumpkin aromas . the overall taste of this beer is nice . there is a nice balance between the various ingredients in this beer . the spices are not overpowering or cloying , and the pumpkin and malt give this beer a nice background . hops have no impact on the flavor of this beer , except for their bittering characteristics which do a nice job of offsetting the spices , pumpkin and malt . i was a bit disappointed in the mouthfeel of this beer . i was expecting something with a bit of a thicker body . the body of this beer is medium bodied . it finishes dry and goes down easy . all in all this is a pretty good beer , but i do believe that there are better examples of this style out there . i will probably buy this beer again , however it will probably be this season as i will be trying to get my hands on as many pumpkin ales as possible .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	serving glass : poured from bottle into tulip . appearance : mostly clear but slightly dulled yellow with surprisingly substantial foamy head and lots of lacing . smell : sweet , grainy and adjuncty with some belgian yeast characteristics of clove and banana . taste : similar to the aroma , it is too sweet and grainy . that said , it has some nice layers of fleshy fruit , banana and clove . ends with a titch of spicy hops ( styrian ? ) feel : moderately high carbonation , medium body . not as dry as a great tripel , but many american-made tripels that are not gluten-free are still like this . overall : not bad for gluten-free , but people with gluten issues ultimately would be better served by drinking wine , hard alcohol , cider , etc .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.30 0.40	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glas 2 inch off white head on top of a deep coppery garnet , modestly carbonated . aroma : caramel malt , fruitiness like apples and a slight floral hoppiness . taste : powerful sweet maltiness comes on in on a woosh . back taste has a medicinal alcoholic ester with a buttery diacetyl aftertaste . notes : too strong , too sweet . too alcoholic . combination of esthers & diacetyls remind me of vanilla extract and caramel apples . i would classify this as an imperial english pale ale .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	noticed a bottle of judgment day sitting in the fridge , had it while watching an episode or reaper , go figure . in to a maudite tulip it poured a deep dark amber , bubbly but no real head . small bubbles everywhere , during the pour , after sitting for a while , dancing on the tongue during sips . a rim of light brown bubbles congregated at the edge of the brew . tastes of malt , but obvious presence of the lost abbey plum/raisin base ... sort of a dulled fruit sweetness . not overly sweet but sleight . constant tiny bubbles cleanse the palette after every sip . slightly hot , and i notice the alcohol fairly quick . aroma seems to be a less malty but blandy sweet ( i.e . raisin ) waft . after part of a glass , i had it with some grilled ( no sauce ) chicken but found it matched amazingly with some artisan multigrain/hearty bread . interesting , fun to drink with food , but perplexing by itself . it looks for complexity but leaves you with prune/raisin/plum . after enjoying a bottle i realized that i should not be driving nor operating heavy machinery . beware the judgement day !

1.00 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70	12oz bottle poured into a pint glass . first with leaving a half inch of beer at bottom , then with pouring 3/4 into glass then swirling bottle and pour rest into glass . a : one finger head that retains well , little lacing , cloudy yellow color , lots of bubbles . yeast at bottom of bottle . s : fruity smell , and hops smell when leaving half inch of beer at bottom . when mixing yeast , the yeast had an over powering smell of yeast . t : same as smell . a bit to light . did n't pick up a whole lot . little to light . when mixing yeast with beer , had a over powering yeast taste . m : light body , medium carbonation . d : easy to drink . a bit to weak for a hefeweizen . the first beer i had i poured the whole thing in , leaving about a half inch of beer to keep yeast out . got some smell and flavor out of it making it an ok beer . then i read the bottle ( i alway read the bottle after i have my first beer so it doesnt change my own idea of the beer ) . it says to pour 2 thirds of the beer then swirl and pour the rest . after doing this on my second , the yeast was to over powering . really didnt like it after doing this . for the rest of the six pack ill stick to leaving the yeast out . wont buy again . would drink again tho , if its free ...

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	lighter than i expected , more yellow-orange than copper . nice , obvious , chunky yeast floating alongside persistant streams of bubbles . head and lace fell quickly , but carbonation lasted . initial and final tastes of citrus with bite that ends like mineral water . very light-bodied , but does n't at all taste like a tripel . something musky or tropical lies underneath the hops , but it 's hard to classify .

0.50 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.80	poured jet black with about a 1/2 '' of brown head . below average head retention & lacing t : slight smokeyness , chewy chocolate & some oaky notes up front . ( from being aged in a whisky barrel , i reckon ) some coffee & vanilla notes as this warms . finishes dry , sweet with chocolate & a little caramel mf : chewy with near zero carbonation . oily & pretty heavy bodied drank easy for the abv , not a bad effort , just not complex enough to go crazy about

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	have had this one a few times , reviewed from notes . pours out almost pitch black but some light shines through around the edges . a nice fluffy , off-white two finger head has nice retention and leaves heavy lace behind . a huge pillow stays on top of the beer . smell is of roasty malts , cocoa and slight coffee notes . earthy and grassy hops shine through in a nose with good strength . the taste is of roasty malts , caramel/sweets , and some coffee and cocoa notes . nice earthy/grassy hops to balance off the taste . the mouthfeel is a moderate body with pretty nice creaminess and moderate carbonation . a coat of earthy hops stays on the tongue and the body feels a bit oily . drinkability is nice . it is definitely a good session beer . heavy flavors with a great price . a good porter that is being retired apparently , it 's too bad ...

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.70	a : hazy , pale straw color . poured a 2 finger white head that dissipated to skim around the inside edge of the glass . no lacing on the glass . s : sweet , crackers and wet grain . faint green apple and grass . t : just like the nose up front ; sweet , wet grains . transitions quickly to a low , even bitter . m : light body . moderate carbonation ( a little low for the style ) . smooth and refreshing . o : very sessionable ; the lower than expected carbonation may even help here . missed the style a bit in appearance ( helles=bright ) .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	a : it just does not get much better than the look of this stuff in a pint glass . jet black ... amazing tan head . s : other than roasted grains ... not much . t : i used to think this was the the cadillac of beer . other craft beers leave this lacking now . decent enough but just not earth shattering . still ... sometimes ya just got ta have one as they are a solid , nice beer . m : great creaminess in the beginning leads to some thinness on the back side . d : only average as far as a stout ... .but a great sessionable beer due to the low abv and relatively low cost . i just paid a tad over a buck a can for an 18 pack at woodman 's in kenosha .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60 0.50	sa had some labeling issues with this puppy , but it came out nonetheless . pours nothing like a pale ale . kind of thought it had to be pale to be a pale ale , but whatever . decent 3/4 inch head that leaves a thin ring . the first thing i smell is adjunct grains with a little bit of oaky smoothness . not overly impressive . the taste isnt all that special either . light and airy like an adjunct lager . the addition of caramel malt stands out here . it would be a decent marzen , but not what i want in an apa . i like the sweetness from the caramel malt . definitely the highlight of the beer . its just much too smooth and too light for me . it needs something . theres an underlying sweetness that feels like brown sugar . way too many sweet flavors here . needs more of a grain or alcohol backbone to compliment the sweetness .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.60	slightly hazy deep garnet / brown hue w/ a light tan head that promptly recedes into a meager thin ring . nutty , sweet dark caramel and chocolate malt along with hints of roasted barley . mildly spicy hop nose . light chocolate is perceived at first in flavor , then fades quickly to allow one dimensional dark caramel malt sweetness to dominate the flavor profile . an out of place light tartness emerges late palate along with subdued biscuit malt . hop bitterness is low , and leaves caramel malt sweetness unhindered . lightly bodied , and thin , borderlining watery in mouthfeel . finishes w/ a hint of butterscotch , but otherwise bland and clean . not a particularly good brown ale . thin and uninspired . passable drinkability .

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	on-tap in a flute at the capital ale house in richmond , this beer arrives orangey and crystal-clear , with low carbonation and a thin , vanishing head . smells sour , lactic , tart , and lemony acidic . the flavor adds to this a slight woodiness , medium bitterness , and a delicious , fresh mozzarella character . there is little , if any sweetness , which enhances the extreme dryness of its medium , mildly carbonated body . very refreshing ; assertive , but not overwhelming , and i think the cheesy element to the flavor is a tasty novelty .

0.90 0.40 0.70 0.80 0.80	pours a hazy amber color with a finger-thick white seafoamy head that leaves decent amount of lattice on the sides of the glass . aroma is of fairly mild pine hops . fairly boring . i really had to work to get this to even hit my nose . tasting it , the flavor far outweights the aroma in a pleasing manner . cascade hops along with a biscuit flavor hits my palate right up front . hops still remain on my tongue long after the swallow , which is nice . prickly carbonation hits my tongue up front and then through the middle with a medium-bodied brew . nice staying power on the flavor and this one is has a bit more `` oomph '' than the pale ale ( thank god ) . very drinkable brew . yummy , enjoyable , and the alcohol is decent at 6.5 % . i could easily drink a 6er of it .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.70	bottled may 2006 , batch 2 . pours a dark amber with a thin head that is still much more than you 'd expect for a beer this strong , spotty lacing lasts on my stone old guardian glass . the aroma is dominated by alcohol and sweet caramel with a hint of oak . the taste is very complex , but the general medicine-like alcohol gets in the way . there is a good blend of oak , vanilla , caramel and a nice but sharp pine hoppiness provides the best backbone it can for all that malt . the beer is very heavy on the palate and very sweet . this is one that takes a long time to drink , and pretty much leaves me ready to go to bed .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.90 1.00	thanks to jac5084 for bringing this one out last night . i ca n't remember the bottle number but it was in the two hundreds . poured this into two unbranded snifters . a : this one is amazingly photogenic . looks like a perfect ris : pitch black with barely no brown around the edges , even when held up to a bright light . an incredibly creamy , frothy and sticky dark khaki head forms and sticks around for quite a bit . impeccable . s : the smell was a tad disappointment . smell is initially dry roasted coffee , slight dry cocoa powder and hops . the hops thew me off , but as i continued to smell it , i really started to enjoy the bitterness that the hops were contributing to the smell . this is the second hoppiest smelling ris , second only to darkness . t : taste is very dry , but very smooth . taste is like an imperial coffee stout . tons of dry roasted coffee in the taste coupled with very dry cocoa powder ( cocoa nibs ? ) . as far as fruit flavors go , i could not depict any in the taste . it is a simple taste , but very smooth and enjoyable . d : this is one of the most drinkable ris i have ever had . i drank this one way too fast as it was so smooth and the alcohol was nowhere in sight . overall , this is a great ris . i wish it was more readily available , because this was so drinkable and i could have one every night .

0.40 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90	on tap at the brewery in cleveland , ohio . i recommend that all great lakes brewing company beers are enjoyed from the tap since imo they are better than the bottles . finding them in bottles without the option of the tap is perfectly fine though . a miller lite with a thicker head . it is not a slam or anything but this is what this beer looked like when i was served it at the brewery . s barely there ... very faint smell if at all . t slight wheat taste , pleasant . grainy . m smooth , light . d good to great due to its light qualities . notes : one of the more drinkable glbc beers .

0.60 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.90	this is a wow witbier . cloudy yellow with tendencies toward something darker , more orange . the head is a little flat , though . there 's a good flowery perfume aroma . soft citrus , light coriander come up front wiht a good dry wheat in the finish . this is a little heftier than the supposed style stalwart , hoegaarden , but the soft , almost creamy mouthfeel makes this a surprisingly satisfying beer without being heavy . tasty beer .

0.60 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	pours a hazy amber colour with small fizzy white head that disapates quickly . nose of caramel malts , grapefruit hops , and pine . initial taste grapefruit hops overlayed but a mild syrupy caramel malts . slight sticky mouthfeel . finishing with a coating bitter hops and sweet malts . palate duration is excellent . medium body . definitely very drinkable .

1.00 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	a - extremely dark brown body topped by a frothy bark tan head standing a couple inches tall . the head has some great stamina ! the lacing this beauty leaves is also worth noting . s - cough syrup & dark chocolate . t - chocolate flavors with a sweet coffee note . there 's a nice accent throughout each pull of this brew . m - super smooth throughout . the finish is solid as it offers a nice tingle . ~ i 'm a big fan of most sam adams brews and this one is no exception . i 'll happily tip these back while recommending my friends do the same .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	this is a good pub ale . have had it on draught and in a can and either way is mellow and tasty . serious creamy head . it gets extra points because it is best you can get in a can at the 7-11 near my apartment . if you have n't planned and need a reasonable beer last minute boddingtons will make you happy .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.70	from a jenny lou 's in beijing 500ml can clear , light , golden yellow color . decent head soon fades to ring . good lacing ! some spicy , grassy hop aroma , hint of malt . some yeast and even metallic notes . otherwise , a bit subdued , almost muddled . taste is also a bit muddled , with some hop character and malt sweetness trying to peek through , but otherwise seems a bit watered down flavor-wise . that said , there 's nothing offensive to be found . feel is n't as watery as the taste might lead you to expect , and the carbonation is n't overly fizzy . maybe i was coming in with low expectations , with the previous sole reviewer giving such a bad score ? regardless , this should beat an american style macro any day ...

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	i had this on tap at a beer pub about 6 miles from the brewery about 3 years ago , and i honestly did not care for it at the time . it was a massive citrus hammer upside my head . i honestly do n't think my tastes had matured to appreciate it at the time . again this was 3 years ago , before i became a member of ba and a true beer fan . i have since tried it again , and it was waayyyy better then i remembered . the cascade hop explosion was still there , but i was able to handle it this time around and i really enjoyed it . ruby-amber color , bordering on red . awsome color . smells intensely hoppy , prickly and citrus heavy . a super rich , almost smoky dose of malt right off the bat ( i did n't remember this 3 years ago ) followed by a heavy blast of spicy-citrus hops that totally compliments the malt . a very full flavored brew and quite well balanced for an ipa . finish is quite citrus ( grapefruit ) like . a real mother of an ale .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	this bottle required a lot of work just getting the beer out of the bottle . the cork was just plain obstinate . i had to use a pair of pliers just to get the cork out . side note : i do n't get the term `` triple ipa . '' at what point do the ibu 's define the triple ipa ? i 'm being rhetorical . there is no real triple ipa . anything over 100 ibu 's ca n't be defined by the pallatte . when you get that high in ibu , then you really risk poor balancing . off the pour i get the tons of hop smell . the look is fantastic . the coloring a very deep orange/copper mix . i get tons of nice lacing in my st. bernardus chalice . the smell gets that heavy hop smell typical to a dipa ( or this triple ipa ) . it smells decent , but there is no distinguishing this beer bouquet . recalling my commentary above about ibu 's and balancing risk ... this beer is a very good example of how heavy ibu can hurt the balance of a beer . all i get is hop from this beer . the citrus is really heavy and so is the pine . the bitterness is overwhelming . i ca n't get any more flavors from this beer because no more flavor can come through . i really only recommend this beer to offset other strong flavors . it could pair with really spicy foods , but on it 's own ; this beer is too much to handle alone .

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	2006 appearance , great head and retention . easy to create head . smell of citrus hops dominates . makes my taste buds anxious in anticipation taste : hops are very apparent . citrus flavored hops pull through the most . the malt is a very strong backbone . the taste is almost a little too thick with malts . tastes almost syrupy . mouthfeel : a little thin , needs more carbonation . does not cling well . drinkability : i could see people making a session out of this beer . very easy to sip on . edit : 10-6-07 some aging has left the booziness of this beer settle . i was a lenient reviewer much more than i am now . the only thing that ups is the mouthfeel from a 3 to a 4.. 2006 edition bought in july of 06

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.90	a= pours a beautiful dark brown almost black color with a great two finger perfectly toasty looking head on it that holds awesome retention and wonderful lacing on the glass . s= oh the smell of porters . the one is n't as roasty as most porters i get in the nose . there is a lot of nice sweetness to it as well as some nice toffee in the nose . really smells a lot like toasty marshmellows . great smelling porter . t= the taste is top of the line for a porter . much more roast in the taste than the nose . there is a nice sweetness still that lies under the roast . great toffee flavor and less toasted marshmallow . a tasty porter indeed . m= great carbonation and a good medium heavy feel to it . not as silky as i like but still decent . d= a great porter . never had it and i heard a ton about it so i went out and got some . worth the pick up for sure . porters are my fav and i could sip this one for a while .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.50 0.60	this is another japanese standard . it 's a 205-yen-a-can beer that gives you exactly what you expect : no-nonsense , light-beer , a-bit-ragged-in-the-morning drinking . a : as expected , a very clear golden hue . the head was a little less than a half-inch deep and was filled with disproportionately-sized balls of air sitting in a sea of smaller , white bubbles . the head was gone in two minutes . s : not a whole lot going on . some sweet graininess on the nose , but 'low-impact ' is the only phrase that comes to mind . t : round , somewhat grainy front and almost no bitterness at the back . mass-produced wheat bread body . slight spray of astringency in the aftertaste . m : smooth . the carbonation is refreshing . d : quite easy to drink , this is a standard cooler beer at picnics and bbq 's during the summer here in japan . this is an easy brew to find in these here parts . by japanese standards ( quality and pricing ) , it 's a reasonable investment if you 're buying in bulk .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured from a 12 oz bottle from the 12 bottle mix pack from aldis . the color is a light straw/champagne color with a two finger head that melts away pretty quick with mild lacing . i have a poor sense of smell so im going with the current average of 3.5 flavor is run of the mill boring lager with plently of carbonation and medium crispness followed by a rather grassy hop flavor with some hints of lemon in there but no real bitterness . this is just another boring no frills lager , not bad but nothing to write home about . its cheap but ive only heard of this available in the mix pack . if one wants to argue dollars and sense im not real sure its much of a step above cheap bmc swill . maybe a little better as there was more complexity to the hops but nothing great .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a pale straw yellow color with a decent looking body and about two fingers of nearly pure white head . ample carbonation and the head is very fizzy , and as such it recedes quickly and leaves not a lick of stick or a trace of lace . smells include sweet pale malt , grain , and slightly fruity ( green apple ) , floral and spicy noble hops . the taste has a subtle sweetness but the malt is more grainy than sweet . there are plenty of hops in this one , lending a spicy note and also a good amount of bitterness . in the hop department this tastes like a pilsener . i 'm left with a lingering bitter grainy flavor on the palate , and it 's drying through the finish . this is light yet medium-bodied , with a crisp carbonation that seems appropriate . this is not my favorite style , but this is a refreshing beer and worth a try for sure .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	a - a cloudy brown body laced with deep red and orange hues . very thin white head with little lace . s - awesome aroma on this beer . deep and complex . i took multiple deep draws before even thinking of putting it to my lips . sweet currants of cherry and some hints of orange zest . the front is very sweet and carmalized . this is mixed with clove and other fine spices . then some slightly musty oaky booze come in on the back end to round it out . very nice t & m - gppd medium full bodied and coating with a somewhat clean finish and carbination that fades a little . the start is full of carmalized sweetness and dark fruits . the middle gets rather oaky and deep as some notes of vanilla and booze ( almost bourbon like ) . then the spices come in which open the palate back up to lighter more citrus fruits on the back end to clean the mouth . beautiful depth and complexity . o - a good job at a collaboration ! a great smelling and tasty concoction from avery and rr ! -cheers

0.50 0.90 1.00 1.00 1.00	a - pours darker than dark with a 1/8 of an inch head , no lacing at all . other than the impressive soulless black , it 's somewhat boring after the initial pour . s - freshly roasted coffee , milk & dark chocolate , only a hint of bourbon and vanilla . the coffee aroma is pungent , reminds me of walking into a coffee shop . t - nice even bourbon flavor throughout , chocolate notes all over the place , present but not overpowering coffee and espresso flavors . the coffee is mind blowing , a perfect blend of fresh roast with some mildly bitter acid and grinds makes for an incredibly satisfying balance of sweet thanks to the bourbon and chocolate and bitter from the dark chocolate and coffee . d - i let this one warm up and it was just a delicious and drinkable as it was when i first cracked it . even though most of the carbonation had vacated the beer , the viscosity of the beer still made it highly satisfying . i ca n't wait to crack another one of these open and try to continue pulling out all the nuances this has to offer .

0.50 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.60	a : the cap almost popped off the bottle because there was so much pressure . the head was more of a soda/ice cream float style carbonation that did really stay . there was still a slight caramel head over a dark coffee body . s : slight sweet chocolate and malty flavor immediately countered by a strong bourbon alcohol aroma coupled with a slight woodiness . t : there is a nice chocolate malt sweetness there but it is really slight and does not match the robust bourbon flavor that dominates this brew . d/m : the carbonation is robust but it is almost too much because it does not last very long . this wasnt a very heavy beer but still had a large presence of alcohol .

0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00 1.00	appearance = pretty average looking clear , light golden straw-amber . not much head at all . ok lacing . smell = good strong , clean hop flavor . bready malt is detectable also so it seems this one will be well balanced . hops are the dominant scent but are n't completely overwheming . taste = this is an exceptional tasting ipa . great hops flavor , extremely well balanced . crisp and clean and not overwhelming in any way . citrus hops dominate , grapefruit and lemon are prominant flavors . not much of a pine flavor but that 's fine with me . malt is noticeable as i thought it would be and compliments the initial flavors perfectly . overall = like the 90 minute , this is one of the better ipas in the world . outstanding drinkablity and taste . i could easily drink this in a session . very strongly recommended . right up there with sierra neveda 's celebration as my favorite ipa .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	a new interpretation of their epa , this beer was brewed with the same malts and yeast , but is kicked up with modern american hops ( citra , centennial and cascade ) and dry-hopped with the same varieties . ca n't wait to slug this one down ! 80 ibu 's , 6.5 % abv . pour is absolutely beautiful . copper center that slowly fades to orange on the edges , with a three finger white head that fell ever so slowly , becoming quite rocky and leaving huge chunks of foam clinging to the glass with a 1/4 inch cap that stuck around the entire length . big time hoppy aroma . loads of citrus , a bit of pine , orange , tangerine , and maybe just a touch of sweetness . but basically , the aroma is all fresh , bright hops . yep , flavor is right on with the nose . big time hop flavor , but not overly bitter like i was expecting , and this is a good thing . while it has a great bitter orange rind flavor , everything is well balanced between the citrus/orange/pine , while a mild bready maltiness rounds things out and keep things in check . solid body , moderate carbonation . pretty much everything i look for in a beefed apa or mellower ( in terms of alcohol percentage ) ipa . i listed this as an ipa since it 's got that big hop flavor and a slightly higher abv than what would be expected in an apa . even if it fell under either style , i 'd give it the same score because this truly is a great beer from a great mn brewery . cheers to 25 years , and i hope they have another wonderful 25 and more ahead of them !

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	a murky yellow/orangish , with a thin bubbly head . the lacing is patchy , the head maintains true to form . the smell is weaksome coriander and citrus like hops , backed with wheat crackers as warming takes place . carbonated and over-spicy ( peppery ) , coupled with light yeast tingling the palate . pasty apple jelly , very sour and tarty , with a ginger-ale like aftertaste . dull .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.90	i got this one from melbatoast93 , cheers hart . ( i also rxd a bottle from czcoh75 as well , so maybe age one ? ? ) pours mahogany/black with 1 finger of mocha/raspberry colored head . nice oily sheen to this , along with some head retention & lacing s : chocolate , dark fruit , & some oakyness t : dark chocolate , oaky , a bit of iron & much dark fruit up front . winey & plumy notes , along with a touch of licorice , smokeyness & ghost booze . finishes dry , oaky , plummy , raisiny & with a touch of port mf : oily , chewy , with semi-smoothness drinks really easy for the abv & style , despite the overwhelming complexity of this offering , a damn fine imp stout

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	generally my attitude towards pale ales is one of bewilderment . why drink a pale ale when you can take on an ipa ? remarkably i found myself in a bar in portland which was bereft of ipa , but , realising that one can rarely go wrong with a deschutes beer , i ordered a mirror pond . it was somewhere between amber and bronze with a slightly acidic smell which i would n't like to expand on since my venue was bigger on smoke than beer . the head was rather limited . this was rather hoppy for a pale ale ( immediately i was glad there was no ipa ! ) and boasted the usual creamy , raisin flavoured deschutes backing . they certainly were n't being stingy with the malt here . this was a well coordinated and very drinkable beer with a reasonable feel ( lots of small bubbles ) . perhaps i should drink more pale ale rather than ipa , but more likely i should drink more deschutes beer . i find deschutes to be the most dependable brewery ( never a bad beer ) . good stuff !

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	think imperial irish dry stout instead of russian imperial stout ... a : bottle opens with a 'gunshot pop '' and pours a dark black with a monstrous 2.5 '' dark tan head . fantastic retention . no faults here ... s : citrus , roasted malt , cocoa , and chocolate malt . light esters mixing in with the hopping . all very light aromas . t : acidic darker and roasted malt , the same cocoa as detected in the smell is present here as well . light hop bitterness backing it up . dry finish with a light roast and chocolate lingering . m : smooth and silky -- reminiscent of an irish dry stout . incredibly creamy -- intriguing , not what i was expecting at all . d : a very interesting and enjoyable beer . that said , it is n't anything like i was expecting . what i would expect an `` imperial irish dry stout '' to be like , if there were such a thing ...

0.30 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.40	poured a dark , hazy brown with lots and lots of floaters in it . so much that it was downright icky looking . some of them were the size of a fingernail . anyway , it smelled of hops and citrus , but was n't all that intense . taste was very average . compared with other west coast ipas , there was n't a whole lot going on . in fact , i did n't finish this one .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90 1.00	22 oz bomber bottle . a very good and extremely drinkable westcoast ipa , dangerously so at 7 % apv . the appearance is a soft and `` relatively '' clear light orange with a clumpy white head . but for some reason this bottle has sheets of sediment floating . i thought they were hop flower petals at first . they really detract from the appearance , but have no effect on taste or mouthfeel . the aroma is a nice grapefruit/citrus blend , but not overpowering to scare off newcomers to the hoppier westcoast ipas . the flavors are a very nice blend of malts and bracing hoppiness . a generous malty breadlike flavor gives way to smooth bitterness with just a slight snap in the finish . very drinkable for a beer of its potency . i would definitely put this in the stable of cross-overs beers into the more extreme ipas available on the westcoast .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.40 0.50	very fizzy , white head that quickly dissipates . orange in color , clear and very bubbly . plenty of spices in the aroma ; nutmeg , eggy kind of custard smell , some pumpkin , cinnamon , even a little potpourri . tastes kind of like the mr. beer home brew in a box . there 's a certain vitaminy taste to it . not much pumpkin in it . some spices , possibly nutmeg . maybe even something like dr. pepper is present . not much body and minimal mouthfeel .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.70	very heavy hefe pour . thick , deep yellow gold that glubglubs out of the bottle and leaves a giant head . smells of very , very strong wheatmalt and a surprising kick of yeast . these are very nice , but the spice is off , there 's a strange , almost medicinal node where you usually would find nanners and white pepper . the medicinal node is highly subdued in the taste , with the yeast picking up most of the slack . the result is uneven but still pleasant . not exactly what i 'm looking for a in a hefe but not bad in an of itself . i 'll have to try this one again to see whether or not i got a bad bottle . until then , this one is decent but a little off .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.70	aroma is a little faint ( might just be me ) . but at first i detected a little bit of a malty-sweet smell followed by some floral hoppy aromas . i might have smelled something like apple in there too . the colour is a golden copper with a little tinge of amber ( not enough amber to justify the name in my opinion ) . it produced a small white head that did not last long . no lace to be found at all . the flavour was not bold in any way . it is fairly balanced , but i 'd have to say that the malt comes out on the top . the hops are hardly even noticeable which directly opposes what the label claims that it tastes like . there was a bit of a metallic taste . there is some caramel in there too . mouthfeel is good for a lager in my opinion . i'ts medium bodied . avg carbonation ... maybe even a little less aggressively carbonated than an average lager . overall , i think it would be a great gateway beer for someone just getting into the world of craft beers .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	served up a breathtaking deep copper amber that is crystal clear . the head is slightly off-white and looks superb with tightly packed , shiny bubbles that stick around forever and leave near perfect lace . if this beer tastes nearly as good as it looks i will be most happy . the aroma is classic oktoberfest with plenty of toasty brown sugar malt . some toffee notes and a very clean maltyness beg me to take a sip . the flavor picks up where the aroma left off , but with perhaps a bit more breadyness . it is malty with plenty of toasted character and some nice toffee and brown sugar color to the flavor . once again it is very clean with some caramel and herbal hops that creep in towards the finish . if there is one thing that detracts from this beer is that though all the desired flavors are there , many of them seem a little flat . the mouthfeel is on medium to full with a slight chewiness and a nice slick finish . caramel and hops linger on the palate before the next sip . somewhat filling , but nicely drinkable . i could definitely put back a couple more of these with the wonderful soft pretzels they have here at the brewery . a very solid domestically brewed marzen .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	a welcome gift from my good friend brewtull . pretty dull on the pour ( into a shaker pint ) . head vanishes and leaves a lifeless ale . there is carbonation , just a few bubbles and nothing else to show for it . maybe lipids from the mac nuts or coconut ? amazing aroma , full of those toasty coconuts and mac nuts , plus the usual porter chocolate and hop notes . maybe coffee , but it certainly is n't screaming at me like i thought it would . silky , creamy , nutty , toasty , chocolatey , hoppy goodness . it 's really tasty . that coffee makes a real entrance here , it 's got that spicy , thin mouthfeel type-coffee vibe . the thing that 's really bringing it down is the high gravity . were it not so thick i could pound these all night . bring this back to 6 % abv and it would be a tko . just saying . cheers !

0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	pours dark orange with very small head , which disappears quickly , also there is almost no lacing . aroma is malty , very gentle , with flowery hops , some hints of grapefruit , maybe orange . flavour is quite similar to aroma , at first spicy , but then mild honey sets in with long a perfect bittery and warm afetrtaste . smooth mouthfeel . i bough it in drinks of the world in bern , i liked the label . but now i know this beer is magnificent , for sure i will drink it again ( and again )

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	this beer poured a delightful black into the glass , with about a fingerful of head . i was n't overly impressed with the smell , however the taste ; of dark chocolate , coffee and cinnamon more then made up for it . a very nice sipping beer , plenty of complexity to ponder .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	eye candy : transparent yellow-like , not even yellow.. the nose knows : let blue light warm , then smell it . it smells like vomit in a bottle . tongueland : the taste gives me the creeps . i actually have gagged while drinking blue light . bender factor : if for some reason you decide that tonight is crappy canadian beer night , molson canadian is the best choice . everyone here in buffalo thinks that blue/blue light is the the sheezy , i say it makes me queasy . labatt blue is a sad excuse for a beer . it should be put out of it 's misery . i feel bad for canadian citizens who are exposed to blue on a daily basis . that and the dude on hockey night .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	750ml bottle split with nicoco . poured into weyerbacher tulips . a : poured with about 1/4 '' of white head . nicoco says it 's `` look kinda like dehydrated piss yellow . '' fair enough , i can agree with that . it 's hazy . head does n't have too much retention , lacing fades quickly . s : banana , clove , lemongrass , maybe some pilsner malt and a hint of thyme . t : grainy , almost like a saison , but with some banana and honey overtones . m : very effervescent . the carbonation almost mimics a cold kombucha tea or champange . light bodied , yet sticky . very enjoyable . o : hard to compare this to anything as it 's in a pretty unique style . overall , i probably would n't seek out more gruits , however , this seems like it 's most likely a fine example of one .

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	22oz . anniversary beer served from the 22oz . bottle into a wide mouthed pilsner glass . appearance : pale golden with some haze that dissipated quickly . no lacing from the thin but tightly bulbed head . smell : slight yeast smell with hints of floral and citrus and a refreshing sweet smell . taste : the citrus and floral backed with the honey sweetness brings a refreshing bouquet to the sweetness of this beer . after the first couple sips i was very happy to be able to enjoy a large format of this beer . mouthfeel : great carbonation and a robust but light feeling that seems to compliment the summer belgian styling of this saison . drinkablity : enjoyable summer ale that would pair well with a strong cheese and some fruit .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.60	on-tap at back street ( irvine ) a : the pour is a shockingly bright yellow color , almost neon , with a white head . s : the nose is quite heavy on the spice notes . lots of pepper and coriander along with some sweet malt and candi sugar . some light yeasty bread character . t : the pepper is quite strong and a little too much for my tastes . some coriander gives the beer a `` belgian '' feel , along with some semi sweet malt that leans toward bready . m : the body is light to medium with a moderate level of carbonation . d : a little too spicy for its own good , and the appearance is off-putting . but not bad , i suppose .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	a : served from a 12 bottle into a surly pint glass . pours a dark brown almost black with very minimal thin head s : great aromas going on here . like an iced mocha with a some raisin characteristics . t : for being a lighter bodied beer there is a lot going on here . first you get a sweet coffee flavor which mellows into a deep dark chocolate finish . m : minimal carbonation which helps to accentuate the deep flavors . has sort of an oily texture on the tongue . o : a great beer ! the addition of lactose really helps to add some body into this 5.8 % beer . was disappointed with the lack of head so the appearance took a knock on points but overall a wonderful offering from brau brothers !

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80 0.90	poured from 12oz bottle . very glad to try this one out ! a- poured a amberish coppery orange color if that makes sense . one finger off white head that shows light retention . no real lacing on the sides of the glass . s- this is pretty much spot on for a pumpkin pie . lots of nutmeg with a hint of cinnamon . crusty grain aroma blends well with a balance of pumpkin . overall not too spice forward and vice versa . a great smelling pumpkin ale . t- spice forward from the first sip . nutmeg and some light notes of cinnamon with allspice as well . there is a sweet caramel malt base to this that works well with the flavor overall . pumpkin highlights blend almost perfect with the malt base . i can taste hints of pie crust but i just may want to think that with the flavor of this beer . m- medium mouthfeel . carbonation is good for the style . spices left on the palate with light caramel malts . aftertaste is pumpkin forward with light spicing and a touch of alcohol . flavors were well blended overall for the beer . alcohol had medium drying on the palate . clean and crisp tasting throughout . d- a sixer please ? ? this beer was fantastic and to be honest i would love to drink this one year around . a highlight in the pumpkin quest i have given myself this year . looking forward to this beer next year and the years to come .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.90 0.90	another random beer from oklahoma that i picked up on my last trip to tahlequah . my first impression is that the bottle is gorgeous - a nice dark glass with an elaborate label and a thin layer of deep blue wax over the cap . enough to keep the flavor sealed in , but not so much that it was a problem opening the bottle . if they took as much care with the beer as they did with the 22 oz . bottle , this should be delicious . appearance : just like the bottle , the beer itself is gorgeous . a deep , orange-ish , gold color with a nice thick , foamy head . the foamy head , of course , led to a nice , think lacing as well . smell : a very nice strong , hoppy smell . notes of citrus are present , but are more or less background noise , the hops seem to be the star of the smell . taste : not surprisingly , the atlas ipa has a very strong hop presence . notes of caramel are also noticeable , and surprisingly , the citrus `` background '' noise i mentioned above is still there - and it 's still seems to be in the background . i expected the citrus flavor to be stronger than the smell , but i am pleasantly surprised that the hops shine through . a smoky finish somewhat overwhelms the nice hoppy start , but that 's a minor complaint for an otherwise fantastic ipa . feel : the most noticeable feeling with this beer is the foamy head that stays strong throughout much of the beer . the foam that ends up on my upper lip masks the fact that , once in your mouth , the carbonation is not as lively as it looks . overall : i originally bought this bottle because i wanted to add a somewhat obscure ipa that i would n't be able to find at home to my list . i figured it would be enjoyable , but i was n't expecting to be blown away . when i finally cracked it open , though , i discovered a fantastic beer . the flavor is a bit too intense to have more than one or two , but that 's what i 'm looking for in a good ipa . as a side note , after reading some of the other reviews , i was shocked at the wide variety of experiences people had with this beer . it was almost as if we were n't all drinking the same thing . that said , i did n't open my beer for about three months after purchasing it , and there is no date on the bottle , so it may have been on the shelf at the store for a while as well . this may be a beer that does a little better with some aging .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.80	bottle : poured a pitch-black color stout with a huge dark brown color ahead with good retention and great lacing . aroma of roasted malt with some well balanced sweet malt with notes of black chocolate . taste is well balanced with great notes of creamy black chocolates and roasted malt . hops do n't play much of a role but body texture is creamy and well crafted with good carbonation and no signs of alcohol . very well made overall but i was expecting more character based on previous rating .

0.40 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.30	notes from 07/24/2010 : 12 oz bottle at 45 degrees into a snifter . best by : 09/2010 . a : it pours pitch black with no head whatsoever . it looks like a flat coke . s : a nice coffee , chocolate , and cherry blend . this was an enticing lure at least . t : a little chocolate , coffee , and smoke but later dominated by sour cherry juice ( think roasty porter mixed with lindeman 's kriek ) . gross . m : it has a light body - probably from cherry juice - with almost no carbonation and an atrocious aftertaste of rank cherry juice . d : this is a huge miss . it is impossible for me to enjoy this .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.90	poured a dark hazy brown , tan head , with good retention . aroma was subtle , chocolate whiff . taste was fairly complex , chocolate , clove , hint of banana , dark fruits . mouthfeel , was rather thin , and tangy . drinkability is very good , i enjoyed this , and thought it was a very respectable example of the style , i will try again .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.80	had on-tap at liberty steakhouse in myrtle beach a : pours a pale yellow with floaties . the floaties could be from the slice of orange that came in the glass . no head with no retention and no lace . pretty bland looking . s : smell is very wheaty . it 's a mixture of buttermilk biscuits and wonderbread . t : buttered biscuits with hints of orange and lemon . believe it or not this mixture actually works . not bad tasting overall and good for a style i usually do n't like . m : light ... very thin bodied , but not so much so that it 's watery . d : drinkability is good . like a mentioned before . this is a style i usually do not like but i found it very drinkable . overall i consider this above average for the style , but below average as an overall beer . it 's worth a try .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	pours with an excellent appearance , thick tan head with small dense bubbles and a clear hazelnut color . rich but mild malt aromas with some subtle hop aromas , fairly restrained aroma for a stone brew . rich mouthfeel full of biscuity bready chocolatly sweet flavors , sugary and chewy . has an astringent hop bitterness that lingers or it could be the alcohol that is in this . very drinkable and highly flavorful .

1.00 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80	thanks to dansteino for the excellent selection . poured into a pint glass . a : pours a clear golden color with two fingers of creamy white head that fades slowly , leaving countless strips of lacing on the glass . s : smells mildly skunked . beyond that there is a noticeable earthy , piney hop aroma . not much else . t : tastes very similar to smell . also , mildly skunked . pleasing hop character combines fairly nicely with very smooth malt . m : very good . smooth , not too bitter , good carbonation . slick , without being oily . d : beyond the skunk , i could probably put quite a few of these away . very nice .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.80	a- hazy reddish brown with ____ head that dissipates to a ring . a- amazing smelling , right after the pour this sweet fruity smell hit my nose . sweet fruity malt aroma with that wonderful belgian yeasty smell . this is another brew where i could just pour it and enjoy the aromas rather than even needing to drink it . t- initial malty sweetness followed by a spike of fruity sweetness . sortof cherry like , but not sour like other belgians with cherry flavors . very low bitterness , but a slight alcohol taste is noticeable . m- medium-light body which surprised me with how much flavor is stuffed into this brew . moderate-high carbonation with little to no carbonic bite . definite alcohol warming at 10 % . d- this is an amazing brew . i feel sad that i have n't tried any delirium up until this point . if youhave not yet tried this brew i definitely recommend that you do . the aroma alone is worth it . the taste is also incredible .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.90	has an okay color , but is not cloudy enough . i was hoping for something close to opaque , but it is just mildly cloudy . head formation and retention were not strong . has a nice blend of banana and cocoa powder over wheat . really would be nice if it were more potent . having heard that the sa hefe was rather poor , i was unsure how this would be , but i 'm impressed . pretty good hefe characteristics , with that extra layer of dark malty flavors , namely cocoa powder . has that nice chalky chocolate . some bready flavors , but spiciness is subdued . just a bit of clove . a twangy wheat note on there that maybe i would have liked smoothed out . pretty smooth . could use more yeast . in fact , it 's hard to tell if this was even bottle conditioned . i shook it out and assumed it was . still , rich and creamy . carbonation is just right . tastes good and feels smooth , and does not seem to be over 5.5 % abv or so . very easy to drink . i 'd buy a sixer of this over a lot of sa 's beers , and it 's easily the best thing in the harvest pack ( even if the mediocre appearance is going to knock the score down a bit ) . it 's hard to get a fresh dunkel , often . this is n't the truest one in the world , but it 's a good beer .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a slightly hazed pale straw with a fizzy one-finger head . poor retention and minimal lacing . pilsener malt and floral noble hop aroma , but timid overall . sweet dextrins and sharp pils malt attack the tounge upon first sip , followed by a lemon/citric hop tone and slight grassy taste . dry aftretaste , with balancing bitterness and mild floral hop notes coming through . semi-high carbonation and light in body , but has that decoction-mash dextrinous texture to boost the mouthfeel . finishes a bit tannic from the abundance of dextrin and dryness form the hops , but certainly enjoyable otherwise with lots of german hop notes and bavarian malt tones . i am reluctant to vote `` rave '' as the bottle says , but would also not vote `` to the grave '' .

1.00 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	a - black , inch and half of tawny head . leaves amazing lacing that should be in a museum as art . s - sweet caramel , coffee that is kind of light aroma though . t - chocolate , caramel , coffee m - creamy medium body that lingers . high carbonation . d - good . i was disappointed in this beer at first because the first one had a copper after taste , but the other five of the six pack tasted very good . being from indiana i am glad a few stores in my area carry this as a good fallback beer when i ca n't find anything new to try or i am in the mood for a good porter .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured from 22oz bottle into `` balloon '' glass the darkest ebony color in the body with a rocky massive foamy/sticky dark tan colored head . aroma is a bit roasted and obviously full of chocolate , but there was not much else going on . taste is just about the perfect balance of roasted malt for a typical stout flavor with a solid bitter-sweet chocolate presence . at first , its a sweet chocolate , but finishes more with a bitter dark chocolate flavor . mouthfeel is lighter than expected in the body , but very smooth and creamy . overall a top notch american stout . nothing fancy here , but a good balance of chocolate compared to some others and a price that ca n't be beat for a bomber .

0.60 1.00 0.90 1.00 0.90	i was unable to have this beer in a glass , so the appearance rating is average . beautiful scent from the start . the pumpkin is pleasantly strong . wow , what a great taste . spicy fermented pumpkin all the way . this just replaced post road pumpkin as my new favorite pumpkin beer . taste does not diminish near the end . mouthfeel is medium . quite easy to drink a few in one session . this is a terrific pumpkin offering ; one that any new englander should experience at least once .

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.80	i generally do n't like fruit beers but this is an exception . this is simply good wheat beer that happens to have apricot in it . the apricot taste is light and not obtrusive or cloying . it blends well with the tartness of the wheat . lightly hopped but no hop character evident . no head reterntion . a great summer beer with no beer snob appeal whatsoever .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.40	i like beers brewed with rye and love ipa 's , but this was a beer that i could n't stomach . left a very bad aftertaste and reminded me of a spoiled huma lupa , ( if there is such a thing ) . i would n't order another of these if you paid me . not sure if it was a bad batch , cause i really dig short 's beers .

0.20 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.20	disgusting . this is a lesson . do not buy beers in `` taste of the world '' packs . it 's a bunch of middlemen taking near-expired beers and tarting them up . the previous two beers from the pack expired sept 06 . this too ... . but this is misleading ... . it should have been thrown against the wall 3 months ago . pours out all sorts of particles . it 's not yeast sediment.. it 's large flaky bits of god knows what ... . the beer has had it ... just caramel notes , no hop ...

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.70	pours a hazy , pale yellow with a small head that quickly settles to a light ring of bubbles . very little if any lacing is left on the glass . smells grainy , slightly fruity , and just a bit of grassy hops . a drier experience then is typical of euro lagers . not a whole lot of flavors present but overall it has a neutral profile . finishes clean . light body with a somewhat harsh carbonation . surprising considering the lack of head . a nice example of a euro lager . not skunky or overly sweet . a low abv and light body helps this beer go down .

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	this one is a murky gold with an unbelievable meringue head billowing out of my duvel tulip . took ages for this beauty to collapse leaving behind some wicked lace and a cloudy castle floating atop the beer . even as i finished this one , there was an irregular clump of foam that looked something like a plastic bag that had been tossed into a bonfire and shrunk down . smells strongly of white pepper with a little lemon zest and ginger on the side . from the depths of its aroma comes a funky , earthy cedar . starts with a familiar triple creaminess with a smooth peppery yeast and creamy bread dough with a touch of anise , but , like the smell , a gentle sticky pine fades into being . the dynamics of the change up are really stellar . but , the hoppy dry finish is a little much as it is overly focused on just being bitter . feels light but firm with an easy , gentle carbonation . this is an interesting brew and hands-down beautiful , but a little dry in the finish for my liking .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	very nice looking bottle , 0.75 l. a : very thin head that quickly disappears , this beer looks and sounds like apple-cider , only with less carbonation . not very impressive . s : gives very clear caramel/sugar , citrus , grapes , hop and yeast . t : at first it 's allmost like having champagne , the hop and yeast try to balance the very sweet taste . m : it has got a rather evident alcohol taste , rather harsh , not to say unpleasant . d : this beer is ok , but nothing special ... if you 're looking for an adventure , you could get disappointed . a 0.75 l bottle is maybe too big , unless you share it.. i 'm not sure if you want to drink so much of this in one go . to my opinion the brewer has been far to easy trying to please with the caramel .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.40	reviewed on 6/28/08 . on ( nitro ) tap at sph . pours black with an inch thick light tan head that of course persists . aroma mostly of coffee and roasted malt , some light chocolate in there . flavor of the same sweet roasted malt , some bitter hops . weak palate , not very flavorful . ugh , did n't really care for this and i think the nitro made it worse . 6/4/6/2/12 ( 3.0/5 )

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	milwaukee 's best ice , if that ice was cut from an outhouse . it is best real cold , left outside all night on november night . i perfer it with little chunks of ice swimming in it . real bad beer , but a good way to get loaded .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.90	got this at my local grocery store , my dad is getting into homebrewing and needed some re-sealable bottles - just doing my part . note : i smoked a lot of tobacco today so my chemo receptors may be a little numb . appearance : clear ruby-brown , 2 finger soda-y head , nice retention and excellent lacing . aroma : caramel , grass , alcohol taste : just like the smell . caramel malt and generally grainy up front , pretty mellow taste , as to be expected from a lager . surprisingly watery given the great retention but nevertheless damn good . slight bitter hop finish and aftertaste . mouthfeel : smoothe , medium-heavy carbonation with a fairly dry finish . drinkability : substantial ( not sure what the abv is but i am feeling it , do n't eat this on an empty stomach )

0.40 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.70	let me preface this with saying that i absolutely love great lakes . however , this has been their most disappointing offering to date . went in to check out the pub exclusives and fill a growler or two . labeled with , `` strong hop presence , '' samples were poured from the tap . the taste was akin to miller , but with a more full flavor . a mild background of hops was present , but nothing that would qualify as strong . mouthfeel was smooth , light , though i do n't know i 'd go as far as crisp . scent was similar in that the floral hop smell was mildly there , but very hard to detect . generally , a weak ale smell . the beer was a very pale , watery yellow with a small white head that dissipated quickly . very clear , almost as a few drops of yellow food coloring had been added to a glass of water . it would be a pleasant brew after mowing the lawn on a hot day , but i 'd pass it up at the pub .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	brought back by my ex-pat wisconsin-michigan buddy who went back `` home '' to spend a week `` fishin ' at da cabbin '' with his packer-lovin ' family ( thanks jeff ! ) . pours kind of slightly cloudy pale yellow , not much to look at . a small head went to nothing in no time- and i do mean nothing . ok , i count 10 bubbles on the side of the glass . unimpressive . aroma , kind of sweet , and yes , milky . a faint beery-hoppiness that is very subtle , and somewhat pleasant . more than anything , the aroma reminds me of a warm , buttered english muffin . that is pretty cool . flavor is malty , sweet , with a nice hop balance . this a nice round , but not full , mouthfeel , and has very very high drinkability , very refreshing . this is not a sipper , this is for gulping down a bunch . good stuff . too bad it just is n't nicer to look at ! the real problem , though is my girlfriend stealing this from me while i 'm trying to review it !

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	appearance : golden yellow , poured with about three fingers of dense white foam . retention was excellent , left lots of lacing . lots of bubbles . smell : just the faintest whiff of sweetness as soon as i opened the can . taste : definitely can taste the corn adjunct . a little bitterness . similar to most mass-market aals . mouthfeel : a bit light in body . some metallic twang in the aftertaste . enough carbonation . overall : aside from the look in the glass , this does n't stand out in the world of bmc clones . not terrible , but not worth having again .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	another one i received courtesy of unclejedi that i had been waiting to try out . this weekend decided to pop it open and see what it was made of . the pour was jet black as night . with a thick look to it as it sludged into the glass . a very nice three finger high tan head of lace then rose up over the top and hung on forever . really thick looking with tons of side glass webs and a sticky presence to it . very nice look here . the aroma was very complex with a rich mix of malts and alcohol . the alcohol came across very clearly , and you had to let it warm to really be able to get the full depth of this one in . lots of dark baker 's chocolate , hints of vanilla and roasted coffee were mingling around in it . the flavor followed suit almost perfectly . the start was a nice rich chocolate and coffee like flavor that quickly became over run with unbalanced alcohol . a little harsh , but they can not all be blended well . the subtle flavors underneath did not begin to show themselves for a quite a little while later , with some nice touches of licorice , vanilla , and molasses starting to come through . this was a very sweet stout , just a little to hot right now . the finish was filled with a musty bitter bite that was kind of odd and ill placed , but there was not much you could do about it . a very full-bodied stout , there was certainly no lack of carbonation here , as it never felt as though it was flat in any way . i did polish off this bottle , however it was a little rough . this one clocked in at over 11 % and you felt every last drop of it . really a very big stout . overall , this was not bad at all , though there are certainly better examples of the style out there . on looks alone though , this one is awesome , i just think there were a little too much hops thrown in the finish and the alcohol was very distracting , not being as mellowed as i thought it would be . nevertheless , it was still a very solid beer , and if you have it around you , i would go out and try it .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	from tower liquor a - a deep reddish-copper pour , slightly hazy , with a great fluffy , off-white head with good retention and lacing . s - caramel , brown sugar , malts , slight breadiness and alcohol , with noticeable amounts of pine and grass . t - caramel , malts , toffee , pine , a hint of citrus , and light alcohol . m - very well-balanced . captures flavors of malts and pines , but distinguishes them . d - surprisingly good . clearly a good example of a west coast barley wine .

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	11.2 oz bottle poured into glass . poured very little head , less than 1/2 inch that disappeared almost instantly and left no lacing . smells of grassy malts and slightly skunky . very light and strangely smelled somewhat like crayons . taste was very watered down , similar to most american light beers but slightly better . grassy malts and slight skunkness became more pronounced halfway through glass . mouthfeel was extremely carbonated and watered down . overall drink ability was less than average but the lightness of the beer can be somewhat refreshing on an extremely hot texas day .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.50	pours a very clear copper . the off-white two finger head is dense and creamy , holds up extremely well and leaves patches of sticky lace . the aromas of american hops are strong ; citrus and grass with sweet malt and some fusels becoming more apparent as the head settles to a thin cap . apple and orange esters visciously smacks your tastebuds first , then mellows out to a soft dark wheat flavor . grassy hops then dominate the semi-dry aftertaste but never balance out the taste which is more overwhelmingly sweet than pleasently bitter . the body is medium and the tiny rushing carbonation tries to smooth the mouthfeel but the finish is almost more residual sweet than dry and bitter . still a decent brew , but i ca n't say the d.i.p.a . style was well represented .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.80	i 'm going to use this review to vent a little on lagunitas . so i started loving their beer . hoppy , juicy , higher abv in general . but then i realized they 're a bit of a one trick pony . put hop stoopid , sumpin sumpin , sumpin ' extra , undercover shutdown ale , brown shugga , imperial red , hairy eyeball , ( and others ) in a blind tasting against each other and good luck picking them out . you 'll likely end up with two categories : 1 ) hoppy with not much malt 2 ) hoppy with much malt not much else to distinguish their offerings to my palate . this beer is a bit lighter than typical for lagunitas . but not worth seeking out if you 've had their other similarly flavored offerings .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a nice copper color with a little off-whitehead that fizzles away after a couple of sips . the aroma is swet then bitter orange zest an then grapefruit taking over . but there is some soft caramel malt notes worth mentioning as well . not a bad balanced aroma . the taste starts off with a good citric bitterness that is at its peek in the front of the palate . the middle gives way to some of the biscuit and bread toasted malts to help balance out this dipa 's flavor . this also gives the beer a more resiny mothfeel . the finish is almost oily , but well balanced and warm from the alcohol content . this is teh best dipa i 've had out of idaho , thst for sure . and not bad compared to others for that matter .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.90	having sampled many of stones offerings in the past , im finally getting the chance to try their ipa . this is a 22 ounce bomber that im pouring into a goblet . the appearance is hazy , and it almost looks like there is some yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle . i didnt think that stone bottle conditioned but maybe im wrong . color is a deep golden yielding to copper . head is minimal but it has gorgeous lacing . not surprisingly , hops dominate the nose . this is an ipa , after all , and a west-coast style one , to boot . fruity citrus hops dominate , followed by floral and musty pine . in the background theres this wonderful hint of malt caramel sweetness . often you get an ipa with muted hop character , and thats certainly not the case here . the smell on this is just so crisp and fresh a sure sign that this is a very fresh ipa and one thats been treated with care . the first taste showcases a nice level of carbonation , and moderate bitterness that isnt overpowering . having had ruination in the past , its nice to get a beer from stone that actually attempts to maintain some semblance of balance . taste has a nice residual sweetness to it , including in the finish . its easy to finish ipas with bitterness , but this , surprisingly , seems to go more towards the sweet side . that said the body of the beer is light , dry , and refreshing . lots of flavor for something that goes down so easily . the label says 6.9 % abv but the alcohol is never apparent . stone gets a lot of praise for the other beers that they produce , but this is an underrated example of the west-coast ipa style . its a little bit light in body , but this lends to easy drinking . the hop profile and underrated malt backbone make this beer a winner .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.70	magnum sized bottle . pours a murky dark honey orange color with a very puffy 2 inch bone colored head that fades to a small cap . big globs of foam and rings around the glass on the drink down . smells of citrus zest hops , spices , and belgian yeast . taste is of citrus zest up front with some apple/grape juice , spices , and belgian yeast . there is a soapy bitter taste after each sip that does not taste very good . mouthfeel is a bit flat with a thick and creamy drink down . a bit too thick for the style in my opinion . overall , this is a decent beer that really does n't scream christmas at me other than maybe the spices . however , these spices are similar to wit beer spice tastes so i do n't know . interesting idea but not too impressed .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.90	750 ml bottle , a : pours a dark amber with a soft white head , average retention , no lace . s : orange peel , winter spice . t : christmas cookie notes with clear flavours of mace and cardamom . brown sugar abounds with elegant notes of orange in the finish . sweet feel overall , reminds me a ton of old fezziwig . m : full-bodied , long aftertaste of spice and malt . just a tad overcarbonated , but i 'm nitpicking . d : a great christmas belgian spiced beer . do n't know why i waited so long to try it , i love ommegang and i love christmas beers . a real treat .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured a slightly hazy copper . fluffy head features large bubbles quickly thins , leaving only a very thin top . the nose is full of hops , mostly of the floral variety . rich , caramel malts offer up a pleasant balance to the hops , particularly as it warms . mouthfeel is medium , with a nice malty backbone characteristic of any red ale or amber . the great difference here is the hop bitterness . indeed this could be considered a red pale ale or red ipa . bittering hops on the palate complement the floral aroma hops used in the dry-hopping . overall a very good beer for hopheads looking to enjoy something other than a full-on ipa . not overpowering on any front , with what i consider a quaffable abv .

0.30 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.90	a : corked and caged . the beer peers out from the bottle slightly reddish in color , which is somewhat surprising . after popping the cork , the beer overflowed and foamed ( with no end in sight ! ) until i was able to get some of it into a glass . * i 'm not all that familiar with french culture - maybe this is the brasserie la choulette 's idea of a gift . this bire de garde is a brownish amber , contrary to how it looked in the bottle . low clarity , and a huge , three-finger , rocky , sandstone head . after the head finally subsides , a thick layer of cream persists atop the beer . s : spicy and estery notes dominate , especially at warmer temperatures . the nose has a faint sweetness , that , when combined with the spiciness , give a distinct wildflower honey impression . there is also a funkiness emanating from the beer , a slight barnyard character . the esters are reminiscent of peaches and grapes . t : la choulette made a very well-balanced beer here . it 's much lighter and fruitier than the nose suggested , but slightly tart . it is just bitter enough to have an astringent `` dryness , '' but that counters the strong , sweet , caramel flavors from the crystal malts . there is also a saltiness and distinct earthiness/spiciness from the wild yeast . there is also a metallic , coppery taste like that found in chimay grand reserve . acetaldehyde also lingers , giving the apple-like tartness , and a character that resembles wine . high carbonation helps to offset some of the stronger and provides balance . i ca n't praise the effervescence too much , however , since the overcarbonation punished me upon uncorking . the flavor and degree of sourness remind me a bit of the duchesse , although i doubt they would be very similar if compared side-by-side , as the duchesse is a flanders red . m : creamy upfront , then slightly astringent , and a bit sticky like apple juice . d : high . if you 're in the mood for a slightly sour beer , this one is great . it 's extremely complex , and although it may be a bit heavy on the sweet malts , it delivers surprises with every sip . this farmhouse amber would be a low-mid a were it not for it 's rendition of mt . vesuvius on my countertop . however , because of a rough start , i docked the appearance to give this it 's b+ rating . * i should point out that i opened this one around 55 f , and that further chilling would have reduced , and possible prevented , the foaming .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	i have been disappointed by saranac products before . i 'd say the pale is disppointing , but only in one factor , and overall , it 's a better offering from this brewery than i am used to . a very nice looking sample . rich copper color with long-lasting off-white head . stellar lacing . `` fruity hop bouquet '' referred to on label is only marginally apparent , even as sample warmed ( which it did as i screamed more at chris collinsworth 's marginally useful comments than drink my ale during the super bowl . yes , i rate beer during the super bowl . sosumi . ) there is an interesting , slightly peppery quality that sets the flavor apart ( and not necessarily above ) from a standard good ol ' pale ale . a bit average in taste otherwise . for every nice flavor note , there 's a blandness to the mouthfeel . conflicted : wanted to like it more , so i do n't seem a saranac-slagger ...

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.40 0.40	unfiltered draft sampler at kraftbrau . im a fraid this one struck an off note with me . the malt taste here was more burnt than anything else at first impression . that taste mitigates after a while , leaving a more pleasant nose of dark coffee . in other words , a lagered stout . the waitress said it may be off because the batch was just tapped the day i can in .

0.30 0.20 0.60 0.40 0.40	first off , let me explain how i cam across this bottle . i used to drink 40 's of this stuff when i was like 15 . they cost about 89 cents a bottle . i thought i was cool . now , 9 years later , i have a slightly different apreciation for beer . i told some friends of mine that i used to drink this stuff , and they thought that was very funny . the other day , i threw a party , and one of my friends bought me a 40 to be funny . i decided to review it for old times sake . so here goes . this beer pours a very light straw colored yellow . it looks like water with a little food coloring to it . the head is white and lifeless . it fades very quick leaving no laces . the first thing i think of when i smell this stuff is rotting sewage . it smells like rotton corn and dirty water . i dont smell any hops . i dont smell any redeaming qualities at all . i am slightly scared to taste this stuff again . first taste isnt too bad . not good by any means , but not as bad as i expected . it has a corn flavor . i guess that would be because it is made with corn . it is not hoppy at all . i detect absolutely no spicy flavor . also , i cant taste any malty flavors . it tastes very much like everything that anheuser-busch makes . this beer is carbonated decently , i guess . it would , in my opinion , make an awfull session beer . i will probably never drink it again . it is low in alcohol , though , so to those that like anheuser-busch products , it might be a good session beer . i know i used to drink 4 or 5 40 's in a night , much to my regrets in the morning . i would recomend staying away from this one . stick to urine . it probably tastes better .

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	overly active bottle as it is a gusher right from the bottle cap opening . even gentle pours result in large frothy beige head of several cm . bottle is notched best before july 06 . ooops . didnt realize it was in my cellar that long . we 'll see how this goes . the beer is a deep mahogany color with some particulates floating . the aroma seems ok with no obvious infection scents so i will press on . some caramel and some toffee with hints of cocoa powder as well . first sip reveals a lite yet silky smooth body with mild carbonation . flavor is similar to nose advertising , lots of malt but not overly powerful . i get some chocolate and brown sugar with toffee too . a little bit of harsh burnt flavor , could have just averted severe problems with the beer . there is no real hop presence and abv is buried too . i think i could drink lots of this beer and not be bored or hammered . a decent brown ale . i hurt the appearance due to gusher action .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	sampled at the harmon brewery . this one was a little clearer than the pinnacle peak pale but still had some haziness to go along with a darker orange color . it has mild bitterness with some citrus/grapefruit and a little spice , with a mild malty finish .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60	had at the bucco game . not a bad beer , pretty refreshing . the look and smell are n't all that appealing . could be a bit more berry tasting . a bit watery . nice carbonation level though . i am sure someone will like this , but it is n't my thing . i really like fruit beer , but this is a bit weak , but not bad .

0.90 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.60	appearance : this brew pours with a wonderfully thick head . sustain is excellent . lacings are plentiful and surface spiderwebbing is consistant and lasting . color is indeed a reddish amber . excellent first impression . smell : aroma is thin with euro pale lager as the predominant amell . this is interesting considering this is supposed to be an ale . malt is thin as is hops . not to good here . taste : well ... .i have to admit ... this does taste like a strong version of heinekin . i would rate this as a strong euro pale . taste curve is fairly sharp during onset . sustain is rather long even if it is tapered . hops strong during onset . citrus is typical heinekin , but a little stronger . sustain is a sloppy aftertaste . not well designed recipe . mouthfeel : i do n't have much to say here . this is literally a strong yet poor quality heinekin . additionally all the aftertaste follows this same design . not impressed . drinkability : again , little comment . heavy presence ( hops and aftertaste ) make this a mildly palatable drink that sits heavy on the stomache . unfortunately there is no sugar or spice presence to offset this heaviness . average and forgetable . prosit ! nikki

0.20 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.30	visited home for july 4th and tried out the local brewery , sampled the lager in a english pint glass off tap at a tavern : a- golden pale yellow in color , very cloudy in appearance , s- light watermelon smell t- you can definately taste the watermelon , has a sweet taste in the pallet yet a sour after taste in the end m- very thin , hardly any body at all , low carbonation d- personally i found this lager hard to drink in excess

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	great dipa , a bit mono-chord ... but it sure hits that note so well . presentation : 750 ml brown corked bottle . simple and almost corporate design of the name over a green and black pattern . very poor and lazy design with 3ded fonts . notes unfiltered nature alongside a short one liner noting style . lacks any bottling or best by date . shows alc . by vol . ( 9 % ) . served in a tulip glass . a - deep amber to amber brown orange pour . extraordinary head towering above the glass , great retention , surface memory , and frothy lacing . s - very rich and fresh hoppy nose : grapefruit , pineapple , with a grassy and resinous feel . t - rich hoppiness , very assertive but not overtly aggressive . resinous hops , fruity notes with a peppery and somewhat boozy finish . there is a nice malty backbone with some caramel hidden under the hops . m - medium body with a sticky and creamy feel with a pungent dry bitterness that seals the brew nicely . d - truly nice , it has a hoppy and bitter smoothness that is quite special . notes : it had been a bit of a while since i had this one and remains great . both filtered and unfiltered versions are a delight . bottle presentation sure is its biggest flaw . it needs an aesthetic overhaul big time , luckily the brew is quality because its presence before one opens the bottle is pretty pathetic , in line with most weyerbacher designs although they sure do worse presentations than this one .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	very nice color when pouring it from the bottle to my mug . small carmel colored head . the nose was n't as strong as i was epecting , but coffee was out front . nice taste , can really taste chocolate and coffee , but was lighter than i expected , but may be due to drinking many bourbon barrel aged stouts the last few nights . this had a little more carbonation than the stouts that i am used to from a strong stout . i can really catch the hops on the finish and the aftertaste lingers nicely of coffee . this was my only bottle and i do look forward to getting more of it .

0.90 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	nice oil-can packaging . pours nicely to an amber color with good head . nice . nose has some grains and cooked vegetable , perhaps cabbage . tingly herbal hops mingle with sweet grain flavors on the palate . some fruity flavors too . wish i had left beer in can so it would feel cooler drinking this .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	picked this one up at the coffee grounds , it is their official beer brewed with their own coffee by sand creek . pours a dark brown bordering on black with a creamy white/tan head that does n't leave any lacing as it recedes . this one has that coffeehouse scent , more so than a lot of coffee beers . the smell is predominantly coffee . the flavor is also heavy on coffee , it has the classic oatmeal stout mouthfeel as well . there is also some chocolate and sugar thrown in the mix for good measure . it was a surprisingly good beer .

0.90 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.40	12oz bottle into a goblet a : pours a clear amber color with a finger of white head . solid looking beer . s : lots do spices - cinnamon , clove , and nutmeg , with a good amount of apple cider aroma . t : sweetness in the way of ripe apples and brown sugar . spices support the sweetness , but are much less prominent than they were in the aroma . very straight forward , though . i do n't get any sort of belgian yeast flavor , and everything is pretty mild . the spices really are n't working well together - they create an odd , bitter flavor . m : thin , well carbonated . i wish this had more body to it . o : i like the idea of this beer , but not so much the execution . the mouthfeel is thin , the flavors are mild , and there is not much complexity .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.80	tasted nov. 21rst 2011 ( from notes ) tulip a - very nice translucent blood red , 1/4 finger off white fizzy head and minimum lacing s - peat , smoke , nuts , alcohol , slight wine , lots of yeast and oak t - so much peat , wow ! sap , wood , lemon , citrus , alcohol , sauvignon blanc , more peat , some nice hops and the peat kind of peats ( haha ) out all the other flavors m - medium body , medium acidity , low complexity , not balanced and very long finish d - while at first few sips the peat is overwhelming and almost nasty , after a bit the peat is more in the background of a smokey , citrus , alcoholic ale . i think i would like it and score it higher if there was more flavors than the peat . other than that , it 's nice final thought - $ 11 and 15 % with to much peat , i 'd pass or ate this one to see how the peat mellows later on

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	12 oz bottle cellared for about 16 months , poured into my delirium snifter . immort ale is a dark garnet with a large , fluffy light tan head that leaves heavy foamy lace . pretty impressive for what i 'm reviewing as a wee-heavy . smell is pretty mild really , some light maltiness , but mainly just smoke , with some sweet alcohol vapors coming through as it warms from the cellar serving temp . taste is sharply phenolic peat , some maple like sweetness . no much alcohol character save for the dry sweentess , but just kind of simple , a strong smokey beer . mouthfeel is pretty smooth carbonation , medium heavy body , sticky and tannic . drinkability is ok , the peat was to sharp at first but i adjusted and enjoyed it more . still not really my bag . i do n't recall but i may have another one , will probably forget about it .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	clear golden color with a slim head that quickly disappeared to a few spotts of bubbles on the surface of the beer . some spotty lacing is left on the glass . interesting aroma at least . pale malt and honey . do not know if this is brewed with honey or not but there is a floral sweetness . no hops . the flavor is quite poor for an apa but it would be an average blond ale . a bit sweet with some pale malt flavor . again no hops or bitterness . light body and low carbonation . maybe a little too low . has a little bit of a slick feel . not bad for a light beer but if you are looking for a hoppy apa , you will be very disappointed . usually can be found on sale so it makes drinking this beer a little easier to drink .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.40 0.60	i despise this brew for brainwashing my fellow americans into thinking that this sort of thing is beer . it does n't have a smell or taste . i can only thank this beer for making me truly appreciate brews of substance and character . it is one of the most popular beers in the world . i dont really know how to explain this . good marketing ? if you dont care what you drink , you might give this a go when you are n't forced at gunpoint .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	this brew has a very strong roasted chocolaty aroma . the initial pour formed a small head of small dark brown bubbles . as the head died , it left a clinging vine lacing stubbornly letting go of the side of the glass . its body is dark as midnight although some carbonation could be seen rising up the side of the glass . i eagerly await my initial taste . all of the stout ingredients are there in the taste , coffee , chocolate and roasted flavors greet my mouth as the first taste goes down and leaves a pleasant impression . relatively smooth i thought and a bit more than i expected for a potentially good stout . no carbonation in the taste at all , no strong after bite and surprisingly smooth for a dark stout . a stout i can drink more of in a night and that says a lot right there .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.90	it has arrived ! an irish stout i 've been waiting to try for a very long time . 330 ml bottle consumed at a certain way , on to the beer : it 's black with a some hues of ruby red . the head formed on top is extremly thick , is tanned in color , and still holds on top until the last sip . did i mention is shows some rings of lacing ? a little coffee , husky malt and faint chocolate in the aroma . also a light hop bite . light , but pleasant . semi-sweet chocolate is present through . so is baker 's chocolate . it 's chocolate heaven ! the aftertaste is on the dry side with a little roasted goodness . light , but smooth in the mouth . goes down really easy . it may not come in one of those cool nitr-cans , but it 's an irish stout that can hold its own against the others . it worked well with the mac & cheese + andouille i made .

1.00 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60	batch # 45 . named after fred eckhardt , and brewed with 10 different hop varieties and aromatic and rye malts . clear copper with orange accents , forming a large , pillowy peaking light beige head atop fine bubbles . moderately strong carbonation . aroma is of fresh varietal hops , a hint of grass , vanilla , alcohol , and sugary pale malts . taste is spicy , flowery hops , sticky abundant pale malts , a bite of alcohol with a peppery , astringent finish . moderately-strong floral bitter finish . complex , yet not very balanced . rich in body . mouthfeel is initially bright with a ruddiness 1/2 way through . the pronounced alcohol flavor tends to ruin this one .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	had this bad boy on tap multiple times out da kegerator . if you pour it good you can get absolutely no head on it , looks like apple juice when you do . smells just like a an average macro brew , nothing specific jumps out . has a weird , almost corn taste that i do n't normally detect out of the bottle . i 'd say i prefer to drink this out of the bottle than the keg , i have no clue why it just tastes better to me . overall- do n't buy just get a real beer .

0.30 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	thanks to steve for this one . a rarity that i never thought i 'd come across . kind of like dave-lite here . unlabeled 12oz . bottle poured into a hill farmstead tulip . beer is sludgy and opaque brown . great legs but no head or lacing . looks like murky swamp water . nose is caramel , brown sugar , cocoa , toffee , and some sdweet soy sauce . very sugary . aromatic and robust with deep , full flavors . incredible rich . very sweet . caramel , brown sugar , and a sweet , hop creaminess . sweet soy sauce towards the middle mixed with toffee and more caramel . finish is slightly grainy brown sugar . aftertaste of toffee . a bit oxidized as its cardboard-y towards the end . but still , the complexity is there and like the aroma , very rich . medium to full bodied with very low carbonation . filmy , viscous and heavy in the mouth and rich and thick going down . finishes deep with a filmy aftertaste . appropriate for the style . this is still a very solid beer but i feel as if its been on the downhill for a little while now . still very rich and complex but the flavors are starting to muddle together a bit . really glad to have had the chance to try this one .

0.80 0.30 0.70 0.30 0.30	thanks to jeff m. for sharing two '94 's at the hb club meeting last night . from notes . black as the end of the universe with slight bubbling on top that may have been the fossils of extinct carbonation . has a pretty nice look actually . rotted maple syrup and soy marinated pork are the main aromas , with some cardboard and burnt rubber in there too . super strong taste , less maple but all the aromas come to life like the living dead in this evil drink . i was craving some muu-shuu to dip in it . thick as quicksand , a finish that is horrific , no carb. , and a resinous cling in mouth that may require surgery to remove . not the worst beverage i have ever tried , only because i have consumed my share of aguardiente de cana in my day . this beer is a must miss .

1.00 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	12oz . bottle poured into an imperial pint . best by 10-06-10 . this is literally the freshest bottle i found in almost 3 states of the midwest , so i am rating this since i can not find anything fresher in all the stores i have visited . ( a ) - pours a clear golden yellow/orange color that produced a huge foamy/fluffy white head with great retention . tons of lacing left behind as it very slowly dissipated . ( s ) - a huge burst of pine-like citrus with some lemon and lime fruits . slightly dry , but otherwise the piney hops take center stage . ( t ) - a dry pine-like wood profile up front . some minimal lemon and lime citrus behind that . very subtle honey-like sweetness . ( m ) - a good carbonation level . a decent balance , but it really is primarily a very dry bitter pine profile of a beer . ( d ) - i can see how this can be a good ipa , but it would be nice to see how it is fresh since i am unable to find it as such in either il or wi where i have gone .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	from notes . i still remember the first time i found this one , on tap at humpys , and being quite smitten with it . now 't is fairly easily obtainable in bottles ... pours amber/bronze , very active with huge frothy white head , great retention and lacing . amazingly attractive . smell is pleasant but not bold . citrus and spicy hop aroma , with some barely perceptible malt presence . was hoping for more . taste malty sweetness prominent up front but is balanced well and consistently by a moderately aggressive hop presence . hops impart some piny flavors and a bitterness that increases and grows dominant in the finish , then lingers . feel medium body , rich smooth texture , some slight dryness and lingering mild bitterness . overall fairly balanced , very smooth . deep hoppy flavor with solid malty backing more this one more than worth a try . a toned down yet close relative of the west coast ipa & gt ;

0.40 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	a 750 ml brown bottle ( pretty label ) , poured to a pint glass . it 's the first day of winter and portland is locked in , as dubbed by the media , an 'arctic blast ' . temps in the 20 's , nearly a foot of the white stuff on the ground and more on the way . ( pointless ) snow shoveling completed , seems a perfect time for a warming pumpkin ale . a : color is nice : an autumnal chestnut/orange-brown , a faint haze . where 's the carbonation ? a few frothy soap bubbles form a sloppy ring , fading quickly to pencil-thin whitish ring . no visible bubbles - looks kinda sad and lifeless but for a cheery color . s : pleasant sweetness : a nose full of nuttiness , pumpkin spices ( allspice , nutmeg ) , dark raisins . sugary sweetness is n't a bad thing when it smells so much like a pumpkin pie , complete with a flaky and buttery crust . t : pumpkin pie spice and a slight dark fruit tartness ( belgian yeast ? ) . a molasses/maple sweetness , though neither are very discernible . baked apple pie ? something in the finish reminds me of a spicy/syrupy belgian tripel : slightly tart , a bit fruity ( grapes , apples , pears ) . drying bitterness in the finish : a more earthy pungency , like a sprinkling of nutmeg or a shaved cinnamon stick . definitely holds my attention . m : where to begin ? syrupy viscosity going down , then a sticky , almost gummy starchiness . flat ( lack of ) carbonation makes for a thinner feel , even from a 'heavy ' ale . alcohol warmth is pretty apparent . d : i expected to really like this , as i 'm a big fan of the 'pumpkin ale ' . read the label : 'belgian-style brown ale brewed with yams , molasses , maple syrup and spices ' . sounds great ; execution just did n't work for me . finished the bottle over a couple hours , but probably would not buy again . ps : the very faint hiss when uncapping and the generally flat appearance/feel leads me to suspect an issue on the bottling line . purchased only a couple weeks ago , a fall seasonal certainly within the time frame of freshness . worth noting that this ale seemed anything but 'fresh ' from the bottle .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.40 0.50	this is busch light nothing else needs to be said appearence - straw yellow . little lacing . quickly disappearing head into slick smell - i smell corn and alcohol taste - it is like beer flavored water . nothing that is appealing . mouthfeel -n/a haha yeah there is nothing but a little fizz drinkability - this is slam them down while on the boat fishing beer . that is the only good thing about this beer . overall : meh that is all i can say . it is by far the worst beer i have reiviewed . but if we want to stock our cooler to go fishing these are always in there . because it is cheap , drinkable , and effective

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.80	bottle : poured a deep opaque brown color ale with a huge dirty white color foamy head with good retention and some lacing . aroma is comprised of candi sugar and doughy yeast with maybe some subtle note of maple syrup . taste is a mix between candi sugar , doughy yeast some dry fruits and subtle maple syrup . body is full with some great carbonation and no alcohol was detectable . i must admit that i enjoyed that one even though the maple syrup was not overly dominant .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.60	poured a light clear golden color , with a small head with big bubbles that mostly dissipated quickly . has a honey aroma with floral hints . the initial taste was of honey with some citrous on the side . i normally expect a blonde ale to be pretty bland , but this had more flavor than most .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.70	poured from a brown 12 oz . bottle . has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head . smell is of malts , a touch sweet . taste is crisp , very refreshing , a bit of sweetness with a tad bit of bitterness at the finish . feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60 0.70	unpasteurized so must refrigerate . an ok beer . appearance would be enhanced with labels staying on bottle , but pale clear color ok.. still high on carbonation . a bit malty but otherwise no memorable taste . better than national brands but not by much .

0.90 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.70	like the nitro can version , the nitro-bottle of guinness draught does a great job simulating the pub pour of draft guinness . great theatre watching the tall head overtaken by the liquid and the color is near black and near opaque . smell is mild-mannered to not there at all . mosty sharp-sour taste at first and creaminess and malts kick it after , but the aftertaste was bordering on `` huh '' ? smooth , medium body mouthfeel and low carbonation . this is more typical , for me of a draft guinness that the nitro-can i recently reviewed . i have to raise the drinkability score a bit , b/c of the mouthfeel . i still think guinness fans might be better off with a fresh draft pour or the bottled `` extra stout ''

0.90 0.80 0.30 0.70 0.50	a - absurdly large head - tons of lacing all which sits above a golden brew . s - fragrant floral hops ( lillies ) . a tiny bit of malt underneath - but nothing else . the floral aroma is pleasant and strong . t - floral hops with a bit of light malt and very faint licorice . aftertaste is a dry hay flavor with a touch of lingering lillies . m - drying , medium bodied , carbonation is a bit harsh . d - okay . i actually prefer the apa . this is a bit too dry for my liking . i like thirst quenching to be a property of my ipas .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	strong aroma and subdued taste with a rich , dark color . this was served colder than i expected it to be but i was impressed with the balanced flavor . maybe now that the allowable alcohol content in ohio has been raised they can make this more imperial .

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.40 0.50	poured from a stopper-capped ceramic bottle - the best looking bottle i 've ever come across , btw - into a tulip glass . cloudy orange-amber , thick , tan head , lovely lacing . perfect looking . aroma is highly hopped with sweet malt backbone . hops tend towards the pine-y side . can smell the alcohol too . taste : [ insert needle ripping across vinly lp ] damn ! what 's gone wrong ? bitter ( and not the hops kind of bitter ) with a horrible burning plastic aftertaste . astringent . bleh . despite the tase , it felt pretty good in the mouth . burns going down , though.not an unpleasant burn , more a spicy burn , but a burn nevertheless . drinkability - the taste and $ $ $ conspire to make it a 2.5 . man , i hope something was wrong with this one . it looked and smelled incredible . the taste went off the rails , tho . you 'd think that if something was bad pre se with the bottle , you 'd be able to tell early on . not here . this one puzzles me to no end . bottom line : big -no , horrible - disappointment . that said , i 'll try it again , just to see if it was an isolated event . rogue 's always come through for me in the past ; this one deserves a second try .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	12oz . brown bottle , poured into an ipa tulip , enjoyed at the legendary maproom . a : muted , but pretty , apricot pour , very cloudy . 1 finger head , decent retention . prefect lacing . thick , sticky , blankety , rings , everything ... just as good as furious ' . s : nice citrus with big pineapple overtones . sweet malts with caramel notes . t/m : good bitterness level . nice citrus with lots of dry pine and pepper . malts are sweet and just balancing . medium body with some umph and decent carbonation . d : easy drinking and inviting .

0.30 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.60	not much to this- a typical thin bodied , slightly grainy and watery carribean beer with little real nose or flavor , except for the lime squeezed into it . however , i was drinking this at a little outside bar in ocho rios last week , while enjoying a nice cigar . this no doubt affected my perception of this beer somewhat ... .how could anything be too bad at that point ?

1.00 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	ok , so i sampled this brew in atlanta at the hartsfield-jackson airport in concourse d. found it at a phillips seafood restaurant location , which is based in annapolis , maryland . this is also hometown to the clipper city brewery who brews this beer for phillips seafood . in atlanta . and it 's not really an amber as much as it 's a re-branded clipper city pale ale . get all that ? you will be tested . so was this beer . poured off the tap a with creamy tan head composed of tiny bubbles . nice retention and very good lacing . clear amber color makes this an all around great looking brew . pleasant light hop aroma with some malt there too . the flavors were at first hoppy , then some smooth malts come in and lead to a finish that is again hopped and crisp . the hops take center stage as it warms up ( clearly it was an american pale ale at heart ) . medium body and a decent mouthfeel but a little on the watery side . still , for a pale ale this is worth checking out .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.80	pours a glorious deep , garnet-tinged amber color , with a thick , creamy , sticky , cream-colored head on top . the aroma primarily features a yeasty earthiness , but there is also a dull , musty hop presence and a bit of brown sugar sweetness . the flavor is satisfying but muddled , with a primary characteristic of caramelized bananas , along with a bid of earthiness and a faint sugary sweetness . the micro-fine carbonation is a bit prickly , but the overall texture is actually quite creamy . overall , this beer ca n't quite stand up to the depth and complexity of the heavyweights of the style , but it is still a smooth and flavorful dubbel that i thoroughly enjoyed .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.70	presentation : 12 oz . bottle with an overly holiday red label . tan oval in the center of the label with a `` troegs '' banner across the middle . `` the mad elf '' on the top of the oval with `` holiday ale , ale brewed with honey & cherries '' on the bottom . there 's this crazy lookin ' elf spillin ' a goblet of troegs ' holiday ale over the bannner in the center . cherries are all over the rest of the label . `` hand crafted by two brothers '' . 11 % abv displayed , but no freshness date . appearance : pours a beautiful clear scarlet red with bright kool-aid red highlights in a tulip glass . head was a half inch off white , but dropped to a ring around the glass fairly quickly . lotsa bubbles . color is beautiful . smell : aroma is sweet with malted grains and a hint of fruit . you can detect cherries , but only if you read the label . alcohol aromas as well . taste : mild in the flavor department . malty sweet with a wash of cherry . grainy with some spiciness and a touch of ambrosia . hop character is mild at best with almost no bitterness . only real bitterness is from yeast in the finish . alcohol is evident and warming but not overwhelming . finishes sweet with alcohol spiciness . mouthfeel : very little carbonation . light-medium body that rolls around and swallows well . a little disappointing , though . drinkability : very drinkable . there 's not much to stop you here . alcohol is there but well masked at first . mouthfeel makes this is drinkable as the kool-aid it looks like . after a while the alcohol kicks in and is intoxicating and warming , so be careful . overall : hmmm ... this is just an average belgian strong dark . mildly flavorful with cherry and alcohol flavors taking center stage . dangerously drinkable , but the mouthfeel is lacking . if you want an easy to drink , intoxicating , belgian with just a hint of belgian spices and phenols and splashes of cherry , then oddly , this is your brew . otherwise , just average .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	i 've enjoind mendocino 's beers in the past , and was very interested in this stout , which i had never had before . it poured a very dark brown , and is black in the glass , with no highlights . the head is disappointing . very thin , tan , and does n't last at all . the aroma is good , roasted espresso , and some hops . there is also a smokey aroma masking some sweetness . the flavor is full of hop bitterness , and the malt is underplayed . there is some alcohol , but not much . the mouthfeel is clean . there is a slightly bitter aftertaste , but it does n't linger . overall , a good american stout . it might not be as good as i expected , but i would have it again .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70	growler that was part of a haul provided by mister `` it ai n't no thang '' himself , mr. beerworld . five hours each way ? ! what a trooper ! : d poured into my ommegang anniversary glass ( the more recent regal-looking one ) . a gritty caramelized-orange color , a little haze . nearly an inch of blank white head after some time settling in the fridge . root-like lace working its way down . we 're good to go . : ) smells of macerated whole wheat , white pepper , a sure amount of clove , & a floral amount of unripened , semi sweet/bitter cantaloupe . a touch of sugar on the end . taste is very bready . alcohol becomes very familiar over time . carbonation is sturdy , but without being over-insistive . more forceful clove , somewhat `` oat-ish '' ( taste , not feel ) , noticeable butter , mildly grassy hops , all residing in a greasy finish . even cold , it is obviously ... quite slippery . filling in a sense , though the bitterness wets the appetite a touch . the growler is gone , & so is my ability to operate heavy machinery . i hear portsmouth is very wallet-friendly , so drink up . the spell check saw heavy use in this review . : o

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.90 0.90	750ml bottle ( with the best label art ever , and not just the boob - although i am a fan of that as well ) into a mini-nonic . a : cloudy bright amber-gold body with a thin , late developing head that leaves as soon as it arrives . definitely a bit on the flat side for a saison . s : moderately funky and tart , with mango , white grape , and rose petals . fascinating , delicate , and great . t : starts out tart , then the cherry finally shows up with distinct sweetness . the floral notes are there as well , and help give just a bit of crispness to the finish . a little too sweet for my tastes , but unique and memorable . m : fairly light body with low carbonation . not bad , but definitely less bubbly than i 'd like . d : goes down very easily , with enough tartness to balance out the fruit sweetness - almost . notes : thanks , matt , for sharing this beauty . while it would be hard for any beer to measure up to this one 's label , the contents of four play do n't feel like an afterthought at all . this is one of the most delicately complicated beers i 've encountered , and with more carbonation ( and maybe just a bit more sourness ) it would go from excellent to phenomenal . cheers !

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	notch on the side of the label indicates this is fresh until may 2007 . dark brown in color and the tan head retains its character well . smells somewhat like a variety of steaksauce with a latent sweetness . the body is somewhere between medium and full , which the fullnees is probally due to the 190 calories per 12floz . ( if i 'm correct ) . creamy as advertised , whereas the roastiness is minimized by lactose qualities . not really my thing , but its okay . sits a bit heavy , milk stout aficionados may enjoy this though .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.50	appearance - poor without much head or carbonation . faint yellow color , looks typical . smell - the predoimant smell is those of hops , very clean smell , yet faint for the most part . definetely above average . taste - good pilsner taste at the right amount . slightly sweet , not bitter at all . leaves a very slight soapy aftertaste , that would hurt the beers drinkability . very soothing to the mouth . i suppose the taste could wear off if you 're chugging this . drinkability - drinkable for a 6-pack , however there are many other more flavorful beers that i find more appealing . would probably wear on me eventually though .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 1.00	a.. can not really say since i drank it from the can . i heard such great things about this beer that i figured i should enjoy my first from the can . s..smells like it belongs in a bottle . nice hops scent ; not overpowering . t..this was very tasty , especially considering it 's presented in a an aluminum can . hops are there obviously , but not nearly as strong as i had thought . the malt definitely takes a back seat to the hops , but i felt there was a good equilibrium between the two . m..light bodied . smooth ; very good for the summer . d..easy to drink , especially if it 's warm outside . best canned beer i have ever had ( the rumors were true ) . recommended if you want a stronger pale ale for a backyard cook out , or a few beers doing house work . i hope to have again soon .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60	pours a clear , straw color . 7/4 inch head of a white color . great retention and great lacing . smells of pale malt , grain , slight hops , hint of sweet malt , and a sulfur aroma . fits the style of an euro pale lager . mouth feel is sharp and crisp , with an average carbonation level . tastes of pale malt , hint of sweet malt , slight hops , hint of sweet malt , and slight sulfur . overall , good appearance and everything else is tainted by the sulfur aroma and taste .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	clear gold and looks a bit like a bog standard pale larger . wheat beer nose but somewhat more subdued than the hefenweizen . palate confirms with a flavour profile that seems slightly dilute ( again when compared to the stablemate ) but still a handy drop .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured from tap at the brewery . probably their best brew . appearance is rather uninspiring , dark , little to no lace or head , no apparent carbonation . the aromatics are quite lovely , lots of toasted , roasted malts , dark fruits , and a faint hint of smoked peat ( reminds me of some of the aromas i get from a good highlands scotch ) . rich and full on the palate yet balanced on the finish . very good effort here . i bought a growler to take , though it was even less carbonated after the hour and a half ride back to portland !

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured this puppy into a duvel tulip , which helped to bring about an ample 4 finger thick fluffy and off white head . the body is very murky and peach in color . head retention is great , as well as the lacing . aroma 's husky and hay , along with some fruity and sour notes . the taste is surprisingly hoppier than expected : a hint of grass and slight spruce with zero funk . feels a bit coarse and sandy , dry but not too much alcohol detected in the feel . this is a great and crisp ale , but the funky aroma does n't go along with the taste , which was a good thing .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	pours a cloudy honey amber with quickly dissipating off-white head . aroma of cherries ? ! ? and potpourri like spices . a light earthy hop note detected . somewhat of a mess of ginger , sweetness , nutmeg , toffee , sweetness , clove , and sweetness . bitterness is moderate , but the beer finishes incredibly cloying . medium-full in body with smooth moderate carbonation . alcohol warmth is considerably low for the abv , a plus . the spice joined with the cloying sweetness dominates the palate . if the unfermentable sugars and spice additions were cut back , this could be a nice beer in my opinion . i have a hard time believing the abv , but if it is true , it is very well hidden ... maybe behind that extra ginger they threw in .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.50	a - the bottle is definitely cool . it got me interested in the beer in the first place . poured a soapy two finger head . head quickly disappeared and left some nice lacing . nice hazy amber color . i was expecting something darker and more stoutish like other coffee porters . kinda nice for a change . s - day old coffee . the kind you like to drink after a long night of drinking . hints of vanilla and booze . t - roasted coffee . just like drinking an iced coffee . this beer even has a sweet finish , kind of how i like to sweeten my coffee . the finish on this beer leaves me with roasted malts as well . m - this is probably my least favorite feature of this beer . the beer has no body . its wet and carbonated , but not in a nice way for me . kinda like drinking a new castle ( dont really care for them ) d - this is different from all the coffee porters that exist and i commend meantime for making a truly different beer . its not bad tasting , but i cant get past the lack of body . comparing this to others in its category , it falls flat for me . i dont think i would consider this first when choosing a beer .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	a : odd carbonation . not very beer like . more like a sparkling apple juice . color is a somewhat dull gold . no head . s : bready/ricey malt . definitely ricey . slightly vinegary . t/m : a sturdy sting of carbonation on the tongue . refreshing but not particularly flavorful . oddly enough , i must say that i like it , despite it not being interesting . although extremely mild , the flavor is nice . if other water beers tasted like this , i would be much more enthusiastic about drinking them . nothing offensive about it . almost like tea . o : excellent water beer . i wish this was commonly available here , very easy to drink with dinner or whenever .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	caged and corked 75cl bottle ; poured with an immense head of tight foam and a beautiful tornadic swirl of yeast-inspired carbonation . when an aroma can finally escape , it is slightly spicy and tart , not unlike a freshly peeled blood orange . the flavor , however , is much more full-bodied . this is very earthy with a brown-sugary base , and a viscuous flowery aspect . i enjoyed it quite much . ( # 2798 , 4/15/2007 )

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.90	this beer was tasted from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass . th beer pours an orange-amber color with an off white one finger head that dissipates to practically nothing leaving no lace . the aroma is a bit buttery along with bready malts and slightly floral hops . the taste is up front up front with caramel and bready malts . this is followed by a bit of butteriness and hop bitterness . there is a bit of floral hops in there too . caramel and fruitiness make this one really nice . the beer displays a medium body along with very subtle and smooth carbonation . overall , a very nice easy drinking ale . i probably wont grab it first as i often fall prey to highly hopped and high alcohol beers . i must make a point to go for this one more often and it is quite nice .

0.50 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.80	pours amber/light copper with a light tan head that drops off pronto . no head retention/lacing smell : alcohol , malt , slight spicyness ( cinamon ) and slighter smokiness taste : maltiness dances with a slight alcohol tinged frutiness/spicyness . more nutty/toasty notes come through as the beer warms . mf : chewy and moreish , seems perfectly carbonated not close to my favorite , but tends to be hit & miss in colorado , some bottles seem to hold up better than others . this beer did n't really wow me much more in germany than now . a great beer to intoduce someone to dopplebocks though . never strays too far away from very goodness/greatness

1.00 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.60	pours a gorgeous , deep garnet red - almost burgundy - with a large , rocky , creamy-tan head which dissipates slowly leaving heavy lace on the glass . not much for smell - faint floral hops and maybe a touch of sweet yeast . after the weak nose the taste is almost shocking . moderate malt with complimentary hops . nice . moderate , chewy body that goes down clean leaving a lingering flowery hop bitterness . drinkability is fair - i could go for a second .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.70	poured into a glass beer mug . if you cant drink beer out of a mug its not a beer ! appearance- pale clear yellow smell - not much more than a hint of beer odor taste- clean . not much flavor . mouthfeel- no bitterness . very light and clean . not much for an aftertaste . drinkability- easy to drink . would be good on a hot day . nothing unique or interesting about the flavor .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.90	trying to get over my anti-nb bias and sample their full selection of cheap and widely available beers . hoptober , activate ! a : poured into a pint glass . if this were actually a golden ale ( or a pilsner , for that matter ) , i 'd grade it higher , but damned it if does n't taste every bit like a pale ale , and the wimpy head and fizzy yellow color do not match . s : pretty basic . bready malt ( little bit of rye ? ) and citrusy hops . t : far exceeds the smell . reminds me of sumpin sumpin and mirror pond . surprisingly complex malt and hop profile given the unremarkable smell . as others have said , this needs to be relabeled a pale ale and changed to a spring or summer seasonal . maybe add some wheat to the grain bill to for good measure . m : heavy on the carbonation , but makes it more refreshing , which again makes it a better candidate for a summer seasonal . d : almost perfect but there 's a little bit of a dry tartness that will sit heavily on the palate after a while . nb actually did a good job on pretty much every aspect of this beer except the labeling . fire the guy who decided this was a golden ale and that it should be released in the fall .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	a - light cooper , with blond highlights in the corners . s - lots of aroma hops . citrusy smelling . t - i think this tastes very clean for a ipa . citrus , pine maybe ? m - great mouth feel . d - all around a above average ipa . i really could knock a few of these back .

0.60 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	poured from a 500ml bottle ... expiration date of 23 june 2009 . appearance : huge head of foam with lively carbonation . light amber in color . 1.5 inch off-white foam that leaves some lacing . smell : smells is mostly malts , with a hint of hops somewhere in back . taste : a combination of caramel flavors , with an interesting malt profile . while looking at this one i thought it was going to taste way overcarbonated , but it seems to fit the beer fairly well . perhaps a bit too much carbonation though for my tastes ... mouthfeel : great body , that goes down smooth . drinkablity : only issue here is with the carbonation , i think that would start to bother me after a few ... note : recently had this on tap , and it was highly inferior to both the cask and bottled versions ... much thinner , without the great flavours ... .

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	this brew is orangey , very pale amber with a foamy white ipa head , just like its non-aged brother . aroma is pretty much identical , i do n't really not any `` oak '' or `` smokey '' characteristics in the nose ... just straight up ipa , lots of citrus and grapefruit , a kiss of pine . on to the taste , where the oak shows up . taste is woody , a little smoky , like something fresh off the grill , all of which mixes with the citrusy resins of the hoppiness of this big brew . the wood adds a little more body and heft to the brew ( the original is very light for the style , but still tasty ) and this one has more meat , so to speak . that said , the original is still superior , as it hides the alcohol very well and is not overwhelmed by one flavor . this is an interesting and good brew , but there 's not enough for me here to keep coming back to this brew over the original .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.90	presentation : it was poured from a half-gallon growler into a dimpled mug . appearance : it had a nice , deep amber colored body with good clarity . the head was creamy white in color and thin . it faded fast leaving just a ring of bubbles on top of the body . smell : the aroma had earthy and herbal hops with a hint of sweet malt and a touch of lemon oil . taste/mouth feel : its flavor had a good mix of sweet , caramel and bready malts with leafy/herbal hops and a hint of sweet lemon . its mild hop bitterness fades off the tongue in the finish . the texture is smooth and mellow with soft carbonation . it is very drinkable and medium bodied . notes : i love a good oktoberfest and this one fits the bill nicely .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.40 0.20	thanks to jim for sending me this treat which had not been on my radar . pours a murky golden copper with two fingers of head and spotty lacing . the aroma is quite strong with floral hops and a stinging tequila burn . not much else to say really , very unique . the flavor is a bit watery with some floral and earthy hops , lots of bready malts , dry oakiness , and some alcohol burn . i ca n't say that i can pinpoint tequila as the culprit . the flavor is poor here , there is just nothing positive to note . the body is medium and the finish is full of acetone . overall this one is unfortunately a drain pour . i enjoy tequila so my hopes were high , they just were n't met .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	a- an opaque redish brown , with an exceptional creamy head . 10 minutes after the pour , the head is going strong . s- plum , raisin , must , muted hops , an old musty belgian monk . t- dark fruit , spice ( clove , nutmeg ) , some banana , some alcohol m- very nice medium mouthfeel d- very smooth , very drinkable , very nice .

0.40 0.70 0.70 0.60 0.60	bbe 2008 . poors out with hardly any head and has an amberbrown color with lots of white haze . nose is koreander , candysugar sweet and caramellic , cherryfruitand some alcohol in the back but decent for 9 % . taste is sweet and strong with again lots of candysugar and only limited maltyness ( wonder how they boosted the alcohol ) . aftertaste shows bitterness but sweetness keeps hanging longer . smooth and sticky mouthfeel with quiet low carbonisation and do n't think much bottlefermantation has happened . still not a bad brew and drinkable but kind of flat and sticky .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	i do not like this beer , no sirree , not at all . it poured a hazy straw , with a fizzy head . it looks pretty nice . the nose was of juicy fruit gum , banana and clove . is this a tripel or a hefe ? whatever it is , it 's all esters . it 's thin and fizzy in the mouth , none of that roundness that imo , a tripel should have . the malt base was undectable , under all the fruit , bublegum and cloves . there 's a fair amount of booze burn , even though there 's not much alcohol in the taste . it 's like a really high alcohol hefe , except that sounds yummy and this is not . new holland makes some nice brews , they really do , but this is not one of them . this just misses the softness , roundness and sophistication that a good tripel has . there 's no trace of malt and really not much more than crazy esters . i drank half of a twelve ounce bottle before giving up and feeding it to my sink .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	a- hazy orange with hardly any head that dissapates quickly . this is a big dissapointment . i expect a huge head with a hefe but no matter how aggressive i pour , results are the same . s- little more promising here . nice strong malt , wheat , banana . this really smells like a good hefe should . t- suprisingly this is very similar to some of its german counterparts . nice big malt and fruit flavor . some citrus and spice hints that give way near the finish m- medium body with a silky smooth feel . light to medium carbonation . d- no unpleasent flavor or feel at all with this beer and relative balance make it pretty easy to drink . overall- after the pour i was a bit dissapointed . upon first smell though i realized i might have something here . although not as refined as others like some other ig name hefe , its overall flavor and feel is very nice . dont pass on trying this out , its definitely worth it .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	[ best served in a dimpled mug ] poured a muddy dark brown in color with a light brown head the dissipated at an average pace . aroma was that of coffee , chocolate and toasted malts.tasted of coffee and chocolate with hint of hops the aftertaste being the same and lasting only a few seconds . mouthfeel was smooth and creamy but slightly watery , a medium bodied brew . overall a good brown ale but i have had better .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	1/4 inch head , ruby red and almost brown in the center of the glass . nose suggests plums , cherries and raisons , obviously . the aromas is wonderfully sweet and rich , with perhaps a bit of bittersweet chocolate in there ... tasting reveals a rich raison and plum base and a toffee malt middle . the finish is what makes this one special : crisp , dry , and lonnnggg lingering . very nice . the moutfeel is creamy and smooth with that terrific carbonation . drinkability is impressive for a dubbel-like beer . i always wondered how this one was sold in 6'ers , but i can see why now . i 'd have no problem knocking back a half-dozen of these . reminds me ( fondly ) of ommegang 's abbey-style .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.70	fermented with cheyenne canyon brett had this on tap tonight . poured chestnut/mahogany with near zero head . s : cherries , oakyness & tartness , along with hints of vanilla & leather t : tartness , sourness & cherries & prunes up front . a bit more wooodyness & cherry-pit as this warms . finishes sooo dry with much tartness , hints of cherry , wood leather & raspberry vinegar medium-bodied with near zero carbonation & vinegar-like zing drinks good for what it is , went well with the cheeses that accompanied this . i 'd be hard pressed to do more than 2 glasses a session/meal tough . sour beer freaks should love it . still a style i 'm coming to grips with

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	this is one of those beers you just sit back and marvel at once poured . it has a deep , copper/mahogany color with stunning clarity and a beautiful head . as you drink it , the head sticks to the glass in an array of little bubbles . such a nice looking brew ! the aroma gives off toasted biscuit , a touch of raisin , dried currants , a little wet earth , and a good blast of hops . on the tongue , this one is no lightweight - a lot of big , malt expressions and a liberal amount of hoppy bitterness - yet it is quite well-balanced . it has a nice full body , and a smooth mouthfeel . it is strong without being overly aggressive . after a couple , you 're definitely feeling warm inside , which makes it a great beer to quaff down on a cold , winter 's night . a big thumbs up for me .

0.90 0.40 0.90 0.80 0.70	this one is from batch four bottled feb 2010 . poured this straight down this middle of my stemmed glass ; just as the bottle told me to . pours a rich dark ruby color with an off white four finger monster of a head . the head looks really nice and has nice retention . lots of sticky lacing . i 'm actually kind of having trouble picking up some of the aromas on this . i definitely smell the dried plumbs and other dark fruits . other than that i can only smell a trace of alcohol and aromas that can only be explained as earthy . sweet malts and the dried prunes take the forefront on the taste of this one . warming spices such as cloves coat my pallet on this nice dry finish . hints of vanilla . really a lot going on with this one . after the aroma i was a little afraid this would be a hot boozy mess . however , it has a nice silky mouth feel with subtle tingling carbonation . not heat and a nice comforting beer to cap the night off .

1.00 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80	a- one of the most unique and beautiful beers , the cascading is a site to behold . starts off creamy white and then cascades from the bottom of the glass to the top changing to black as it goes . there is a thick off white head that lasts forever and covers the sides of the glass in foam and thick rings that mark each swallow . s- roasted malt , earth tones , a couple of whiffs of metal or the nitrogen widget not sure which . not much of an aroma though . t- roasted malt , faint hint of chocolate and coffee , slightly bitter hit of hops for the aftertaste . m- creamy and smooth but thin in the mouth . finish is a slightly dry . d- at 4.2 % abv there is no danger of it being a one and done beer . goes down easy and smooth and pairs well with almost any food . a classic beer and the one that ushered me into the world of beers outside of marco-lagers . while this one no longer compares to what i would call a world class beer , it will always be a special one for me .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.40 0.40	i 'm sorry to report that sam adams has kept in tradition with their fruit beer products , and that is failure to produce a beer that actually tastes like beer with a bit of fruit added , the way it should be . it 's a very pretty golden color with lots of carbonation making for a thick , white head that lasts a long time . when i opened the bottle my nose was blown away with the fruit aroma , that was my first clue it was n't going to be good . growing up in boy scouts and being in the woods a lot , i know what berries smell like . this aroma is definately artifical , and the taste is akin to it . the beer left a strange numbing sensation on my tongue that was very dissatisfying . had i been in town for the taste trials , i probably would have gone with the other one .

0.40 0.30 0.80 0.40 0.60	i do not like heineken . period . whenever someone tells me heineken is their favorite brew , they lose a few points of respect in my book . i say this only semi-joking . a -- meh . what do you want me to say . horrible retention , next to no lacing , piss color . average on a good day . s -- smells like a skunked beer ( which is what you get when you bottle brews in green and/or clear bottles ) . nasty and off-putting , in other words . t -- tastes like it smells . m -- okay , not bad in this regard , i have to give credit where credit is due . but just because it 's fairly crisp does n't mean it 's refreshing ( skunk , anyone ? ) . d -- suffers due to a nasty smell , with an equally nasty taste . the dutch can keep this garbage , for all i care .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.80	a 330ml bottle fills a duvel tulip with garnet elixir topped with lots and lots of creamy head . the head dies down to a nice cap but persists throughout . the smell is malty and somewhat sweet with plenty of alcohol . some dark fruit comes through as the alcohol dissipates . alcohol again on the taste but that 's the only knock against it . not too sweet but with plenty of caramel maltiness and some spicing . the taste reminds me of a slightly oxidized tawny port , though it 's much thinner on the mouthfeel and very well , perhaps excessively well , carbonated . the drinkability is decent but there 's no getting around the 10.5 % alcohol and the innate richness . given that , though , it 's about as drinkable as you could hope for .

0.60 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	clear yellowish golden color with a surprisingly fluffy white head . vegetal aroma though not corn ... wood , earth , artificial sweetener and white grape juice . this lacks any real 'stink ' . the palate is quite dry for a ml ... wait , no , it 's quite dry period . chewy pale malty flavor with grapes , earth , grass and a clean crisp hoppy finish . medium bodied given the abv % and 'gravity ' with a slick mouth feel ( not sticky ! ) and an unusual crispness . this certainly lives up to the moniker . it 's very smooth and easy to drink . it does n't make your eyes go all wacky from the rancid taste ... i almost miss that in a 24 ounce get drunk quick delivery system . many respectable strong lagers are n't this tasty . suspiciously , too good ... 6/3/7/5/16/3.7

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.90	sam adams will forever have a special place in my heart . now that that is out of the way , this is the first time i am reviewing one of there beers a : rich amber color , nice and clear , with a thick foamy white head about half an inch thick that retains well . plenty of carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass as well . s : a mild caramel aroma with only the slightestbit of earthy hops . t : good malt backbone of caramel and bits of toffee with the slightest hint of apple fruitiness . the hops are very mild . m : medium body and light feel . nothing great to note , but nothing outstanding . d : like many sam adams beer this is very easy to drink multiple of .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.40	a - light golden color with a small head and a lot of carbination s - metallic smell to it , like it has been massed produced . t/m - very floral many esters of rose type flower . the taste to me is weak and the taste in your mouth lingers in a bad way d - i say drink about 2 of these beers and will be sick of it . if u wan na try a summer ale def go with samuel a .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	i had out of a bottle at boulevard tavern in williamsburg , brooklyn . a- there 's a ton of sediment in there . it 's gold , fairly opaque , with a nice head and lacing . s- it has a very sweet , wheat scent . t- it has a very strong lemony taste . extremely sweet . it 's a very high quality beer , but way too sweet . it 's not for me , but i can see its quality .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	pours a nice golden/dark straw color , with no head and almost no lacing ; a bit of carbonation and it appears to be filtered . it has a nice scent , very strong wheat aroma , almost like being out in a field ; there is a slightly jerky/hoppy scent to it , as well . great flavor , a wonderful wheat ale ; it has a very strong , deep wheat flavor , but is very much an american wheat ale , as there are just very small hints of banana/clove , not a ( strong or true ) hefe or a wit . it goes down extremely smooth , one of the easiest wheat ales i 've drank in a long time . well worth a try for anyone , especially fans of straight wheat ales without much else to take over a great deep wheat taste .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.50	this is not too bad for a malt liquor . pale color , active head , strong carbonation . it is cheap strong abv , pale , cheap , and oh yea , it is cheap . no great or bad flava . just some corn taste . i would rate it a bit higher on the drinkability if : 1. it was not so bighty on the carbonation and 2. if it were n't rancid when warm . keep it cold , pound 3 or 4 and you have a cheap buzz . suckem up and movem out ! giblet

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.80	i poured a 16 ounce can into a pint glass . the beer is pale yellow in appearance with a fair amount of white head that dissipated quickly . the smell was a typical macro corn scent . the taste was okay . the mouthfeel was okay too . it goes down real easy . this is one of my favorites to drink after mowing the lawn , but not exactly an award winner .

0.20 0.20 0.30 0.20 0.40	ugh . smells skunky . pours with soda pop carbonation . tastes rotten . how does one review a beer such as this ? it 's just really really bad . are there any redeeming qualities ? sure ! you can drink about 100 of these things without killing yourself ( why anyone would want to is beyond me ) . just not a good beer . thank god there was only 1 left in the cooler .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80	a-pours a dark copper with a thin white head that leaves a subsiding lace down the glass , as it settles down theres barely a head left and the lacing becomes very watery and disappates . s-malty , caramel and some kind of legume . sort of a toasted biscuity aroma hidden behind a mellow dark fruit . t-definitely malty , smokey and a little caramel near the end , a nutty and dark fruit flavor is deep in there . i also taste some adjuncts in there which im not fond of ( its said that rice has no taste , but i disagree , i get a taste of it in here ) i expect it was used as a filler to make the beers price cheaper . i was expecting a bolder flavor out of a scotch style ale out of seattle , i would have liked more hops for a more bitter finish and a higher alcohol content to give it that extra bite , its not bad but i was expecting more . m-light body but the flavors and malts give it a pallete heaviness which is actually very nice , it goes down smooth but doesnt completely leave your tongue . d-it is actually a very easy to drink ale , i would have liked more hops and alcoholic bite but i think i would pick this up again . not a bad price either for what youre drinking .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	a - pours a very light yellow-ish colour with little lacing s - very faint corn and grains t - the taste basically follows the smell , which is basically a very faint corn and grains m - an extremely light bodied mouthfeel d - unthinkable and undrinkable

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	3 oz sample from my home town brewery in fort wayne , indiana . . this brew poured no head what so ever and left no lacing accordingly . it had a transparent dark black brown body and a nice malty aroma . it had a strong foretaste that was too strong for a typical bock , which is my favorite style . it finished with a strong bitter aftertaste . not smooth enough compared to the german bocks .

0.90 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	on tap in a nonic pint glass at the brewpub on 3/8/11 deep amber ; hazy and dulled . one and a half finger head dissipates very slowly . good retention and a solid half wall of lace . some floral hops meander about but this smells an awful lot like candy . some caramel , too . the aroma is pretty weak overall . earthy hops and a decent bitterness hits the palate , but nothing over the top . hints of past-prime citrus move in toward the mid-section . solid caramel base with some toasted bread on the finish . said toastiness keeps things from being too sweet . fairly average . medium-full body with a thickness that is grainy and coating . finishes as it tastes . carbonation is a touch higher than average . this could be a lot better ( certainly more hop-forward ) but it does n't seem poorly-crafted . perhaps it 's a west coast take on the east coast style ?

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 1.00	poured into my trusty delirium tremens snifter , explodes with a reverse-cascading , creamy mocha-colored head that settles down just before eclipsing the rim of the glass . the head very slowly fades to a 1 cm cap atop this impenetrably black brew , leaving beautiful , copious lacing everywhere . perfection in appearance . notes of bittersweet chocolate and roasty coffee in the nose . taste follows smell , with the chocolate and coffee flavors mingling ; a nice hint of hops is detectable on the finish as well . mouthfeel was very nice , with a thick richness characteristic of the style . it did n't have the viscosity of dark lord , but then , exceedingly few do . drinkability was exceptional ; i found myself finishing the glass rather quickly and wanting more . had to wake up early the next morning , so i refrained . at 10.5 % , i can see how this one could get dangerous , as the flavor does not make the abv apparent at all . a wonderful beer , and definitely one of my favorite stouts thus far .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.70	let 's start with first impressions : this big beer makes a big impression on appearance . dark and sinister looking , the rough-textured mocha-colored head sits atop the black body like a russian fur cap . the bottle art featuring a drawing of rasputin does n't hurt the overall effect either . lacing is full and sticky . the scent is of a distinctly toasted , malty quality . a yeastiness also meets the nose . the big scent is followed up by an even bigger flavor . thick malts , yeast , burnt coffee and an exceptionally sticky mouthfeel combine to create a hearty drinking experience . a treat not to be taken lightly , and not likely to be consumed in very large quantities .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.80	a : clear golden body . thin white head . decent retention with little lacing . s : equal parts malt & skunk ( the stink of the macro ) . t : some light fruit but really not that much of a flavor . better than a macro , but for an apa , not cutting it . m : a bit fizzy up front , but that seemed to even out later . d : goes down easy enough , but i need more in a beer . is this really an apa ? if so , it 's my least favorite of the style . if not , well , chalk it up as a style i 'm not in love with .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90	a : pours a dull straw yellow color . a small bubbly white head forms and leaves little lace . s : grain and cereal . husky with a little hop bit toward the end . t : very nice . lots of bready and cereal malt that is a little sweet . the hop character is none to small either . citrus and piney flavors . m/d : a light body that is crisp and clean . very easy and smooth to drink . i sessioned this with no problem . this is a very good mexican lager . blows almost everything else i have had from that country away as far as beer goes .

0.70 0.30 0.40 0.30 0.30	poured from a 12oz bottle into a loterbol tulip . a : pours a dark , night-sky black . small khaki-colored head that goes away rather fast , leaving no lace . s : coffee and chocolate that 's steamrolled by an extremely off-putting buttery aroma that could n't be more out of place . t : once again , there are slight espresso and chocolate flavors that are obliterated by that buttery nastiness . it wants to be bittersweet and creamy but a pervasive tart/tangy fruit flavor comes in and wrecks everything . ick . m : very thin and , sadly , not inspiring at all . cringe inducing combination of tart and buttery . d : this was damn near awful . i have a feeling , judging by the early reviews , that this bottle was from an extremely substandard batch that slipped by qc . this was drainpour .

1.00 0.40 0.70 0.90 0.80	a : beautiful beer ! it 's a perfectly clear light amber color topped by a big-bubble , thin but foamy head . lacing is alright , but the beer looks so good it makes up for that in other areas . s : this is the second wet hop beer that i 've had today , and this one , sadly , looses out on aroma between the two . the most dominant aroma is some caramel from the malt . it has a mild mild mild earthiness to it as well . t : bitterness right up front followed by this great caramel note and finishes with these wonderful tropical-fruit hops . for what this beer lacks in aroma , it sure makes up for in taste . m : a bit light on the body , but good moderately high levels of carbonation to help bring the hops into full effect . d : this drinks fine and smoothly , it 's a nice sipping beer , but it 's so smooth you could easily drink more than intended .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.50	thanks to mdaschaf for this ! excited to try something by a brewery i have n't yet tried . poured a nice pumpkin orange with a big frothy white head that left spots of lacing here and there . very clear with bubbles streaming from the apex of the glass . very fruity with hints of lychee , pears , and white grapes . touch of metallicness and honey . flavor is highly fruit-forward , with the aforementioned flavors highly pronounced . not much malt detectable except more clover honey and bitterness is clean in the finish . dry and well carbonated . alcohol warmth is slightly noticeable , odd for a beer less than 6 % drinking like it 's 8-9 % .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	the colour is very dark wine red . the foam is beige , compact and firm.it dissolves slowly until it is three fingers thick . the smell is sweet , burned with a generous body . there are notes of cocoa , coffee , dark bread and maybe some hazelnuts . i could also feel some aroma and bitter hops . nice ! the carbonation is fine : rich and soft at the same time . the taste is sweet with an interesting touch of whiskey . the taste got a rich body including notes of coffee , milk chocolate and a fruity , gentle taste of aroma hops ( typical for micros , i might say ) . the aftertaste is almost watery compared to the taste , but there are some sweet aroma hops , and a nice sour finish . a fine beer , but i found it somewhat incoherent .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	2005 offering thanks to cornboy . pours an intense orange/cherry with a full finger of fluffy off-white head . lacing is thin , but coats the side of my snifter beautifully . aroma is a buttery citrus ... no hint of any alcohol . the taste is fantastic ... pears , oranges , w/ a distinct malt backbone . texture is thick and smooth ... a bit too carbonated . this beer tastes as if it was aged in bourbon barrells for a bit , due to its bite . alcohol is somewhat apparent , but drinkability is real good . i would really love the opportunity to try this one on tap . great stuff !

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.40	looks like fizzy yellow pale beer , no lacing on the minimal head . aroma of banana and clove , very muted . more muted banana taste , pricklier feel , be it from the hops or the carbonation . taste certainly exceeded appearance , some lemon came in . light bodied , lightly hopped , little bitterness , but close to full flavored , a decent hot weather beer . kind of pricey for what you get .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.90 0.80	it comes out of the bottle a rich transparent reddish-brown with a fairly thick tan head . aroma is nice and malty , not too strong . flavor is strong and mouth-filling , malty , smoky , a little peaty with just a touch of sweetness , like molasses . very smooth but with a little bit of a bite .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.40 0.80	pours golden , clear and fizzy , with little or no head and no lace smell reveals very slight trace of hops which are displayed all over the packaging - reminded me of trying to smell a domestic light beer ( pointless ) the taste is on about the same level as the smell drinkability was fair , i would n't mind drinking one or two over the grill or outside in the summer to quench my thirst but other than that i 'll steer away

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.60	750ml bottle split . poured into a triple karmeliet tulip . no date . a - poured a dark , almost opaque ruby color with extremely little head even on an aggressive pour . carbonation coming up the middle and a ring of tan bubbles but that 's it . s - aroma consists of very yeasty malty sweetness and heavy dark fruit , raisin obviously one of them . alcohol comes through pretty strong . fruity esters and a cola hint too . very full , huge smell . t - the alcohol pushes through the robust malty sweetness with some force . dark fruits and raisins also monopolize the palate in an interesting way . the dry and slightly bitter finish could be attested to a slight coffee hint . roasted malts for sure ? m - warming of alcohol and a dry , almost bitter finish , with a fairly smooth mouthfeel with a little bit of carbonation bite to it . d - when all is said and one the judgement day is good for sure but it 's drinkability is on the lower end . high in abv and very robust full body do n't allow ease of passage to the belly .

0.30 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.70	it pours the transparent golden yellow color that one would expect . there is an airy , pure white head that rises to the top at first . a minute or 2 later the beer takes on an awful look . the head dissapears , and i cant find a single bubble in it if i try . it really begins to look like a glass of piss . the scent is fine . quite a lot better than other beers of its style . not bready at all , which is a nice relief . it tastes good considering the style . it really reminds me a of a pilsener , almost like a version of a german pilsener without the overwhelming skunky flavor . tastes crisp and is quite refreshing . a little watery , but it must be nearly impossible to avoid that when brewing a light beer . the mouthfeel is light as expected , and is a touch on the flat side , but nothing terrible . drinkability is average . in the grand scheme of beer , this might not be much , but it excells when compared to beers of its class .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.30	a : this sour brown ale , true to its name , pours deep ruby-tinted brown , with a quickly-vanishing two-finger head that is also a rich burnt-straw-brown mahogany . s : overwhelmingly sour nose , with hints of a sweet whiskey background . t : pungently sour , the bite engulfs the tongue . the taste bears hints of oaken vanilla from the cask , and give it a dry finish . m : sharp , crisp , tangy . high carbonation , but little else to speak of . d : low . the sour acidity overwhelms , making more than 8-10 ounces a challenge , much less the entire bomber . definitely not a session beer . maybe i 'm just not a sour beer drinker , as this is perhaps a well-crafted beer for its style , but not what i like to experience when tasting a fourteen-dollar bottle of beer .

1.00 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	thought this beer had a really nice color . an excellent color . a deep deep red . i 'm thinking mahogony , but i 'm not sure exactly what color that ... but i 'm thinking like a deep deep wood varnish color ... really nice . great head too . the taste is a little on the light side for me , but bigger than say corsendonk . some nice dark candy sugar notes with just a barely perceptible belgian funkiness maybe sharpness/sourness ? that works well with the the sweetness . mouthfeel is thin for me , but i 'm not super familiar with this style , maybe it is supposed to be .

0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.80	i picked this up because it was the cheapest beer on the shelf . it certainly is n't the worst , though . it looks like common fizzy yellow beer . my wife commented that it does n't look like beer . she is used to seeing better beer . hops are more noticeable than i 've come to expect from pabst . it is much more balanced than pbr . the mouthfeel is light and watery with lots of fizz . it finishes with a brief , but strong hint of apple . overall , while i 'm not a huge fan of the style , i 'd have to say i have a new favorite american macro lager . very drinkable . if the intention is to get drunk , this is the ideal beer . if the intention is to enjoy some good beer , look elsewhere .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	16.9oz bottle . pours an opaque black with a creamy tan head that retains well and laces the glass . the aroma is sweet malts and oatmeal with some chocolate , black licorice and coffee and a little dark fruit and alcohol . the flavor is sweet sugary lactic chocolate with some coffee . it has a big sharp roasted bitterness in the finish . the mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little watery . overall , very nice . i recall thinking the beer geek breakfast was a little better balanced and more enjoyable .

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	got a single of this the other day , and poured it into my mug and the appearance is beautiful . hazy straw color , best looking ive seen in a hefe . poured a great foamy head and the lacing is equally great . smelled banana right a way and the strongest banana flavor ive had in a hefe . the mouthffeel was a little to carbonated and the aftertaste was hidden by this which is usually the problem for me for hefes . also felt it was a bit watery . bottom line is that this is one of the better hefes out there because of the great smell .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	this brew is quite hazy with a golden orange body . the head produced is massive and bright white . aromas are grainy and husky with a powdery essense . the taste is a bit tart with peach like flavors . this feels a little powdery but smooth . i 'd have to say this is one of the best keller biers i 've ever tried .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.70	750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass . appearance-brilliant ruby color with good clarity-absolutely gorgeous . moderate pale-pinkish head with decent retention . aroma-smells like a ludens cough drop . very sweet cherry aroma , almost cloyingly so . the cherry notes are extremely intense , but somewhat one-dimensional , and the sweetness is a bit deterring , but as it warms it shows a slight hint of oak character , which helps temper the sweetness . flavor-not quite as sweet as the aroma , which is relieving . up front there is a lot of cherry flavor , but fortunately there 's a little more depth than in the aroma . subtle dark fruit flavors ( plum and prune ) linger in the background , along with some light tartness and a hint of tannic oak . finish is still rather sweet , and has a soft cherry note to it , along with a smidgeon of malt . mouthfeel-medium full body with moderate to moderately low carbonation . i personally would prefer it a little bit lighter and a bit more carbonated . i 'm just okay on this one . it 's a bit overly sweet for my tastes , and the cherry notes are somewhat one-dimensional , especially in the nose . tastes more like cherry soda than a complex belgian-style kriek .

1.00 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.60	12 oz from total wine . a - dark maroon with lots of capuccino colored head . dissipates slow with light legs . s - red cherries , oak chips , anise , and honey . t - oaky , malty , and cherries . m - chewy , slightly bitter and dry . not liking the ending bitterness . way too much earthy hops . d - the mouthfeel really throws off this beer . i really like the regular one though .

0.50 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.90	moat mountain actually brews this year round which i think is awesome . lively orange with a small white head . retention is pretty weak though not necessarily shameful for the style . smells of bready malt with a tinge of marmalade sweetness . taste is similiar bready malt with orange marmalade sweet but highlight of this beer is in the spicey , hop hinted swallow . carbonation is right on .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.70	found this at the cracked kettle in amsterdam . from a 750ml bottle into a snifter . note : this should be listed as a stout . the brewer himself even calls it a stout . appearance : pours a two finger thick tight bubbly dark tan head with very good retention . jet black body with minimal carbonation . head slowly fades to a good foam cap and leaves some nice lacing right away . a thin film remains until the end leaving some good looking lacing down the sides . a nice beer to look at . smell : mild nose of roasted malts and a good dose of dark chocolate . mostly bitter pure chocolate . nice , though not as bold as i 'd hoped . taste : roasted malts again , with some nice smoky notes . lots of pure chocolate as well and finishes with a good dose of hop bitterness . mild but long lasting aftertaste of sweet milk chocolate and bitter pure chocolate together . a powdery finish with hints of cocoa powder as well . nice job here . palate : medium body and medium carbonation . smooth going down , no bite , and finishes powdery with an appropriate amount of dryness on the palate . could be a little heavier for the style . overall : a nice chocolate stout for sure , but not necessarily better than any of the other top chocolate stouts i 've had . one worth having once , and the pretty bottle is worth keeping , but given the heavy price tag , i do n't think i 'll be looking for this one again .

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.50 0.50	it has the classic guinness pour , recognizable to all beer drinkers . smells highly of burnt malts , however , and like day-old coffee . tastes like a dirty old sock mixed with coffee and scorched malt . not overly carbonated , and did n't kill my tastebuds . still was n't very drinkable , however . if i was still in high school , i 'd think it was awesome , if not solely for the fact that it has a higher abv than the regular . but the only reason i even had it was that i asked my girlfriend to pick up a good porter or chocolate stout to make a float with for dessert , and she snagged this ( beer-wise , she only drinks bud light ) , and it was n't even good until the ice cream had fully melted to mask the beer . i could go the rest of my life without drinking this again and not feel the least bit bad .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.80	a - minimal head standing at a mere eighth of an inch . the white head fades quick to leave only wisps . the brew 's body is a slightly hazy orange . s - apple , subtle banana and actually pretty inviting . t - nice english hop with a citrus accent to start . from there the flavor tapers back slowly in a methodical way . i like it . m - the feel is watery throughout with an early-middle of coarseness to help bring up those english hops . ~ this is one i do enjoy . i 'm not sure i 'd take it over other autumn seasonal beers but i believe it has it 's place . i like the unique twist with the bitterness at the start .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.20 0.30	a- great fall auburn color . fluffy head delivered through a vigorous pour . s- weak aroma . a bit sweet and malty , not much else . t- artificial vanilla bean flavor is just disgusting in this beer . highly annoying after a couple sips . i dont think i 'm a big fan of vanilla flavors in beer at all , especially this one . m- it has a soft character on the palate , and good carbonation . d- its drinkable , but barely . my girlfriend says this one reminds her of cough syrup , i kind of agree .

0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . best by 11.10.11 . a - pours a pretty clear color with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly . s - sweet malts , like portuguese sweet bread , along with faint spicy hops and slightly yeasty . t - delicious sweet bread flavors start this one off , almost somewhat banana-y . it 's followed by floral and spicy bitterness that seems to balance it out with near perfection . a semi dry finish with slight lasting bitterness . m - carbonation is to the style ; semi dry finish ; light bodied . o - this is a lager to write home about ! despite many unique characteristics , it still manages to focus on being a well balanced , thoroughly flavorful , brew .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.70 1.00	sampling a 1l pop top bottle of the 2010 batch , which was available nov-dec '10 ... . a- love the bottle with the pop top ... .very royal looking bottle shape as well ! pours about as dark a black/brown as you 're gon na find anywhere , and has just a tinge of cola hues around the top and bottom ring of liquid . the head is dense and puffy with caramel coloring . it retains very well , settling slowly from around two-three inches thick to about a half inch thick cloud . lacing is sticky and foams nicely on my glass ! s- the aromas are dominated by freshly brewed coffee and a mild milk chocolate undertone . there is a dry roasted malt character to the finish with just a hint of cherry fruit ... .i was hoping to smell just a bit more of this . maybe i 'm smelling a vague alcohol whiff here as well ... . t- the flavors are very much the same as in the aromas , with just a bit more of the cherry coming through . it starts with rich and roasted malts , followed by a blend of coffee and cocoa ... .it almost has a ground chicory root bitterness/dryness to it . the finish is where the essence of fruit is noticeable , which is nice actually , as it ends with just enough of crispy fresh cherry to warrant another drink of this elixir ! i would definitely like to taste a little more of the cherry in future offerings however , but it is there ! m- thick bodied , smooth carbonation and the alcohol hides well within the rich flavors provided here . the viscous nature of the brew glides gently over my palate , coating it well and giving me something to chew on . good job in this department ! d- normally i would n't be able to have more than a couple of porter style beers in a sitting but this one is different due to it 's slightly sweet nature . it has a refreshing finish which makes me want more ! i 'd definitely have no problem enjoying this over an evening or more likely , with a meal ! my only disappointment is that there 's not as much cherry flavor as i was hoping for , but this is a minor complaint . good job overall !

0.50 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.70	i popped the cork on this bottle and sat back waiting for something , anything to happen but it never did . the beer was completely flat . i came here to see if i just had a bad bottle but it appears this is not an isolated bottle . the look is not so different to cranberry juice . in fact , considering the lack of carbonation it looks exactly like cranberry juice . the smell is deliciously sour . the smell is the first clue that this is not indeed cranberry juice after all . the taste is worth it . this is sour , tart with some definite pucker . just enough sweetness in the back to make this beer interesting . mouthfeel suffers from a lack of carbonation . even just a little carbonation would have gone a long way towards improving this beer . as it is i enjoyed this beer . the bottle was definitely left lacking for the missing carbonation . i 'm not sure that i would buy another bottle but in the right circumstances i do n't think i would hesitate .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.50 0.50	poured a very pale yellow color with monstrous white puffy head than was soon only a memory . smell is corn , grain and unfermented malt , and not very appealling . taste follows through on the taste with a not pleasant sweetness present . finished with a somewhat bad taste in thwe mouth . there are better na 's available .

0.20 0.30 0.20 0.50 0.60	one of my bmc drinking friends brought a sixer of these and budweiser over for a barbecue . i was broke and did n't complain . poured out of a bottle with a born on date of june 25 , 2008 with an oh so pale body . this has to be the thinnest of all of the ab products i have seen , i have yet to see bud select though . displayed a soda like , egg shell white head that disappeared very quickly like most other macros . a light aroma of corn ( of course ) was present and actually i think i detected a hint of malt in there somewhere . i was very surprised to find that this beer had a light , crisp , refreshing flavor . i would venture to say that it even tasted better than bud light . it finishes ultra clean , pun intended . with the st. louis temperature being about 100 degrees on the day that i reviewed this , it was easy to imagine killing an ice cold 6 pack of these , especially if there were n't any flavorful beers around .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.80	a : dark amber , copper colored..very clear . small tan head that fades quicly . absolutley no head or film . wonderful color and clarity , but the lack of head/lacing/film dissapoints me . s : nice , well balanced smell . pumpkin is n't the main attraction , buit it 's certainly there . spices , sweet , bready malts . t : this is delicious . none of the flavors dominate the other . pumpkin , allspice , biscuit , toast and hop bitterness , but i ca n't quite make it out ... let 's just say citrus . m : smooth and rich . alcohol leaves a warming , tingling sensation on the tongue . also coats the mouth with a nice aftertaste . o : if this had any head retention whatsoever , i 'd score it a 4.5 overall..damn good beer . also , it 's pretty cool to drink a beer that started one of most well respected breweries in america .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.40	looks pretty decent for a hefe although somehow i think it will end up tasting more like a wheat ale ... pale straw yellow , slight hazy so it passes the unfiltered test . nice thick head , good rentention and lacing . so far so good . hmmmm ... smells a lot like apple juice with just a hint of wheat malt thrown in . not that good i am afraid . an attempt @ some hefe snap @ the beginning downgrades to a watery sweetness very quickly . citrus-like rind bitterness permeates throughout the entire flavor profile . mouthfeel after the initial swig is watery and weak . imo another homebrew/craftbrew that i can do without .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	poured on tap at portsmouth brewery . a nice red hued and dark chestnut body brown . nitro like creamy in texture and tan like color head in appearance . some good lacing while drinking also . bouquet is dead for an oatmeal stout , not much going here . nothing absolutely nothing . dead on arrival . taste is bitter , acrid with burnt malts . light roasting character in the palate and light bodied but with lots of char and carbon it seems . there is some mild milk chocolate sensations on this which sort of save it from being subpar . feel for this style is a bit too wet . overall this is a pretty average oatmeal stout , there is much better and exciting to have than this , even out of the bottle on the shelf .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.60	a long time want , knocked off the list by ryan011235 . batch e ! 018 . appearance this is a pretty one . lots of lively carbonation can be seen through it 's clear , pale golden body . aroma i do love a stinky , funky beer . this one is very horsey with a shot of lemon sourness . it has a chalky , earthy , funky yeast profile to the overall bouquet . taste i 'm really not enjoying this as much as i expected to . its acidic and quite sour . the flavors of the vinegar acidity comprise a bit of a tomato ketchup flavor that i just ca n't shake . mouthfeel this beer feels as carbonated as it looks , but the bubbles are n't so sharp as to be painful . the finish is semi dry and the body is light . it really does have the feel down for an easy drinking wild . overall i could take it or leave it . its visually appealing and smells good . from there , however , it seems this beer slipped . i ca n't call it a bad beer , but average is close enough .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.40	appearence : good gold to copper hue . head was slightly off white , and a little thin with loose bubbles . aroma : not as hoppy as i would expect , but there is some hop presence there , similar in strength to a typical apa . taste : hop flavor is definately there . similar to dfh90 . not as spicey as the typical hallertaue usage in other products i thought . does n't showcase the noble hop well . mildly grassy . the malt notes are solid . malty sweetness is detectable . mouthfeel : greasy feel to it from the abundance of hops . its like tasting the hop flower itself rather than the essence of the hop . resiny quality presists on the tongue . overall : lacks a clean finish of pilsner . not terribly drinkable , it presents itself like a pale ale rather than a pilsner .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	a medium sized tan , creamy head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles.the body was dark brown and the lacing was fair.the nose was chocolate and the flavor was mild coffee and sweet chocolate.the mouthfeel of this beer was smooth , tingly , thin , watery and light bodied.there was a slight aftertaste observed with this beer .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80	served in a pilsner glass from a bottle at 37f about 5 weeks before the freshness date . the foam is perfect as is the amber clear color ; perfectly bright . perfect lace leaving a marker of each sip . on appearance , it would be no surprise you 're about the quaff the stuff of legends . the smell is the definition of the pilsner style . grassy , grainy smell that gives a hint of the taste ... ... which is a bit cardboardy in mine . there 's the sort of pancake flavor and hay , with the light malt and hops balancing each other out . the mouthfeel is light and vaguely astringent . yes , this is a different beer than i remember and it 's easy to bash it for having become a macrobrew and having , you know , clean equipment ( the horror ! ) but i think this beer is of high quality and suffers from comparison to its self of old .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.70	pours a beautiful light honey color , having little to no head kept it from getting a better score . smell was decent . nothing lept out at me but you could smell subtle hints of a sweet barley and spice , giving it a nice little bite at the end . mouthfeel is smooth and finishes off fresh with no residual film . not an amazing beer , but a very decent one that i would n't hesitate to have again .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.80	pours a clear straw color with a small diappointing head , also there are some unidentifiable objects floating around . the aroma is faint but does have some slight notes of maltiness . the taste is of bready malt and not much else . it 's not grainy or adjuncty , just bland . the feel is light and nicely carbonated , finishes neutral . drinkability is good , no off-putting flavors . bland for the most part , just a hint of malt . i believe this brew has its place . it good for when you want something light and you do n't need to serve it ice cold to drink it .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	a : pours a translucent and effervescent golden , capped by a half finger of white foam . the head dissipates quickly , leaving some scant bubbles and lacing across the top of the beer . s : sweet , pale malts arrive at the nose first , followed by distinct notes of oak , vanilla , citrus , and funk . a light acidity follows but never overtakes the malty base . the sweetness and vanilla are a bit out of character , but damn ... it smells really inviting . t : more tart than the nose lets on , the acidity becomes apparent as soon as it hits my mouth but never surpasses a moderate level . lots of lemon zest and citrus notes up front , it moves into a slightly funked malt base with some oak notes on the edges , moving back intro citrusy tartness for the finish . the vanilla from the nose is strangle absent ... the taste is closer to style , but i 'm really curious how some sweet vanilla would have mingled with the flavors . m : medium body with moderate to high carbonation . d : goes down very smooth and with the tartness being kept to a restrained level , it would be easy to put down quite a few of these .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	12oz bottle . pours a light bronze with notable carbonation . aroma is divine with the smell of fresh hops - going so far as to remind me of the aroma of some cask ales . flavour is heavy hops on the piney side . bold and full hoppy aftertaste . rewarding . re-rate : just had a fresh bottle . absolutely outstanding . the fresh hops were n't as piney as i previously found .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.70	served in a standard pint . a . black as night , half finger of light brown head with great retention . very good lacing on the glass . s. loads of piney hops , so much so i thought it was a black ipa . some coffee roast and a little chocolate on the back end . a bit of spiciness suggests anise , licorice . not the best smelling stout . t. hops are more refined on the palate as the coffee , chocolate , and roasted malt take center stage . a hoppy , dry finish suggests more anise . good , not great . m. hops dominate the mouthfeel . oddly light body that never really realizes the malty , roasted qualities of a stout . o . an untraditional dry stout . not bad , but would have been a better black ipa . the anise finish is off-putting .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.70	poured into my duvel tulip a - pours a dark reddish-brown color with a huge pillowy tan head . this is absolutely beautiful , and took a good 3 minutes to recede enough for me to drink it ! s - pungent piney hops , tropical fruits ( mango mainly ) , sweet caramel malt and a slight whiff of yeast . t - pretty spot-on with the nose . there is a strong bitterness toward the end and a bit of booziness . m - creamy and slightly sticky , with a bit higher then medium body . carbonation is nice and lively . d - definitely a sipper , the abv and bitterness sneak up on you . judging from the look and smell , i thought this would be better then it was . still a tasty brew , just no where near the big-boys in the class .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	another one of anheuser-busch , inc. piss poor beers . can anyone say rice ? a typical watery can of green beer from the `` king of crap beers .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.80	im not typically a can beer drinker . i put together a random 6 pack from total wines . ive seen this beer before , and finally decided to give it a try . it is your straight forward stout with a dark , creamy color , smoother taste , nice aroma , and that unmistakable stout taste . however , this beer is nothing to write home about . it is not bad , but it is not anything i 'll remember 5 years from now .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.50	poured from large bottle into clear glass a a basic amber appearance . one finger head remained for 30 seconds . s balanced smell of muted amber qualities . can sense higher alcohol in the smell . t strong amber , woodsy taste . m full with strong tastes , high alcohol content . d fair . the large bottle that i bought it in i could not finish . it is certainly not to be taken in multiples in my opinion . notes : i was not blown away by this beer but it is worthy of a taste , especially if you like ambers .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 1.00	this beer pours beautifully , glowing , hazed apricot amber in color with 3 fingers of fluffy froth topped by rocky peaks . retention is epic and lace coats my maredsous goblet . aroma is soft and inviting , light notes of caramel , honey , dried hay , lemon candy , spiced yeast , and herbs . subtle , but nice . flavor is creamy malt sweetness upfront with soft fruity tones accentuated by dried grass , lemon custard , fruity yeast , biscuits drizzled with honey , and light hop bitterness in the form of grassy herbals and floral tones . body is just below medium , very creamy teaxures , with a thirst quenching and highly quaffable nature . this pairs exceptionally with the spicey vietnamese noodle bowl i made for dinner . i could easily drink this by the bucket .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	two parts rusted orange peel to one part brick red , a color that is much more attractive than my description would suggest . the tight-bubbled crown is an equally intriguing hue . think toasted marshmallows dipped in orange juice . thick sheets of finely dotted lace put the finishing touches on this fantastic looking doppelbock . foam meltage and beer warming are the aroma 's only fighting chance , because it 's pretty close to absent right after the pour . other than the slightest whiff of earthy munich malt , there 's a whole lotta nothin ' emanating from the glass . average is eventually ( and barely ) achieved . first impressions include ... not enough malt , not enough of the darker malts , and a bit too much alcohol . none of those are deal breakers , but they effectively keep the flavor score from the next highest number . might things shake out differently once most of the '750 ' is gone ? sure . is it likely ? probably not . the best doppelbocks ( in my opinion ) are those that favor the caramel or even chocolate region of the malt spectrum . lighter versions , those that are heavy on earthy , toasted and nutty flavors , like this one , do n't appeal to me nearly as much . collaborator 's flavor profile consists of well-toasted french bread crust , light brown sugar , earthy tobacco , peanut skins and a few drops of orange oil . it is n't a bad combination of flavors , it just is n't the sort of thing that floats my sailing vessel . malty beer lovers should lap it up , though . the thing that keeps this doppelbock interesting , and keeps drinkability on the high side , is a surprising amount of hoppiness . warrior and mt . hood do a good job of providing both bitterness and flavor . for whatever reason , appreciable alcohol is now awol . the body/mouthfeel is *almost* lagerilicious . it 's as silky as the day is long , but is too light and does n't have enough 'hang on ' to be considered special . i have no problem at all with the laid back carbonation . even though wild dog collaborator is n't my sort of beer does n't mean it is n't a worthwhile purchase . in the end , the brewers at flying dog should have either trusted their own judgment or should have chosen better collaborators .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50 0.50	watery yellow color . sweet smell of corn and hops . flavor is not too awful , watery and slightly bitter . felt ok in the mouth , respectable . slightly drinkable , and refreshing in a strange way . if you must drink malt liquor , make yours a mickey 's grenade . it 's by far the best one out there . just be careful how many you have , it 's a doozy .

1.00 0.20 0.90 0.80 0.80	a nice dark orange with lovely carbonation strings running through . the head is big , small bubbles below , big ones in the middle and a nice cream dome on top . stays quite thick until the end . left the yeast in the bottle . the smell is quite sour . alcohol , honey , citrus , even a bit vomit like . the taste is quite light and fresh . malt , alcohol , hops , citrus , caramel , bread chocolate , hop , oranges and alcohol aftertaste with a slimy feeling . a tasty beer with a nice taste pallet . but it lacks a bit of character ut vivat , crescat , floreat !

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.60	pours an opaque honey golden with some white head that does not last . aroma is not strong , but has a good citrus component , and is typical of a witbier . flavor is mainly wheaty and has orangy hints . this is a typical `` white '' beer , refreshing and smooth .

0.80 0.20 0.50 0.40 0.40	my fiance picked up a growler of this for me when she was back in bloomington visiting some old college friends . that 's why i 'm marrying her ... she buys me beer ( she knows the way to my heart ) . a - big three finger loose tan head over a dark brown purplish brew . the head reduces quickly to about half a finger , leaving a brown collar and a very large amount of creamy lace on the glass.. s - whoa ... .way off base . this smells funky , mouldy . i smell mushrooms and , i swear to god ... .dog shit . i 'm not trying to be mean , but i really can pick up some hints of dogie poop . their lines must be bad or something ... .surely it is n't supposed to smell like this . t - ok , much better than the smell . lightly malty with some weird toast and mushroom flavors and a big out of place citrus hop note . as i work my way through the glass , i 'm actually starting to like the earthy mushroomy nuances . weird , but not so bad . m - medium bodied with a low level of carbonation . slightly acidic with a sourish neutral finish . d - this is about the worst smelling beer ever , but if you can drink it without breathing through your nose , it 's not terrible .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.70	on tap at brouwers in seattle in proper glassware ( surprising ) . i 'm not a van steenberge fan , but had to give this one a try as i 'd never heard of it , let alone had it before . primary aroma for me is the metal content of the water , mixed with some cherry and alcohol . it 's water profile reminds me a lot of st. bernardus . taste is similar , with the alcohol taking the lead , especially as it warmed . a little too astringent , with no malt character to back it up which leads too a very thin body made more so by watery carbonation . no doubt about this beer 's strength though , as you 'll feel it almost immediately . at the end of the day , a typically one dimensional van steenberge beer , therefore , not atrocious , but nowhere near the price you 'll inevitably pay anywhere outside of belgium .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	this beer reminded me an awful lot of duvel , but niot quite as good . poured to a highly carbonated golden yellow , with thick pilowy white head that lasted the entire beer , and left excellent lacing . aroma was floral with hints of grass and citrus . flavor was a very good hodge-podge of many flavors..floral , grassy , some fruit , hint of spice and yeast . left a very good , smooth finish . not necessarily my favorite style , but this was a damn good beer .

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	5/21/2011 bottle opened by me , thanks . this was a slow foamer . it did n't quite gush , but the foam was rising slowly and would have overtaken the top of the bottle had i not started pouring it into the snifter . a : the beer is a nebulous orangeish brown with a small bubbly head . not much else to report on the appearance . you now have ample information . s : a healthy dose of dates and a not insubstantial guava presence do credit to the marron acidifie . the dates and guava really compliment one another , which is somewhat surprising to me . i detect notes of plum , currant , and prune , as well as oak and vanilla . the beer is certainly sour in a lactic way , but it retains balance . there 's a touch of cherry and a little leather , with a moderate acetic presence . t : the flavor matches the aroma in excellence . lactic sourness is at a moderate level , mingling with a moderate acetic acidity . date and guava strike an excellent balance , complimenting one another at every turn . the flavor is piquant , bringing me back for sip after sip . there 's a bit of buttery oak that reminds me of chardonnay . notes of plum and currant are evident , as well as a touch of vanilla and a dash of leather . alcohol is very well hidden for 9 % , providing warming but almost no flavor . m : the beer is medium in body with lower moderate carbonation . the mouthfeel is dry , sticky , tannic , and smooth . overall : this is great stuff . i enjoyed it slightly more than the tap sampling i had of marrn acidifi . highly recommended .

1.00 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.70	12 oz bottle , bottled on jan 2006 . pours an opaque black with brown highlights with a creamy dark brown head that quickly goes to a thin film . the aroma is musty , sweet , slightly sour fruitiness and vinous alcohol . the flavor is a big burst of extremely sweet candy-like sugar that dominates . there 's some slight sharp alcohol ( but it is rather well hidden by all the sweetness ) , and also some dark fruits . a little roasted bitterness tries to pop its head out at the end , but is quickly smothered by sugars . as it warms , more alcohol and anise comes out . the mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation . overall , this definitely did n't live up to the hype . it 's drinkable but way too out of balance with all the sugary sweetness . way too much for me .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.60	appearance - 2.0 pours a very pale straw with 1 finger of quickly disipating head . visible carbonation due to its very transparent nature . smell - 2.0 slight rice small and a hint of hops . taste - 2.5 bland taste akin to its smell . nothing bad , small hops and rice taste . mouthfeel - 3.0 thin , good amounts of carbonation . nothing stellar , nothing bad . drinkability - 3.0 for what it is it is easy to drink . goes down quite easily . overall - 2.4 there are better macro lagers , there are worse . i put it slightly below average because of its bland taste . not my `` pint '' of tea but nothing bad .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.70	a - pours black with a creamy tan head that dissipates fairly quickly to a thin , but dense , covering . good amount of lacing left behind . s - chocolate and roasted malt with a hint of smoke . aroma is lighter than expected . t - flavor is good at first . good strength of coffee and hops , but fades quickly into nothing . finishes clean with a slight hop bitterness . m - feels lighter and more watery than expected . about medium body when swallowed , but feels lighter in the mouth . light carbonation is a good level . d - this is very easy to drink . very light for an imperial stout . i like the flavor , but it really needs to be punched up a couple of notches imo to meet expectations .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.60	pours a reddish copper color with a nice off white head with decent lacing . the nose is shugga , sweet malts , caramel , molasses . the taste is sweet malts up front followed directly with bitter hops , shugga , caramel , subtle dark fruits like dark cherries , subtle red apple . light to medium bodied , medium to low carbo . american barleywine ? i think so ...

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80	a : pours a very dark ruby color , almost looks brown until the light hits it . topped with a very nice frothy tan head . s : big big dark fruits here . plum , cherry , fig , date , and raisin dominate all equally . t : big , delicious , malty beer . all the scents are present in the taste with the added sweetness of brown sugar and molasses . m : heavy-bodied with generous carbonation , maybe too much , defiantly a sipping beer . d : very low , its just too heavy and thick to have a lot .

0.40 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.70	this one pours out with a kind of thin head , even pouring pretty vigorously , and not hazy , and that 's what i expect from a hefe . the color is incredibly pale , and the head dies fast - leaving only a little bit of lacing . the smell is really , really great . almost dominated by cloves , but the banana sweetness reaches in along with some peppery spiciness . i could n't expect much more from a hefe smell , but i think the lackluster head is really hurting the presence of the smell . the taste is sort of dominated by overripe banana flavors . there 's a kind of chewy wheat flavor , without much of the spiciness of the nose . kind of reminds me of a banana milkshake , or candy , almost artificial , then the spiciness kicks in just as you swallow . there 's an herbal flavor , light on the clove and pepper , pretty nice , but i think it could be much better . the mouthfeel is nice , not too sharp on the carbonation , really chewy ( as i said before ) , full , but not heavy . a nice refreshing . this one drinks pretty well . quickly , kind of smoothly . but i really did n't find it as enjoyable as some of the best hefes . a decent attempt , but kind of falls short of its german counterparts .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.40 0.50	good if you want the standard tropical knockoff of a bavarian pilsen . of course , costa rica was populated by a lot of german immigrants , and it shows that they did what they could with the local ingredients and climate . more flavor and alcohol than the imperial , and a little more head and color as well , but the differences were minor . its a bud/miller thing between the two . just order whatever the bar specializes in . you will find them mostly interchangeable .

0.40 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.50	a- pours a deep brown color with no head at all . a handful of bubbles that 's all . s- smell is toffee and caramel malts , oak , vanilla , and bourbon . t- big bourbon with just a touch of malts and a bit of oak . i really like the bourbon . m- full in body and no carbonation . d- i enjoyed the big bourbon taste but it was incredibly hard to drink , as it was pretty much flat . not sure if i got a bad bottle or what . i 'll come back to this one some time but until then not really impressed with this one .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.50	notes from the 2002 kerstbierfestival , essen , belgium . black beer , thin off-white lace . herbal , black currant aroma with some liquorice . lightly carbonated with a coarse mouthfeel . fruity , a bit juicy , dry , chocolate , caramel and notes of raw honey . prickly herbal spice with a bitter finish that 's dry and leafy ... thin , too . not too impressed by this offering ...

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.60	poured from the bottle , the deep cover appears more of an amber color than brown . the head settles to a 1/8 or 1/16 '' lacing of tiny off white bubbles . there is no haze to this beer , and the bubbles are clearly visible streaming to the top . the smell is of light , sweet carmel malts . the beer starts off with sweet carmel malts as well , about half way through the first sip the carbonation hits the tongue and adds the slightest hint of a kick to bittering hops . very slight . the finish is smooth , sweet , and coats the mouth nicely . this is one of your average microbrew beers . clearly well above any macro lager , yet obviously is n't aiming for complexity . it is a simple beer , but it does it 's job well . a bit light for a brown , but i 'm not complaining .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.40 0.40	no date on bottle , poured into a shaker pint ( hard pour ) . forms a white head of medium and large bubbles that falls away leaving a lot of net like lacing on the glass . beer is amber and relatively clear . carbonation is moderate to low with large bubbles . looks like an amber ale . aroma is small perhaps a hint of caramel . eh ... beer is thin and watery . kind of a lingering sweetness like a dilute kvass . there is some notes of caramel in the mouth but overall its not pleasant .

0.60 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	a : a new penny copper , with about a finger high head of white ... retention is poor , receding quickly to a little lip of lace ringing around the glass . s : hops make up the nose with a very light malt backbone . rather floral , pine , herbal . t + m : quite a piney hop flavour , with a body providing a perfect feel for the taste . the quick bittering builds and opens out over the tongue , becoming quite pungent before calming and finishing with on a nice note . just the tiniest balance of maltiness comes through , just about right . d : a bigger one , though the alcohol heat is not noticable on my palate . a nice hop-fix for a quiet evening - or maybe a good choice for being a little more rowdy !

1.00 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.60	a big thanks to the gentleman for this one . a : this pours pitch black . a large tan head ( over two fingers forms ) with great retention . as the foam gently recedes , sticky spiderweb looking lace is left all the way down my snifter . s : a huge roasted malt flavor over takes the nose . lots of chocolate , toffee , and coffee . some warming booze as well . this smells wonderful . t : bitter dark chocolate at first . some sweet toffee flavors and roasted malt . also plenty of alcohol . astringent and oxidized as well . m/d : a medium to full body . low on the carbonation end . kind of vinegary . even after a year of aging there is a ton of warming alcohol . though it is a very nice beer to sip on . not my favorite of the dr series or the style . though , if you can still get your hands on some in a trade , it is worth a try .

0.90 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.60	kudos to these guys for making such a fine looking beer . great head , elegant lace , interesting to look at . after that just a regular macro style-rip ground out by the big boys trying to get a piece of the micro-styled market . some chalkiness and chocolate like you 'd expect from the style , but understated . thin mouthfeel . slightly boozy nose without any of the other stuff you 'd expect from a brew of this type . drinkable but uninspired . too subdued .

0.50 0.70 0.90 0.90 0.90	very little head that dissipated very quickly . very dark brown . heavy malts , but sweet with definite coffee smell taste is heavy coffee with sweet malts and a bit of roasty to a bitter hop finish . very nice . it 's balanced and still complex . it 's got some bitterness from the malts too . mouth and drink are both really good . i could drink a few . there is some bitter astringent in the finish , but not much .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	i 've had this in both large bottle `` growler '' and the new 12oz bottles . either way this is a solid , if not spectacular , example of the style . slightly hazy and mild amber in color you can almost see the hops coming . rolls onto the palate with a zesty helping of hops , balanced nicely with fruits and finishes smooth . if you 're a fan of ipa 's this one is worth a shot .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.50 0.80	a- my bottle was labeled as `` casa beer '' . it pours a very clear light golden color . the head is thick at first but very fizzy and quickly disappears into a ring around the glass . really no lacing to speak of . the carbonation appears to be plentiful as well . s- sweet malts are on the forefrunt , but that 's about all it has going for it . it otherwise smells of dried grass/grain , slightly metallic , and kind of bland . t- pretty much tastes the way it smells ... .somewhat metallic flavor , some sweetness from the malts , and grainy . there is some slight grassy/herbal notes as well . not very complex at all and reminds me of a bland american macro . m- carbonation is heavy as anticipated , with lots of zing on the palate . the body is light , which is fine , it 's just not anything spectacular . i guess it 's refreshing and if it reminds me of anything , it 's of grains ! d- i 'm trying hard to find something positive about this beer and this is it ... it 's easy to drink because it 's quite bland and well carbonated . i would think this would be a suitable beer brewed from an african country where it 's hot all the time , as this would go down easy on summer afternoon ! i do n't think i 'll go out of my way to get this again however .

1.00 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	amazingly slow head cascade action . strange patches of bubbles throughout body of beer . deep dark rich amber coloration . clear from yeast or other floaties . fat 2 inch head that 's dark brown and leaves a nice happy trail . from cold the beer smells much like a low alcohol brown ale . how they pulled that off , i do not know . when it gets warmer notes of almond , plunm , raisin , and a leather malt sweetness appear . you have to keep your nose well-tuned to smell the alcohol , but you 'll surely taste it on the palate . there 's a little too much of liquid raisin / heavy caramel thing going on here . they decieve well with the high abv but the sweetness borders on the cloying : i 'd want no more than one . the mouthfeel is also a bit lacking for the style .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70	i expected better from st. bernardus and pierre celis , really . a - probably too dark to be a true `` wit . '' the beer looks like a less-carbonated hefeweizen . it 's light-medium brown , cloudy , and with a minimal amount of frothy head . s - very nice . honey , candy , spices . this smells like a persian pastry or perhaps an indian dessert . t - honey . sweet , creamy , definitely more candy-like than most wits , and not at all tart . perhaps this would be different if i had put a slice of lemon or orange in the glass , but it 's quite sweet and almost dessert-like by itself . m - creamy . luxurious . i do n't know what yeast they use , but the combination of that strain as well as what i assume is a judicious amount of rolled oats makes this the most milk-shaky low gravity beer i can think of . velvety . very nice . d - i would liken this beer 's drinkability to chocolate milk . it 's sweet and thick , but somehow you still want to down it .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.80	always good to see beers aged on wood . they are the best ! beautiful pour , orangish tan with a perfect beige head . lace down the glass ! nose has candy malts , bitter hops and oak . taste has nice piney hops up front and through the finish . well balanced by malts and wood . medium body well carbonated . nice ipa .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	22oz bottle purchased ( i assume ) at lonehill liquor . shared by azagthoth . i do n't know who labeled this as a double stout but i really do n't agree with that label . pours a dark red color , very murky , small head , low retention , some lacing . aroma is of roast , caramel , cherry , and pale malt . flavor definitely has some roast and some dark cherry elements to it . medium bitterness . the best way to describe this beer is really american strong ale blended with belgian strong dark ale . i also detect some elements of a scotch ale in there . body is medium . co2 is slightly low . drinkable and enjoyable . just do n't expect this to taste like a `` american double / imperial stout '' .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.90	stunning appearance . pours a clear reddish brown with a big and tight tan head . great retention as it slowly recedes to a one finger cap and leaves sheets of lace behind . looks similar to fresh poured iced tea . mellow and muted aroma with hints of toasted & roasted malt , some nuttiness , and amber malt extract . flavor is very mellow with some toasted malt , nuttiness , and chicory . a little toasted grain hits the back of the tongue . hops are barely present , adding just enough bitterness to balance . finishes clean and dry . overall the flavor is very mild . light in body , low carbonation , and incredibly smooth . goes down very easily . a real session beer that has just enough to keep you interested . not a bad choice for gameday .

0.20 0.20 0.30 0.30 0.20	going through my mixed 10 pack , i had to take the bullet and try this random beer at some point ... a - the beer pours the palest of yellows - i 'm talking lighter than straw . pour head retention s - smells like limp broccoli and cleaning products . yum . t - what little flavor it has recalls creamed corn and chlorinated water i generally have tried to avoid letting it stay in my mouth , i may have to chug it to avoid tasting any more . m - carbonated , this is probably worse than mgd . fact . d - who made this beer ? god this is a miserable experience . i know i 'm supposed to be constructive , but this such a lazy beer that i do n't think it 's worthy of much thought put into it . it 's a poor excuse for a beer . sorry , guys .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.70	bottle : poured a clear deep back color stout with large light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing . aroma of light dry black bitter chocolate with some light coffee . taste is an easy going mix between some light black bitter chocolate , some roasted malt and some very subtle coffee . body is lacking some creamy texture with great carbonation . not bad overall but lacking in character .

0.60 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.90	small craft warning is a hazy golden lager with a somewhat diminishing , soft and splotchy , white head . the aroma is strong in the hops department . it is piny , wooden and fruity ... like orange . it 's strong but soft . it is medium bodied , very smooth and has a clean finish . it has a very full taste from the grain up to the hops . the bitterness is well-managed . the flavor becomes slightly sweet as the flavor progresses . excellent flavor . it 's so bright and brassy ! yes ! ( rated aug 10 , 2007 )

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.20 0.80	within the rank of the cheap beers in my country it is good , but nothing has to do with the presentation that cerveceria cuauhtemoc vendia for 20 years , has not been leaving much undertow its appearance is clear , smell acceptable , taste awful , drinkability good .

1.00 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.80	poured into my great lakes christmas ale snifter . i was excited to see this at my local heinen 's after just recently reading that is many ba 's favorite and most drinkable sour . i had no idea it was even around here , as i 'd never seen it before today . appearance - three full fingers of unstable and clumpy froth appear right away . watching the head dissipate is like watching a collapsing foam building . it just has a very unique structure to it . the liquid itself is deep brown with slight hints of crimson and amber . very impressive lacing . smell - smells very sour . i am most used to jolly pumpkin sours , so i have to say it smells similar to most of them ; specifically bam biere . strong hints of cherry with slight citrus . smells slightly sweet and extremely acidic . taste - definitely sweeter than the smell lead me to believe . it is sour as it first touches my tongue , but as i swallow i am smacked with a sack of cherries . this is the most amazing cherry beer i 've ever tasted . there is definitely some light lemongrass swaying in the background as well . a slight sour pucker on the finish.cherry and pomegranate really dominate the mouth here . mouthfeel / drinkability - now that i look at other ba 's reviews , i have to disagree with many of the other statements that this beer is too sweet . i believe it to be very well balanced all through-out . sourness and sweetness are sort of playing tug-of-war with each other , and sometimes sour wins ; sometimes sweet . it just depends on each certain drink to me . not nearly as sour as i expected . quite light bodied as well . while the beer is resting in my mouth , i get the feeling that i am going to be overcome by sweetness when i swallow . but when i do , i am pleasantly surprised each and every time i take a drink .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 1.00	pours hazy light brown with some orange tints . great head and great lacing . the aroma of cloves , wheat and citrus fruits . the taste was of wheat , cloves , malts and banana hints.there were also the fruit notes that went so well with the overall taste.nice feel to this beer.smooth and rich , yet carbonation was moderate with a medium body.some yeast in the finish.what good balance ! notes : great pick and to me this was a treat.i will buy a six pack next time.excellent .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.60	poured from a bomber into a snifter a - exceptional ! dark , almost ruby like color when held up to the light . the head is light , tan , but with enough substance to hold it 's own throughout and leave some thick lacing on the side . s - complex but not completely there yet . it smells young , but that 's to be expected . some piney notes and over ripe citrus dominate at first followed by a hint of dark fruit and a rich caramel and malt finish . i can feel the burn of the alcohol in my nostrils . m - medium carbonation , medium body with a dry finish and a pretty good bit of warmth from the alcohol t - pretty good balance of hop bitterness and malt sweetness but the alcohol is way too aggressive right now . picking up some apple peel and bitter unripe citrus . i was expecting some more fruity esters after reading some reviews . it falls flat in the taste category but still good enough to finish by myself . d - not very drinkable right now . should mellow out in a year or so . i 'm going to lay some down for a while and review six months and one year from now .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	from bottle barn in santa rosa . a - pours a rich caramel mahogany with a white 2-fingered head . does n't really dissipate and leaves nice lacing . s - caramel , light roast coffee , and brett . t - caramel , light roast coffee , hop bitterness , and a slightly bretty flavor . m - creamy , well-balanced , and very light . d - good , very easy to drink , but nothing special .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	liquid is a dark amber topped with a thick finger of brown foam and dense and substantial lacing . carbonation is also very prevalent , making this model stand out much more than previous years . visually stunning . scents of cinnamon , nutmeg , gingerbread , cayenne pepper and grandma 's fruit cake are all on hand , as is a blunt dryness brought on by the sugar and yeast . flavor profile packs in a ton of plum , which is followed by subtle maple notes and a dry conclusion . spicing seems to be the usual ; think nutmeg , cinnamon and pine needles . beer is smooth , but not rich , allowing some nice roasted aspects to linger on the tongue . this model has a bigger aroma and flavor profile than the previous year and that 's certainly reflected in the amount of time it took to drink the 12oz bottle ( you could count the minutes on one hand ) . another great version of america 's best christmas ale .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.50	pours a deep mahogany brown , not quite black but damn close . even with an extremely hard pour there was only a handful of bubbles that formed . what little bubbles did exist stuck decently to the glass but hardly what i would call lacing . smell is odd , to say the least . lots of dark fruits , almost sour but not quite . very light acrid roast aroma mixed in with the fruits . the combination is not pleasant but not all together bad either . taste is better with less of the dark fruits and a little bit more chocolate . the roast is n't as bitter as the smell would make you think . it 's actually not that bad by itself but that aroma sticks around and in this particular glass it is focused to my nose which just makes it worse and somewhat difficult to enjoy the good flavors . thinner body with light , but very much present , carbonation . i would like this to be a tad bit thicker as an oatmeal stout but it 's not bad at all . overall , i might try this again down the road , it 's a bit different but not really bad . as it is though , if i want an oatmeal stout i will probably go elsewhere .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.80	dave 's brewfarm the bruiser , smoked malt scotch ale . dusky brown appearance , with ruby highlights at the edges , very slim and soon gone head , nothing to speak of . aroma : yep , there 's the smoked malt , there 's the bacon-y feel , no , more like salmon , actually . with dark malt below that . tasting it : bitter hit at first , bracing blast that mellows a bit , all is calm some caramel malt feel comes in . smoke remains king , however . and it 's damned tasty . also , boozy , ... halfway in it 's ringing loud and proud . tasting it , delicious . really , honestly , yum , yum , yum . smoked malt meets sweet malt , and it all comes together in beautiful harmony . what 's in a name ? i ai n't bruised ... yet . nobody bruised me ... lately . oh , wait ... but , oh , i like drinking this , i love tossing this down my ol ' gullet . it 's the 3-time punch :

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70	poured from short bottle into chimay chalice huge , long lasting head with large bubbles over a golden brown color . perfect dubbel look . spicy clove aroma . bright flavor with lots of spice . clove , cinnamon , with a tad of smoke . it was good and seemed right on for a dubbel , but the spice was a bit to dominant and seemed to lack much depth . very sharp , carbonated , and biting mouthfeel . low point for this beer . no problem drinking this beer , but almost seemed a bit harsh to overcome the mouthfeel .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90 0.80	one beautiful looking barleywine here . it almost glows a nice dark amber color . smells both hoppy and malty with that familiar barleywine aroma of sweet malts and fruit as well . bigtime grapefruit on the front end with a nice smooth parlay into a sweet malt on the finish . i loved this barleywine a lot . i actually think it 's every bit as good as old ruffian and bigfoot . it 's widely available to me too . awesome ...

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	bottled on 7 january 2011 . a : black , opaque , with dense creamy tan head s : mild to medium nose , more spritzy carbonation than anything , slight roasted malt evident t : decent black saison , definite bubblegum and yeast taste , not as clean as i 'd like , somewhat metallic-sharp taste in body , almost reminds me of an average tasting extract homebrew m : medium bodied , good roasted malt but sharp , metallic bitter finish that makes it slightly unbalanced in taste o : not what i 'd expect from goose island for balance and representation of the style

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	comes out of the tap a rich opaque warm sable with a thick , fine-bubbled , almost guinness-like light tan head that leaves some good lacing . aroma has chocolate , coffee and smoky tones with a hint of licorice . flavor is like mocha , quality coffee and chocolate with a smoky tone and hints of licorice and caramel . texture is smooth , tingly and thick , leaving a satisfying finish . let this one hammer you !

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	pours dark black , with a miniscule quickly vanishing head , reminds me of coca-cola . not very impressive . smells of hops , a hint of nuts , and a bit of carmel/coffe malt blend . interesting malt blend is apparent , and very enjoyable , a slight hint of hops on the back stretch . mouthfeel is very nice and creamy , with a touch of carbonation . drinkability on this beer is definatley a four , it would be a 4.5 if it wernt for the carbonation , as it detracts from the creaminess .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.60 0.70	a : this is a very beautiful looking beer . the head is absolutely amazing , with perfect color and form . it laces like cream on the glass . the color is a very dark brown or black , depending on how much light is on it . s : this has a mellow caramel scent , with some hints of roasted grains and some slight notes of coffee . it 's not a very powerful , complete smell though . t : it 's well balanced on the actual flavors , with a coffe-like flavor to it , and some sweetness like dark chocolate . it has a very light bitterness from the grains , but i get nothing from the hops . the overall impression of the flavor is that it is a bit weak , but because every flavor sits equally in balance , it is average . m : these types of beers are n't always full-bodied , but i still feel that it is a bit too light . the carbonation is very good , which wins it points , and it coats very well . o : overall , this beer is a bit weak for my tastes . not accounting for personal taste though , it is a pretty good schwarzbier . in germany you 'll find a much richer beer because the flavors tend to stand out a bit more . i feel that when it is fresh , the body is a little more pronounced , and that could be why this one seemed a little weak .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	12oz straight from the bottle . nice green bottle with a lively carbonation and thin lace . smelled of faint grains and floral hops . light , tight bodied just like a harsh malt liquor . very clean taste , not sweet but subtle twangy notes with a good kick of hops . very crisp . very unique . most imports ca n't touch it , simply because it 's from china and it will mix great on chinese food . i choose ramen myself . not a type i would normally drink .

0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90 1.00	just wow ... .how did i go this long without trying this stuff ? maybe the packaging turned me off or something . a . big white head and a lightly on the yellow side amber color . not many bubbles in there . nothing special here . s. there is a some malt ( kinda of a bready smell ) . there is a nice citrusy fruity aroma as well . i just ca n't put how much like this to words . t. citrus . hops that are on the sour side if that makes sense or maybe there 's another flavor in here . finishes with some sour flavor and some bready malt touch . this is a very unique taste unlike anything i 've had , and it 's just an apa ? m. though you ca n't see bubbles , but there is plenty of carbonation . odds are this is thicker than it feels because of the carbonation effect , but still wonderful . d. i really could down a 6er of this . it begs to be consumed . this is truly a special beer . it 's too bad the bro 's consider appearance so highly . this is without a doubt a solid a beer .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.90	pours dark mahogany with a thick tan head . nutty , smoky aroma with smoe caramel . the taste is phenomenal . toasty malts and buttescotch with a hint of bittersweet chocolate . finish is creamy and sweet . one of the first scotch ales iv'e had and easily one of the best . just an awesome beer .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	acquired from dunt via support your team bif so a big thank you goes out to him ! poured in to a pint glass . a : this beer pours a nice deep , translucent , bronze color with a khaki colored sudsy head . head recedes immediately leaving no lacing to speak of . s : nose is very artificial cherry , a hint of bubble gum , and faint vanilla . t : taste just way artificial . artificial cherry , artificial vanilla . some minor hints of oak , but a crazy bubble gum flavoring mingled with artificial cherry flavoring . cloying artificial sweetness in the finish . m : lighter side of medium body , medium carbonation , some what oily and sticky in the finish . d : goes down easily , not filling , not very tasty - far too artificial flavoring in this beer . this is a one and done for me .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.80	this apa has a nice copper color and foamy head , but from there it goes downhill . there is an apparent lack of hop use leaving the palate wanting for spice and bitter . this one is more reminiscent of a light golden ale .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80	500ml bottle from derek - cheers ! light brown pour with red highlight and a voluminous foamy light tan head . good retention and some nice lacing , though the size of the head on pouring does make me concerned that this has carbonation issues ( thankfully it does n't ) . earthy aroma of stale coffee grounds , nuts and eggshell . flavour is classic alt , but a little weak in part due to a lack of substance in the body . nuts mingle with earth and an eggshell bitterness . underlying brown breadiness slowly comes to dominate , and a grassiness begins to emerge in the finish . what really brings this one down is a seriously underpowered mouthfeel , which comes off feeling light and watery . its too bad really , because with a little bit more bulk i think it could let the flavour shine . fix the body and we 'd have a great alt . as it stands , it 's a pleasant pairing with dinner , but not something i 'd recommend hunting down .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.50 0.60	so dark you could hide a black sheep in it . a mound of foam tapers over the top of my glass . roasted chocolate malts , and sweet taro root build a tasty nose . the flavor is that of an incredibly basic stout . maltiness is dark and delicious , hint of coffee , cocoa and caramel as well . light body , medium fizz to it . overall it seems like the marketing males this beer more than the beer itself . cute labeling , special bottle , and usda organic slapped on it make it stick out yet it yields something akin to canadian made guinness .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.70	lucky kat ipa appearance : this beer pours a crystal clear amber orange with bright red highlights . the head is nearly non-existent with only a thin white lacing around the sides of the glass . smell : for an ipa this beer has little to no hop aroma . instead , there is a slight caramel malt character with a hint of spicy undertones . deep in the back of the aroma is a minute character of fresh peeled lemons . there is a slight fruity ester which actually reminds me of a nice english bitter . taste : there is a slight caramel malt sweetness followed by only a minute spicy hop character . the only other notable hop characteristic is a distinct lingering , borderline harsh , high alpha hop bitterness . this coupled with the slight alcoholic warming makes for an unexciting and one dimensional finished . mouthfeel : this beer is extremely thin with a light to mild carbonation . the light body of this beer makes it easy to pitch back , but definitely not as full as i would expect from most ipa 's . drinkability : the light mouth feel of this beer coupled with the mild flavors makes it fairly drinkable . i pitched back quite a few from the six pack i bought in one night and they went down smoothly throughout the evening . overall impression : this beer just does n't have a lot going on . i would not say it is a bad beer , but it lacks the characteristic citrus and floral aroma and flavor that i find so enjoyable in my ipa 's . the saving grace of this beer is the fact that it 's easy to drink and goes down smooth . however , i doubt most people looking for an ipa want to pitch back a light and un-complex beer . get it to try once , but do n't look for it to solve your quest for the perfect american ipa hop bomb . ; )

0.20 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.30	yeah baby . the first malt liquor i ever tasted . light yellow . non-offensive , well hidden alcohol aroma with hints of corn and pear . yes , its full of corn and its fairly grainy , but there isnt really anything in this that makes it intolerable . no off flavors whatsoever . ill be honest , i finished all forty ounces and im proud of it . this was much better than the keystone light that i had later in the evening .

1.00 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	a mellow , almost cask-like brew with a plush , graceful mouthfeel . this roasted porter is full-bodied and relaxed and delivers no sharp edges or stray elements . toasted grains combine with a slight hint of marshmallow to produce an intriguing aroma . the light , frothy head is formed of variably sized bubbles to create an almost dirty appearance while trailing gobs of ocean spray lace . the taste is rounded and leaves a breath of smoke on the exhale . mellow is the key operative here .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50 0.50	12 oz . bottle from cost plus `` winter brews '' mix pack . appearance : hazy straw-orange color with a thin head which dissipated quickly , lingering at the edges . smell : strong pumpkin pie spice aroma with some bready malt notes . taste : very slight bitterness with a hint of spice , taste not as strong as aroma would indicate . slightly sour ( intentional ? ) mouthfeel : ciderlike acidity lends a dry mouthfeel . light body with moderate carbonation . drinkability : easy drinking compared to some highly spiced pumpkin beers . not sure if the acidity was intended but that would probably limit me to one of these .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.70	a - pours a hazy orange brown color with a light creamy head and moderate carbonation . the color does n't bother me at all but i 've never known a lager to be anyhing but clear . s - caramel , toffee , candy sugar , light sugary floral aroma , and a little bready . had i not read the label , i would swear this is a belgian style as opposed to german . t - mimics the nose with lightly toasted caramel toffee , bready malt , and a moderate amount of floral citrus bitterness . taste is fairly constant throughout the sip and midway through the 9 % alcohol starts to peek through . the malt sweetness and hops provide a slight tang . m - medium body that 's a little chewy , carbonation is sprightly on the tongue . o - this is a weird one . i read terrapin 's description of the beer `` making this beer with no rules , rhyme or reason , we created a beer that was not meant to fit in , to be fit in , or squeezed into a particular style . this lager will challenge your beer drinking pallet and put a smile on your beer drinking face ! `` , i think they accomplished their goal . the palette challenge with this one is it does n't fit into any particular style , it makes me scratch my head after a half a bomber , and i throw my hands up in frustration and then enjoy the rest of the glass . why bother ... it 's different and unique and after all , that 's what makes it so fun with this beer ... why conform ? because they give it a lager title , i give this a b ; for creativity purposes , if they would n't have given it a lager label , i would have rated it higher .

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.50	a - dark honey color but very clear . tall creamy near white head . s - sweet fruit , caramel and a touch of belgian yeast . t - prune , caramel and toasted oak . m - a bit thin with just a hint of tingle . o - not bad , but i would probably not buy it again .

0.30 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.50	a - gold with a slight pinkish tint . a one finger head that vanished very quickly into nothingness . very clear with only a few scattered rising bubbles . s - smells like blueberry pancakes with some metals ( tin and nickel ) underneath . t - tastes like an artificial blueberry pancake seltzer water would taste . the aftertaste is lightly bitter and lingers with artificial blueberry sweetness and some bland grain . it is n't terrible , just weird . m - a thin brew , slick and oddly drying . it feels like it should refresh , but it dessicates the whole mouth . d - it is n't hard to drink . the flavor is n't strong so it could even be sessioned . all around bland and uninspired . well maybe it was inspired by instant blueberry pancakes .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.30	it is the worse beer than i have proven in my life , its flavor to rice , also lets much flavor to me to sugar i do not recommend it , all the beers of anheuser busch know me the same thing , this beer forme not had a appeararance , smell , taste or mouthfeel .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	poured from a bottle into a shaker pint . initially there was a bit over 1/2 an inch of foam that dissipated almost instantly . additionally , no lacing was left behind with this beer . poor head in all ways . color was a black that when held to the light showed a deep garnet . nice color , but poor head . aroma was pretty bland . bit of the roasty malt in the aroma but not much else . taste was fine , nothing exceptional , but fine . bit of roast , little bit of hops and a fairly thin mouthfeel . not hoppy enough to be a schwarzbier . just a light , slightly roasty but fairly neutral beer .

0.90 0.70 0.70 0.40 0.50	750ml corked and crowned bottle , ~ $ 9 at brown jug warehouse , anchorage , ak . bottle states 7 % abv . no specific dating evident , but bottles lists it as a 10th anniversary brew , 1997-2007 . appearance : deep brown , opaque , with medium brown , dense creamy head , significant lacing in rings . very attractive . aroma : roast and chocolate dominate , little else discernible . taste : again it 's mostly roast , with a moderate taste of chocolate . distinct metallic flatness throughout , especially in the finish . fruity esters , metallic , and chocolate compete in the finish and aftertaste . mouth : moderately thick to full , slightly sweet , tingly finish . a little alcohol warmth noted . overall : an interesting , somewhat drinkable beer that would probably be quite good if not for the profound metallic taste , which makes rating it complicated . to try to be fair , i tasted the first pour in a 20 ounce ( standard shaped ) pint glass that was washed in the dishwasher , and then a second taste in a wide-bowl red wine glass that i carefully washed and completely dried by hand , to make it beeer clean , and got basically the same metallic in both . ms. warmstorage got the same thing in both tastings , without prompting from me . the metallic nature is a significant flaw , and i feel like i had to ding the beer in both taste and drinkability for it .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	not as assertive as it has been in the past , county ale is still a great ale . somewhat dry ( due , i believe , to the use of chocolate malt ) and ever so slightly smokey . has a very long finish . absolutely awesome on tap in cask conditioned format , provided the pub knows how to do this sort of thing well .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	750ml bottle into snifter on 9/24/09 . a - poured a cloudy orange-colored body with a slim , bubbly off-white head that reduced to a wispy film and a thin ring of retention , yielding sparse lace that slid down the sides of the glass . s - quite an aromatic nose with juniper berries at the forefront . the berries impart a fruity character , while leafy , tea-like hops offer a hint of bitterness . orange peel , black pepper , clove and herbal notes all mingle together quite nicely . malt character is doughy and cookie-esque . t - initial flavor is sweet and spicy with hints of black tea leaves and plenty of fruity sweetness from the berries . malt takes on a sweet , caramely charcter with a faint burnt sugar aspect . finishes with a spicy kick that suggests black pepper and earthy herbs . m - medium bodied with a syrupy texture and bristly carbonation . finishes with a lingering spiciness that camps out on the palate forever . d - i liked this more than i thought i would . this is quite an aromatic brew , and very flavorful as well . sah'tea is yet another dfh creation that pushes the boundaries of what beer can be .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured from the bottle and into a tasting snifter during a tasting of the entire crooked line series at tops . looks : labyrinthine . very very black . no head , no film , just the tiniest mocha-colored ring . smells : great . a tiny bit of bourbon , vanilla , raisins , molasses , licorice , brown sugar and a little bit of dark chocolate . very sweet . the bourbon is nicely kept in balance with the roasty aromas . tastes : sweet . lots of molasses and vanilla extract , dark chocolate , maple syrup , a bit of peanuttiness , and some vodka heat . roasted coffee beans roll in at the finish . feels : buttery . medium in body , the beer rolls around the mouth like velvet . an alcohol burn singes the tongue and throat . drinks : ambrosial . for a 13 % monster , this is crazy drinkable . it 's sweet and decadent but not too heavy . awesome . i asked for seconds and thirds , i liked it so much .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	had a pint at the ( 512 ) spring open house yesterday , at which this beer was introduced . dark-brown and cloudy in appearance , the pint glass i was handed had been pre-poured , so i ca n't say a lot about the head . the smell was nice and earthy with underlying hop notes , and the taste largely followed suit . the sweetness up front balanced nicely with the beer 's hops , and in combination with an enjoyable , full body , the pint drank easily while sitting outside the brewery on a beautiful march day . this is a tasty representative of a style i do n't often see , and i 'll look for it around town in the future .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	ty to john urlaub @ rohrbach for his e-kindness a : nice amber , with thick white head reduced and laced nicely . s : not much , sinus issues here today ... sorry ! t : nice , hoppy taste with some bitter notes , orange , creamy . m : good smooth and creamy a little bubble zing . d : nice fall beer smooth and very drinkable ... nice football beer ! i can invasion a nice steak sub going along this beer .

0.30 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.30	pours a pale straw colour with a medium white head , thins out to a ring around the top , not helped at all by weak but steady carbonation . no lacing . looks very dull . thin smell , virtually no malt . a lot of grassy hops but mostly just a soda water aroma . smells acidic , basically like carbonated water . unimpressed . the taste is revolting . it has the palate of a backwards pilsener . starts off , well , watery , while the mid-palate has bitter notes with a slight pow hoppy character , and then a thoroughly nasty lingering sweetness on the back . the flavours might be okay if the hops were at the back to truncate the sticky malt , but it 's topsy turvy and as a result leaves me syrupy and sweet . mouthfeel gets sticky at the back as well , but is not too watery , quite appropriate for the lager style . not very pleasant and not drinkable . a failure .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.50 0.50	faintly foggy kumquat with a juicy slice of tangerine along the bottom edge of the glass . an impressively dense cloud of fine yeast reminds me why i prefer the look of unfiltered beer . the pale lemon colored crown looks good as well , especially as it deflates and as it deposits gobs of sticky broken bubbles all over the damn place . given the ingredients and the specifics of the brewing process , not to mention the name , hop juice 's nose is less than spectacular . more than 4.5 lbs of hops per barrel and more than 4 weeks of dry-hopping should have resulted in more than a semi-muted citrusiness riding along on a pale malt base . yikes ! i 'm not sure what 's going on , but my first thought when beer and taste buds made contact was *turpentine* . it is n't nearly that nasty , of course , but something out of the ordinary is going on here . for one thing , there 's too much raw , unincorporated alcohol . it 's hard to tell if the funkiness is coming from malt ( rotten , barely toasted grain ) or hops ( rotten grapefruits and oranges , fermented spruce sap ) . my love for hops in general and dipas in particular does n't help in this case because hop juice is so far out of kilter that it does n't even seem like a dipa . if this was from a brewpub , i 'd suspect dirty tap lines . several dipas use hop extract ( this one uses hop pellets and whole hop flowers ) and they tasted pretty damn good . looks like this one might be the result of either a terrible recipe or a brewing mistake somewhere along the line . for what it 's worth , the hop bill is killer : warrior , columbus , centennial , amarillo , chinook , simcoe and cascade . too bad they could n't have been put to better use . there 's nothing much wrong with the body/mouthfeel . it 's medium-full and is high on sappy slickability . the next highest score might have been possible if the flavor had been halfway decent . mouthfeel is hard to divorce from taste ( if it 's less than good ) when it comes time to assign a number . left coast hop juice has a great name , spectacular looks , a decent nose and a borderline nasty flavor profile . the brewery claims to have been one of the pioneers of this particular style . if so , then i 'm glad that others set out in an entirely different direction .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	picked this up in nc & paid waay too much for this . bottled mar 31 2010 pours chestnut with a finger of tan head . minimal head retention & lacing s : sourness , cherries , leather & raspberries t : much raspberry , some tartness , oaky notes & some vinegar up front . raspberry & acidic twang mingle with oaky dryness as this warms , some vanilla/chardonnay notes hang on the edges . finishes tart , slightly sour ( cherries ) & with nice raspberry notes mf : medium bodied , slightly acidic with puckery notes a nice effort but way overpriced + $ 1.30 an ounce , really ? ?

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.80	bottle from riga pours amber with some head that soon dissipates , no lacing . aroma is sweetish malty with floral hops and slight honey , quite pleasant . aroms is similar mild floral hops with sweetish taste of honey , at the end the beer starts to feel a bit too sweet . overall , the beer is one of the best honey beers i have tried . i generally do not like honey , but in this case it was not excessive and made the beer very fresh and drinkable .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	a : pours a nice red color with a tiny bubbly head that quickly runs and hides . no lacing at all . s : malty with a caramel aroma and a whole lot of fusel alcohol . t : sweet with a strong sugary flavor . more strong alcohol presence . m : medium-bodied , sticky , and a bit fizzy . d : not bad , but the alcohol is way to noticible in this one and the carbonation is a bit annoying . worth a try perhaps .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	just had crazy ed 's chilli beer ... looking for something to put out the fire . creamy ole guinness should do it . looks pitch black with firm tan head . dense and persisent . always fascinating to watch the beer cascade over the nitro enhanced bubbles . smells unassuming of roasted grain and chocolate . a little tart . little in the way of hops or malt . tastes roasted and of bittersweet chocolate forcasts the firm malt base . body is ideally creamy albeit less full than one would expect . not as thick or rich as it looks . mouthfeel is creamy and crisp . quite refreshing for a stout . finishes a bit weak in comparison to other stouts . fairly dry finish with lingering flavors of roasted barley . this is basically the whipped cream of the beer market . could have been brewed by betty crocker . well balanced and well handled . a good stout for any time of the year .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	way way better than a tasting on tap in byron bay some 2 years ago . lovely light fluffy structure with the most delicate honey , citrus and cut grass . quite fizzy right throughout and some mild spice to finish . forget about extreme beers - some of the best stuff recently released in australia is well under 5 % .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50	16oz can courtesy of jtrockchalk into a duvel tulip . a : pours a lovely , clear reddish-amber body with three fingers of soft , pillowy cream-colored foam . terrific retention and lots of lace . stunning . s : full , round , balanced aroma of grassy hops and caramel malt . the hops are n't as bright as i 'd like , and the malt winds up dominating . not my kind of american ipa , but not really bad , either . t : pretty much just straightforward caramel malt . a little bit of dryer , biscuity malt helps balance things out a little sweetness-wise , but the hops are almost completely relegated to a dully bitter finish . tasty enough , but far from a great example of the style . m : smooth medium body with moderate , soft , lively carbonation . nice . d : way too sweet for the style . where 's the crisp ipa bitterness ? notes : big thanks to jtrockchalk for sending this one my way . i always love a craft beer out of a can , and this was my first time trying a beer from kansas . it might be better listed as an english ipa , as the hops did n't even achieve an even footing with the powerful malts . i definitely like more hop aroma , flavor , and bitterness out of an american ipa , but this was still an enjoyable beer . cheers !

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	had a draft of this at the brewpub in warsaw . served with a fine off-white , fizzy head and no lace . was a very hazy to cloudy light amber in color . had a great traditional bavarian hefeweizen aroma and the same with flavor . lemony , sweet-tart finish . very good body and carbonation . satisfying . a well done session beer .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.80	reviewed 1/8/2008 ( bottle ) : pours a golden somewhat cloudy yellowish color . big foamy frothy white head with good lacing . very bitter , dry piney aroma . malty sweet on the end of the aroma . sweet malty taste . a little hoppy on the end . a little dry . more sweet than hoppy . warming up it 's a little more hoppy .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	2009 vintage from a 750 ml bottle . a - poured a completely black with a gigantic 3 finger head . great retention on the side of the glass . s - it smells of chocolate and bourbon . t - a big bourbon taste but it goes down smooth . also some tastes of wood . m - a little harsh at first sip but smooth after a minute or two . similar to bitches brew as that it is not heavy but is very smooth and does not taste like 11.7 % at all . this drinks so easily which is a big thing for me . d - tastes a little heavy at first sip , but it becomes completely smooth and perfect for what it is afterwards . is it worth $ 20 per bottle ? not in my opinion , but still worth trying once .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	got this at de bierkoning in amsterdam . from a bottle into a weizen glass . appearance : pours a super large 3+ finger thinner off-white head . no real carbonation evident . colour is a lighter brown , perhaps sienna or russet . actually poured relatively clear for a dunkelweizen , then quickly turned cloudy after a few seconds . head quickly dissipates into a film cap , which stays the entire time , and leaves some good lacing down the glass . smell : wheat malt and bit of sweet caramel and toffee . ok , but there 's also something a little foul there that i ca n't put my finger on . smelly shoes or something along those lines . not a fan . taste : wheat malt and not much else . a sweet caramel malt aftertaste lingers pretty long and is not all that pleasant . pretty one dimensional and boring . palate : medium body and medium carbonation . creamy smooth going down and finishes very sticky , really coating the mouth completely . a bit too sticky for me , but some might enjoy that kind of extreme . overall : looks good and feels alright , but everything else was at least disappointing and maybe even a little off . not all that enjoyable , which made it not very drinkable either . there are definitely much better examples out there . pass .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80	pours a clear amber color . short 1/5 inch head with poor retention and no lacing . smells of yeast mostly and some slight sweet malt . i guess it fits the style , but not a real good example . smooth and crisp mouth feel . high carbonation level is noticeable . tastes of slight malt , but mostly clean yeast . slight sweetness is present and a barely noticeable hop bitterness comes through . overall , the the beer gets sweeter after a few sips , but mostly a lackluster beer . kind of a boring and bland beer with very little hops .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.80	pours a not-quite-clear straw color with a small head that rapidly diminishes . smells almost sweetish . kind of a surprise . i guess the best way to describe it would be malty , some banana scent , with the tiniest hint of citrus in the aroma . taste : wheat , bananas and marshmallows ! sounds strange but that was the immediate sensation i got upon tasting this delicious beer . finish is malty-sweet with a little bit of dryness at the very end . mouthfeel : high carbonation , light bodied . drinkability : medium . it is still a little sweet to be consumed in mass quantities . however , i could kill a few pints of these in one sitting . overall : very good weiss . i will be getting more of this .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.80	a- beer pours a slightly hazy oranghe-red with a nice foamy white head that stays around for a while before settling to leave some very nice lacing . little carbonation . s- typical white ale characterstics are upfront , with orange peel and some corriander spice . behind that is the grapey , cherry characteristic that the pinot noir brings into this brew . i did n't detect any of the oak to this . t- similar to the smell . you get your typical white ale characteristics up front . sweet , with orange peel and corriander , and finsishes with the pinot noir manifesting in cherries and grapes . still no oak . dry finish . m/d- medium-light bodied , a little surprising for the abv of this beer , little carbonation . good drinkability , one to share with a friend considereing it 's potentcy and the 750ml bottle size .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pale gold and crystal clear . modest white head ( about one finger ) that becomes a thin film and then a ring . lacing is minor perhaps due to glass washed in the dishwasher . aroma is grainy with a spot of flowery hops . taste is very clean malts , with some moderately bitter euro hops . mouthfeel is good with medium carbonation . it has a mildly dry bitter finish . a perfect easy drinking summer pils .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	was at whole foods picking up some dinner . i decided to glance over their beer section & pick up something new . i remember seeing a good review about this beer at another liquor store . so i decided to try it out . visual/head- the most lavishing & inviting i 've ever seen in any beer . head was about 1 '' think tan , body was very dark brown , almost a black tone . the head seemed to fossilize itself as i let it sit for 2 minutes . smell- my first impression was the smell of coffee cake , possibly some cinnamon notes to it . 2nd was the smell of alcohol first taste-ca n't figure out which is more dominant , it 's a toss up between coffee , liquorice & cacao beans . follow by bubbling carbonation ( i think i tipped the glass to much ) then the taste of alcohol . 2nd taste- coffee & liquorice seems to be the taste i 'm getting . also the weight is pretty thick & lightly carbonated . as i 'm letting it sit in my mouth i can now taste some of what i think is malt & very little hop . following sips-now i 'm a few sips & gulps pass the half way mark of my glass . this drink is thick with very little carbonation to it . the taste of malt & alcohol is starting to kick in . carbonation dies out as the beer thaws to room temperature . final sips- as the coffee & malt croaks , seems like the liquorice carrys on it 's duty in this stout . drinkability- charmingly thick . coffee & liquorice is the governing body in this drink . -this would go great with a hamburger . i will definitely rotate this beer in regularly.now i really want a hamburger !

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	goose island 's matilda pours to be an opaque orange/yellow color . it reminds me of the color of a tangarine or perhaps even wet maple 2x4 . there was a head on this brew when i poured it , however it quickly dissipates to a film/lacing . when agitated the film/lacing becomes a little thicker , but it really does n't look like a healthy head . other than the issue of the head , this beer looks pretty good . only if it had better head retention ... the first aroma from this beer that i noticed was a hoppy smell . i do n't mean like ipa hoppy , but the hops in this beer definitely came through in the smell . i also smell a hint of spice ( s ) . i really do n't detect any malt in the aroma . this is definitely not how i expected this brew to smell . after drinking various other belgian pale ales i expected more of a malt character in the aroma and taste of the beer . the taste of this beer definitely surprised me when i first took a drink of it . i was expecting a taste similar to or along the same lines as grimbergen blonde or leffe blonde . i must say that i definitely enjoy this brew much much more . when it frist hits the palate the first thing i taste is the hop influence in this beer . its not , as i said before , hoppy like an ipa ; rather it is just hoppier than other belgian pale ales that i have consumed . after the hops are tasted on the back of the tongue i notice that i can taste the spices that i detected in the aroma of the beer . once swallowed the spice flavor grows while the once dominant , but not strong , hop character diminishes . the beer has a good mouthfeel . it is not over or under carbonated and the amount of carbonation compliments the medium-heavy body of this brew . it goes down really smooth , just slides right on down the throat . i would most definitely buy more of this beer . infact , i prefer it to other belgian pale ales that i have had . perhaps this is because this style may have been americanized by goose island . perhaps they have decided to forego the sweet taste of belgian pale ales brewed in europe and instead give it a good mix of a hoppy and spicy character . whatever the case is i can only say that i prefer this brew to other belgian pale ales i 've had ( how many times have i said that now ? it feels that 4-5 might be an accurate count . ) .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	ok so appearance is not good , looks flat and no real head or lacing . smell is also pretty bad , i 'm finding a bit of oaty mlat flavor , but thats about it . taste is a bit better , but not great still . the oaty flavor is present but i may detect a smidge of hops on the back end . mouthfeel is decent , lots of carbonation . drinkability is ok .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 1.00	from notes largely clear with a beautiful golden hue that lays a foundation that allows tawny-coppery influences to shine . there is plenty of animation noticed in the liquid . the head was white in color ; at the apex the foam was slightly over two fingers in height . head retention was fair ; it faded quickly to a thin , soapy cap . this small cap did last for a while . there was no subsequent lacing . the appearance is average , on the whole . sure the color is lovely but i want more to look at , if the head retention was better and there was some lace the appearance would be much improved . oh well . it gets better from here ! the nose is soft but ample in maltiness . there are kisses of toffee . i can easily notice whispers of herbal flowers . caramel biscuits . toasty . there are very weak , nondescript , fruity notes . the potency is moderate in potency but i really like what it says . ghost suggestion of spiciness . clean . this must be from munich , ct . the nose is dead-on for the style . it is perfectly articulate . i do wish the bouquet had more liveliness though . it is extremely inviting ! the palate is fantastic . addicting . liquid cocaine . this beer needs to come in liter ( s ) bottle because 22-ounces is not enough . i am drinking this faster than i can take write things down . i really dont even want to review this beer anymore ; it is so dam tasty . i mean screw it . really . shit . ill keep righting . the malt profile is perfect in this beer , it is sweet but wide and it encompasses soft caramel flavors and some toffee . there are hints of toasty biscuit with a whisper of honey . sugar cookie . toasted bread . clean at the finish yet the aftertaste has some spicy hoppy notes . damn this is good . it is simple but it is also everything i want with the style . lovely . the mouthfeel is relaxing , a touch fuller then medium in body . the carbonation is on the low side but it is very fitting . drinkability is perfect . i wish i had many more bottles . wow , this beer is great . id love to session with this beer . the complexity is low but the end result cant be ignored . thanks unionmade this beer was awesome .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.50 0.60	an absolutely beautiful pour generates a very active three finger head of dark brown chocolate colored head that quickly faeds and leaves no lace . the body to this beer is as black as indian ink and just as thick . nose has a feel of cola and fresh ground chicory coffee , very woodsy backround funk . as i take first sip the first thing that comes into my mind is wow this isnt quite right , an old soured coffee with an electric fuzzy hue that sticks on the back of the tongue . this quickly shines through as a bitter coffee feel . you really need to drink this beer close to room tempature . it lacks considerable balance that would make this brew a real winner that it should be . mouthfeel is a sour bitter hue that hangs on long . i 'm hoping that i just got a bad bottle because base on other reviews , it just didnt seem right .

0.60 1.00 1.00 0.90 0.90	aroma : a thick malty caramel smell . appearance : chestnut color , low head retention . taste : sweet malty flavor . caramel/molasses and raisin . mouthfeel : thick body , hot alcohol warmth . drinkability : a fantastic example of a dessert old ale . i wish i could get some more of this .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.40 0.40	super cloudy mahogany brown and red color . thin half finger of head . looks deep and thick ; milky . the barleywine aroma is topped with a grainy malt . the grains are almost palpable . totally overshadows everything and smells musty rather than rich . medicinal . the alcohol is huge in this sweet dark cherry and sour wine grape . heavy barley ; almost as if it was dry-barleyed ? very sour like an old wine that 's gone spoil 'd . feel is a thick grainy film . feels rough . thick and syrupy with grit , which might have been ok if the flavor were n't so brutal . this is a powerful , harsh brew . i think it overdoes it . not a fan .

0.80 0.20 0.40 0.20 0.20	i 'll admit i was disappointed when i learned the blackberry witbier had won over the coffee stout so i 'll admit i 'm a little biased in writing this review . however i decided to give the blackberry witbier another try and pick up a 6-pack . plus , the purple labels are pretty unique . appearance : cloudy , hazy gold , full white head . looks like a witbier . nice representation of the style . smell : an astringent berry smell . quite unpleasant . taste : medicinal , very much like cough syrup . although i 'm drinking it in january , this would n't be refreshing in the middle of summer . mouthfeel : medium body , difficult to keep in mouth very long due to the unpleasant taste . drinkability : poor . i had a difficult time finishing 12 oz and was angry at myself for buying a six-pack . overall : i 'm normally a huge fan of all things sam adams . although many do not like the cranberry lambic or cherry wheat , i feel that they are have their place depending on the time of year ( i really associate the cranberry lambic with the holidays ) . perhaps sam adams was trying to create another fruit-forward refreshing offering for the summer months , but this is by far their worst offering . it just tastes too much like berry-flavored cough syrup . you may want to try a bottle for the novelty , but i would n't recommend wasting your money on a 6-pack .

0.20 0.50 0.30 0.30 0.30	poured a very cloudy pale yellow green color with a yellow/green foamy head . smell is dominated by apple . the taste is just bad . i drank a couple of sips and poured the rest down the drain . granted , i 'm not a huge fan of fruit beers , but this was just nasty .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	batch no . 56 . pours with an outrageously massive head , a dense , simmering mass of eggshell brown rising over the rim of the goblet like a souffle . gooey , sloppy lacing dries out into strata of geologic proportions . average viscosity to this opaque , gleaming ebony liquid . what a visual feast ! pungent licorice and beechwood aromas along with heaps of near rauchbier-like smokiness are wrapped in a marshy nosefeel . the flavor , too , begins with a very strong , burning wood smokiness that develops into something more like heavy black pepper . whiffs of vanilla bean and juniper ( or thyme ? ) mingle with salt as the beer warms on the palate . by the end of the glass , it 's like drinking liquid kalamata olives , with a round , herbal bitterness , and tenacious smoky aftertaste ... almost `` gamey . '' saline mouthfeel has a body thick and syrupy enough to rival the most nefarious imperial stouts . a slow motion punch of alcoholic fire connects with the gut hard , but this is still very drinkable . seriously tranquilizing . this must be beer 's answer to opium or thai stick . amazing .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.40 0.50	500ml from the lcbo , love me a coffee stout . but not this one ... pours a nice dark brown with a creamy head that is almost greyish but has great staying power and leaves sticky lace . nose is cold coffee grinds with a hint of roast and some generic bland sweetness . not too sweet , lacks any real malt presence . light sourness , dry odd bitternes . this is a terrible beer , i do n't recommend . tastes like cold coffee that has sat in a grungy truck stop for too long .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	from notes ... pours a muddied amber color with a slight white head . aromas are pleasant and very honey dominant . not much else noticed , but this is still a nice beer to smell . taste is subtle . some creamy malts , somewhat sweet , with a definite honey taste . but like the smell , not much else going on with the flavors except the honey . mouthfeel is ok. kind of thin , but not bad . drinkability is ok as well . this is an average beer at best . it 's not bad , and it 's drinkable , but it 's very one dimensional , kind of boring and uninteresting .

0.80 0.50 0.30 0.30 0.30	bottle shared by starrdogg . served in a bruery tulip . pour yields a garnet-colored brew that is almost bordering on purple . good tan head and a bit of lacing as it goes down . nose spells trouble , as there 's quite a bit of an acetic presence right from the start . the nose also carries a bit of chocolate , raspberry , and cherry . those are nice notes , but they 're too far adrift in a see of acetone . the flavor is much , much worse , as vinegar is about all i 'm able to grab out of this one -- it 's simply too overpowering . yuck . really disappointing coming from ccb . feel is too vinegary and acetic . just ca n't get past it . do n't try this .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	poured into my stash ipa pint glass pours a crystal clea pale golden color , thin half finger head , not bad on the retention . thick strings of carbonation are apparent full of cooked grain and just cooked grain not much flavor , kinda like cooked rice , faint bitterness , almost zero sweetness watery , the forced carbonation combined with how dry it is reminds me of champagne but not quite in a good way ... overall , not terrible but not good , wish it had more flavor because it is quite refreshing and if it had the flavor to back it up it would be bad at all .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.60	chilled bomber into a glass . purchased at perry 's in livermore . a : poured an opaque mahogany color with ruby / orange highlights when held to a lamp . i dumped it into a 1l mug , and the off-white head was literally half the mug with even a careful pouring technique . took 10+ minutes to recede into a drinkable half-fingers ' worth of head , which remained steady throughout the drink . left substantial lacing down the glass . unbeatable appearance . s : bananas , cloves and other belgian spices upon the pop . the brew itself gave off more and more green apple ( acetaldehyde ) as it warmed , with raisins , brown sugar , and a little candy yeast rounding it out . noticeable fusel sting that really detracts from the aroma . t : an initially sweet taste of banana , raisin , and brown sugar . the mid-taste gave way to candy yeast and sour green apple , with the end taste largely a combination of cloves and spice . the finish was very sweet , and it lingered , but the aftertaste eventually become one of grassy hops and a little alcohol heat ( particularly fusel burn ) . m : medium-to-full-bodied , with medium carbonation despite the active head . does a lot for the style . the alcohol is not well-masked , and it stings the mouth and nose a bit . d : decent . i feel there are other belgian and belgian-style ales available in this flavor profile for a cheaper price and more regular attainability . i do n't doubt the quality of this beer but i do n't think it 's worth waiting a year for . also , despite proper hydration and eating with this beer , i had a headache the next morning -- and it was the only thing i drank . i blame the fusel , but who knows ...

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.80	poured into a weizenbock glass . pale ale color with a nice foamy , tight head ; just like a hefe . the aroma is a banana and clove exploison , mixed with band-aid . mild carbonation and a slight haze . hop particles are floating everywhere . this is an unfiltered beer to the core . the taste is a little mediciny at first . then the hop bite jumps in your mouth followed by the sweet banana and clove taste you expect in a hefe . i 'm not sure why this is classified as a weizenbock because i consider it either a maibock or hefe , imo . the body is perfect for a hefe . i would rate it better if it were classified differently .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 1.00	poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass . appearance : dark red , almost no carbonation and head . smell : i do n't smell raisin . i do get sour apple . taste : different than anything i 've tried . almost sweet , but not . i tend to stick towards hoppy beers , but this one has my attention . mouthfeel : beer hits the palate somewhat heavy , but finishes very smooth . drinkability : i was enjoying raison d'etre while i was brewing a batch of dfh 90 . it seemed appropriate . love it , and will definitely have it again . like i mentioned , a new style for me . but i dig this beer big time .

0.70 0.90 1.00 1.00 1.00	poured from the bottle into my kuhnhenn snifter . decided to treat myself tonight , and with adam ftw still in mind from the weekend , wanted to see what i thought of this one . a - pours a cloudy , murky , ugly brown . only the slightest lacing of white head around the edge of the glass , even with a vigorous pour . when held up to the light , shows a reddish hue around the edges that is quite redeeming for the hue of this one . looks thick and tasty , albeit an ugly shade of brown . s - bourbon vanilla , cherries , dark chocolate dominate the nose . really potent , which is much appreciated . smells somewhat hot , which is not at all surprising at 13.5 % , but it is a more integrated alcoholic aroma that is more of an accompanying piece than an unwanted intruder . as it sits and warms a bit , the vanilla and dark fruit begins to really dominate in the nose . simply awesome . t - oh wow , cherries , chocolate , and the backbone of bourbon vanilla that carries this one throughout . smoother than smooth , with absolutely zero alcohol sting . also picking up a bit of an oak taste from the barrel and more dark fruit in addition to the cherry . endlessly complex as each pour seems to open up different flavors that coat the tongue beautifully . as it warms more , some roasted malt profile becomes more prevalent as well . really a treat of a beer . m - perfectly silky and smooth with no burn whatsoever . coats the mouth beautifully and leaves a very nice film behind . for 13.5 % , the mouthfeel on this one is incredible . o - overall , the standard of old ales . i ca n't wait to get my hands on some more this year !

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.80	la trappe . poured a golden straw . minor head retained nicely , decent lacing . excellent aroma . lots of fruits both sweet and citrus , doughy yeast , something unknown but floral and distant anise perhaps . taste is the epitome of smooth . spices and yeast dominate . mildly sweet and fruity , fairly complex within a narrow range . zero bitterness in the finish , the hops are just for aroma . the finish is the sum of all flavors and evaporates rather quickly . mouthfeel is light and slightly prickly . the smoothness makes this stand apart from many strong pale ales . it is the perfect intro for those who do not like hops , those who shy away from bitter . cheers jd

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.40 1.00	this is my favorite budmillercoors product . however , it is not a sipping beer . it is a beer that i do n't mind drinking when someone offers it to me at their home . the beer is yellow and has not head . it is light in taste , with a light hop character that is detectable in the nose and the taste . it is light , refreshing , and drinkable .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.70	500 ml brown bottle , no freshness date . pours a hazy brown with an orange tinge . thick , frothy , off-white head of tiny bubbles . very thick layer of sediment in the bottle . spicy , yeasty aroma . very sweet with notes of ripe fruit - currants and raisins . caramel is present early on and phenols come through as the beer sits on the tongue , as well as faint alcohol , although it is quite well hidden considering the abv . spicy and bready flavours dominate , followed by a grainy finish , moderately dry . mouthfeel is thick and pleasant . carbonation is moderate . as i poured the second half of the beer into my glass , i got a lot of yeast , too much , and it was overpowering . a very careful pour is essential for this one .

0.30 0.50 0.30 0.20 0.20	not impressed with the pour , color or head . the color is a pale yellow rating a 4 on the srm chart . the head was little finger high for about 10 seconds , and i tried hard to get a good head . the first impression is a hint of lime over nothing else . there is little to no taste of anything i can decern , very bland . water has about the same feeling as this brew . i will avoid this beer unless it would hurt someones feelings if they offered me one . do n't spend your hard earned cash on this one unless you like very light lager .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.90 0.90	what a nice beer ; one of the prettiest i 've tried . in a tulip the beer was near black in color with a light brown head . the head lingered well , and left abundant lace . aroma a little timid . roasted malt , liocorice , and chocolate . the aroma came through much , much better in the taste . espresso , dark chocolate , and a hint of licorice . the flavors went well together , and produced a really smooth beer .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured into pint glass a : dark , opaque looking . very little tan head that quickly dissipated . i am new to drinking porters so i 'm not sure if a frothy head is to be expected . s : smells as i would suspect , chocolate and tones strong on the nose . t & m : taste definitely has some bitterness , strong chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste which i quite liked . has a toasty quality as well . i 'm impressed by this beer . i 'm pretty excited too because i used to hate porters but as my beer journey has progressed my tastes have definitely expanded . d : definitely drinkable , not too much on the coffee or chocolate notes in the taste . i can definitely see myself having this brew again .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.50	paid .75eur for a 500ml can . *reviewed on 06.07.2005 starts off with a golden clear base , medium white fluffy head , head retention for all 60 minutes and impressive lacing effects . smells like any typical american lager , but this is from belgium ? ! ? the taste is a one-dimensional lager . no destinct characteristics at all , but nothing bad about it . it 's pretty good in the mouth , never really any sense of harshness and the head made every taste a little cremey like , so it was good . this is n't by any means a session beer due to it 's lack of distinction . however i could drink them back to back if necessary . final thought : this is a major disspointment to come from the country known for it 's beer . luckily it was n't a typcial belgian ale but a cheap bud-like lager .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.60	a= after a somewhat vigorous pour i yield just a small wisp of a head that falls quickly to a layer on top followed by just a small ring around the glass . dark dark brown color venturing on black actually for some reason , it 's been a while since i had a coke but , it looks like a flat coca cola a little bit . s= malty and bready . it smells very doughy and a little toffee on it . t= sweet malt flavor . a small amount of yeasty doughy flavor comes through on the back of the tongue but it really is quite sugary on the tip . like a chocolate and caramel mix almost . m= finishes a little dry but still very good . not enough carbonation in my opinion d= pretty decent . i 've heard a lot of ppl say they like this over fat tire but i would disagree . fat tire i think tops this one . granted i have n't had too many belgian dark 's but i think this is a little quiet for a belgian .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.70	( 500 ml bottle ) . enormous thick and lasting beige head , colour is very dark brown , cloudy . aroma is immediately bread yeast , bread dough , fresh sweet buns . as the beer warms up , i also get rye bread , leather and caramel . flavour is rye bread , caramel ( too much ) , molasses , hints of roastiness and spices . warming mouthfeel . theres a very good beer hidden in here somewhere , but it remains unreleased . sweetness is mostly to blame .

0.60 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00	a : nothing exceptional about the over-all appearance . translucent , medium amber . s : overwhelming redolence of hops . intense and unforgettable , the scent is divine . t : a bold amalgamation of hops that harmonizes efficaciously . piney & orange peel oil : solid hop profile . ghost of malt . as one would expect -- hoppy after-taste . m : medium body and surprisingly smooth for a double ipa . slightly sticky . solid carbonation . o : one of the best double ipa i 've had the pleasure of enjoying .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.90	poured into my guinness 20 oz glass , no idea when this was bottled ... there is no date listed on the bottle a-pale orange color with a small inch head s- sweet pale malt , flowery and fruity ( citrus ) hops t- very flowery , earthy , oily hops with a subtle citrus fruit taste . being an 8 % alcohol beer there is a nice sweet pale malt backing that provides decent balance but the hops still shine through in the forefront like a good dipa should . great hop flavor . not much bitterness until the end ... just a lingering dry bitterness in the back of the mouth . alcohol is very well hidden . great flavor with not too much bitterness . i love this dipa ... i assume 102 ibus mostly come from the flavoring hops m- smooth creamy mouthfeel from the large amount of pale malt with a nice crisp finish d- very drinkable , could drink this all day ... i have to resist from pounding the whole thing in one sip

0.80 0.60 0.30 0.30 0.20	pours a very dark and hazy burnt orange color with golden yellowish orange hues when held to a light source and a frothy , pillowy two finger white foam head . excellent retention , only slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves chunks of soapy lacing behind . earthy aroma with a prominent honey presence as well as a very strong barrel character . lots of ashy charred wood with a heavy dose of boozy bourbon and some subtle vanilla . plenty of alcohol sweetness and earthy spice in the nose along with light fruit notes . smells slightly damp and funky and just a weird combination of scents . medium bodied with very tight carbonation up front that is immediately countered by a blast of bourbon and burnt wood that overpower almost everything and lingers throughout into a very hot , burning finish . the barrel character is way too strong in this beer creating an overly hot , boozy , astringent mess . lots of earthy oak and hot bourbon flavor with a decent bit of vanilla flavor that surprisingly does n't mellow things out much at all . underneath all of the heat there is a slightly creamy presence with hints of crisp light fruit and zesty , peppery spice . this beer is not very well balanced and is kind of an abrasive assault on the palate . it does n't taste very good and is tough to choke down . it improves a bit as it warms but it is still a one dimensional failure .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.30	vindicator ipa , served in the tap room at the brewery yellow gold with a lingering white head aroma is more floral than spicy but both are present . no citrus and no pine notes super malt forward . there is some hop bitterness but it 's not even at the levels of an english ipa . the claim of 79 ibu is laughable . i might be able to call this a standard ordinary bitter but as an ipa it is a failure . this beer is a lie .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	when poured from the 'banquet ' bottle , the foam was smooth and creamy . the color was a light watered down yellow with alot of carbonation . the smell was semi-skunky , with hints of wheat and hops . the taste was of a watered down version of your typical pils , but with no real taste . mouthfeel - light-bodied , crisp and very carbonated . drinkability - has a 'no taste ' value and the longer it takes to drink it , it tastes even worse .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	appearance - yellowish smell - smells like blueberries taste - sweet , too sweet for my tastes . leaves a definite blueberry taste in my mouth . almost has an alka seltzer effect . mouthfeel - high carbonation . overall - wo n't buy this beer . too sweet with strong fruity aftertaste .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	i sampled this at the brewpub . a : copper bronze , some off-white head , lots of lace . s : not a lot of nose , a little bland . t : bready , fruity , with a british bubblegum aftertaste ( from the yeast ) . very british . my taste score may be on the low side ( i 'm not a fan of the overtly british yeast ) . m : light body and carbonation . d : quite quaffable .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	poured from a 12oz bottle into a sam adams perfect pint . this one 's an old favourite , this was one of my first ipas , and i remember really enjoying it back in the day . time to see how it holds up . this one pours very clear and almost `` light '' looking for an ipa , it 's a rather light amber with a puny head . the aroma is fairly nice , albeit standard . citrus and floral hops over a caramel malt base . the taste ? yeah , this is still good . this is more of a balanced and refreshing ipa than a `` punch you with hops '' ipa . up-front caramel malts back away a bit to let some delicate floral hops and citrus aspects . very crisp and refreshing . the mouthfeel is nice , it 's a bit light for an ipa and well-carbonated , and the drinkability is very good , this drinks like a 5 % pale ale . an enjoyable brew , but nothing mindblowing . a good staple brew though .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.70	appearance - thick muddy brown with faint hints of red , light brown head thats somewhat rocky . smell - dark roasted malts with some brown sugar smells , and faint fruity aromas . taste - the malts take over here , caramel and chocolate notable . the lambic barely shows its head on the finish with a slight tart . a few spices mull around as well , namely cinnamon and ginger , as well as the alcohol showing its head on the finish . mouthfeel - medium body with a moderately light amount of carbonation for a belgian-style brew . drinkability - this wo n't be a staple as something does n't quite sit right , but its definitely tasty . bottle looks like a one and done though .

0.30 0.30 0.50 0.30 0.50	pours a weak golden color with minimal head . aroma is grainy and of stale bread . mouthfeel is the best part of this beer , but is far from impressive . i drank this by the gallon in college , but will now will only drink it again if nothing else is available at the time .

1.00 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.70	a : light orange color with the most insane head i 've ever seen . off white and very very creamy head . lasts a long time with lots of lacing . s : lots of yeast like smells : funky sourness and tart . nice sugary malts . tons of dried fruits : fig , plum , etc . banana is prominent and some spices : cloves , pepper , cinnamon . a bit faint though . t : starts up with nice sugary malts : tons of honey and brown sugar . some tart there too . then it 's all about fruits : bananas , dried fig , green apple , cranberries . some spices there too : cloves , cinnamon and a bit of pepper . very spiced/fruits bread kind of feel to the brew . ends up nice and dry with some piny hops . the alcohol is there and warms a bit when it goes down . complex , but it does n't blew me away too . m : very average . even there seems to be a ton of bubbles , it 's not that bad . i find the brew a bit watery for a 8 % brew , but it 's not that bad too . d : it 's high . i could drink another of this . it 's a very balanced brew , making it easy to drink . but since , it 's a style that is normally easy to drink , i wo n't score much higher than a 3,5 .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.60 0.50	draught at the brewpub . black with a small tan head . nutty , coffee , and cat piss aroma is a little strange . strong roasted coffee flavor with lots of roasted bitterness . finishes dry . watery and pretty dead palate . a step up from guinness in the dry stout area , but still not that great .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.60	i drank one beer as is and one with an orange wedge , the orange wedge improved the taste of the beer , but the review ( to be fair ) is of the beer alone like all my others . appearance - a bubbly , fizzy , and murky off-amber color that looks orange . on all of the pours only one had a head that was a thin collar that vanished shortly later . no lacing left at the end . this beer is highly carbonated but not as bad as some other macros or a soda . smell - big on wheat and orange . the orange is a rind and cider kind of smell with all the appropriate hints of spice . taste - similar to the smell . it leaves a metallic aftertaste that fades away to the usual macro lemon-rind . this beer is also surprisingly sweet , not in the good or fruity kind of way but like it was brewed with a lot of sugar . the orange rind made it more palatable but it also made it like an bitter orange soda . mouthfeel - fizzy and tangy similar to a flavored tonic water . light bodied and a smooth drink . sadly this is the beer 's best quality . drinkability - well , its smooth and light like i mentioned in the mouthfeel so it is n't hard to drink but why bother ? this is the kind of by the fire in the winter-time beer to warm you up but its not that enjoyable even in that setting . i felt gassy in-between sips .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 1.00	pours a light caramel , golden ( copper ) color , with almost no head . the beer is transparent , it almost looks like watered down cola . there is almost no head , and there is no lace left once the little bit of fizz bubbles off . the beer seems very light in the way of carbonation . there is certainly a citrus scent present , with some flora aromas as well . the beer smells sweet , but there seems to be a touch of pine or something similar present as well . the first taste you 'll notice is a bit bitter , but is followed quickly by a smooth sweet taste . the aftertaste though , is a bit rough . there is some wood/pine flavor that lingers in your mouth . minus the aftertaste ( while i 'll admit the wood/pine taste is acquired ) this is a good tasting beer . the sweet notes mix well with the hops , and the citrus a nice citrus tone . from `` blue moon '' , you may expect more of a `` orange '' flavor , but you 'll notice it is very subtle in this brew . the beer is smooth , it feels a bit more carbonated then it looks . mix the smoothness with the medium body , and you can certainly have more then one . they certainly do a great job at making this a sessionable brew . note : i bought the `` blue moon brewmaster '' pack . the pack included ; blue moon , pale moon , full moon .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.90	pours a clear yet deep amber with a fast two finger , receding head . very little bubbling and no lacing , but good color though . the aroma is a strong , sweet , toasted bread bomb of malt and just a bit of herbal hops . toasted dry malts give the taste givs freshly baked whole grain wheat bread and bg of rice scent . the hops add some grassy herbs and just a dash of citrus . palate is has an almost off-puting resiny palate for an octoberfest bier . great session beer wth a softly receding flavor .

0.30 0.30 0.40 0.20 0.30	i was n't paying attention to what i was doing and grabbed a case of these instead of regular high life 's ... boy was i sorry . not a great tasting beer at all . i hate to describe a beer as skunky or as piss but these fit the bill . i just could n't get over the first initial taste and things just got worse from there . i 'd avoid these like a screaming case of herpes .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	2002 bottling . -og : approx . 1115 -fg : approx.1.030 -abv : 11.4 % -aa : approx . 72 % -calories/12 oz : approx 379 -real extract : approx 11 p -floor-malted maris otter pale malt and fuggles hops imported from england -fuggles hops note -- i do n't have the exact original gravity for old stock ale ( though if someone gets it for me , i 'd be quite appreciative ) so most of the above numbers are approximations based on the fact that i know og is greater than 1.100 and my own rough estimation of apparent attenuation ( aa ) . old stock ale pours a deep , but brilliant garnet color : maybe chestnut or mahogany is more accurate ... a tan head is thrown up with the pour , but it slowly relents to the high abv and becomes nothing more than wisps of cirrus clouds across the top of the beer . interestingly , old stock ale smells almost completely inert . you 'd think that with that much gravity and the requisite hopping rate that i 'd be able to pick up something . however , i only get the vaguest dried-fruit maltiness and a bit of wine-like alcohol . the flavor is similar -- frightfully subdued . while there 's a lot of viscous mouthfeel , and quite a bit of carbonation , there is n't much flavor . i taste ( and feel ) a considerable amount of alcohol -- the mouthfeel is hot and peppery and the finish burns and tingles inside my mouth for quite a while after the beer 's been swallowed . if i thoroughly rinse my mouth with water , wait 5 minutes and then really concentrate , i can get a slight brown sugar flavor to come through before the alcohol takes over . where are the hops ? where 's all that malt ? for something with the shear quantity of raw ingredients as old stock ale , there should be a lot more going on in the glass . i 'm suspecting that there 's something wrong with my taste buds tonight , so i 'm going to re-visit this review after my next sample of old stock . however , i remember drinking last year 's vintage and having the same reaction -- understated . talk about subtle . subtlety is a great trait in most beer , but this is over the top subtlety . now that i 've let the beer warm to room temps , i can also pick up some raisin flavors , though the alcohol presence has increased . like i said , i 'll re-review soon to verify these results ...

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	i poured from a 40 oz . bottle into a small polar beer glass that i received from a friend in venezuela . a=a rather transparent light yellow . many noticeable , upwardly mobile bubbles . head was apparent and frothy for about 10 seconds and then disappeared quickly . s=faint but good ... a light smell of beer . t=i have n't had a busch in a long time -- and i liked busch when i drank it -- but this barely reminds me of that . a lighter taste , not really much different than other light beers , but still somewhat enjoyable . reminds me of an old milwaukee ( not the light version ) . m=okay , nothing outstanding , but not bad . d=definitely could get used to this ; the 40 oz . is priced the same as bud , bud light , and miller lite , so there is no price advantage to choosing this beer over others ; the taste is a bit better than lite . i bought this beer primarily to use as a `` ringer '' in helping me perfect a black and tan ... a pale comparison to the traditional lagers used , but it should help me eliminate some darker beers for black and tan use , i.e . if you ca n't make a black and tan with busch light , it wo n't be any use with better lagers .

0.50 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.80	selection in my beer of the month package . no freshness date , but not sure one is needed for this beer . 12 oz bottle poured into my st. bernardus glass apours cloudy rust color with absolutely no head whatsoever , no lacing either , is this beer flat ? we shall see . sfruity and sweet , spicy ginger , some ripe fruits , other holiday type spices show up , too , cinnamon , nutmeg , alcohol is hidden well ( it is 10 % abv after all ) tvery flavorful , all the smells come out in the taste , ginger is probably strongest , followed by ripe fruits , alcohol is hidden very welli expected it to be boozy , but its not . mvery , very smooth , medium bodied , good carbonation despite the appearance dvery good . i would love another , but could have two more . the 10 % abv is sneaky in this one .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.70	the mountains were blue , so i decided that this was ready to drink ( tee hee ) . liquid has a very clean body with barely any head to speak of and very heavy , almost unruly , carbonation . it almost resembles a watered down sparkling white wine . visually appealing when compared to miller lite ( which i had moments prior ) , but certainly not ideal for someone looking for complex characteristics . scent packs in very light malt , corn and butter . thankfully , its lacking the dreaded skunk aroma . smell is much stronger than a beer that is as clear as a glass of tap water deserves to be . flavor is watery up front with a slight malt and carbonation kick on the backend . butter is the most prevalent flavor note with the faintest malt buried beneath . it 's reminiscent of a filtered pilsener . this really is n't that bad and it may be a bit unfairly maligned . mouthfeel is paper thin , but a mild maltiness coaxes out some reaction from the tongue . i did n't really expect much from this one and have never been too impressed when i 've had it hundreds of times before . after close inspection , i 've come to the conclusion that this is one of the least offensive light lagers . it 's still only half beer , but it plays its cards right and can be consumed like cold water in the most desolate desert .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.60	50cl dark brown bottle , as shown . pours a nutty brown ( not a golden brown ! ) with a big , soapy light beige head with good retention and generous lacing . aroma is surprisingly yeasty , with a note of grapes - the overall effect is that of sour rye bread . more like the smell of pilsener , come to think of it . medium carbonation , light to medium-bodied - again , closer to a blonde than to a schwarzbier , even ! earthy , slightly watery mouth feel . taste is surprisingly light for a dark beer - if i closed my eyes , i would swear i was n't tasting a schwarzbier at all ! light roasted malts , some citrusy elements - an overall sourness , with a weakly bitter finish . hardly any after taste , except some metal maybe . those who are into stouts , or porters , or even schwarzbiers , will be gravely disappointed by this brew . a lagerish wimp that masks as a dunkel - if you compare it to kstritzer schwarzbier , or even krusovice , it comes across as half-baked and undernourished . not a good beer .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.60	grade for our group = c. '' nice summer beer - too girly for some '' look was described by our group as being everything from `` dehydrated piss '' to `` sexy orange with a hint of purple . reminds me of summer slam '88 colors . '' generally speaking the beer has a typical cloudy wheat beer look ... the head quickly vaporized . smell was described as having a hint of berry sort of like `` a cheap victoria 's secret perfume that leaves the sense of being in the basement of acasia house basement in fraternity row in shippensburg , pa '' to a faint sweet raspberry/grape candy smell . the `` feel '' was light in carbonation and almost champagne like in feel ... generally had the feel of a light , fruity beer . the drink was described as light and long with a sweet taste that stays in your mouth but no `` haze '' more like the reminder of something like perfume sprayed in the air . finally , the taste was described as wheaty and fruity in taste that fades to a tangy raspberry taste .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	after having this `` beer '' ( it will always be in quotes when referring to this b/c even though it 's categorized as beer it tastes like no beer i 've ever had ) there are a few things that amaze me . 1 . someone gave this beer a `` 5 '' rating . 2 . there are actually 2 people out there that want to trade for this beer 3 . there are other reviewers that had multiple bottles of this `` beer '' and promised to keep it on hand in their fridge . after having this `` beer '' i feel like i now have a category for where the absolute bottom is . i will never drink macro swill but at least it 's not as off or offensive as this `` beer '' is . i will acknowledge that i shared this experience with cmaruschak and mmmmbeeer but i 'm not sure i want to thank them for this experience . appearance : a fizzy yellow pour with a white head that does not retain in the slightest bit . i 'm pretty sure the water bloated pepper winked back at me . smell : yes ... it did smell . like wendy 's chili that had been sitting on a dashboard on a hot summer day for about 8 hours . taste : no ... it had none . i just taste heat ( if that 's even a taste ) . like licking salt or maybe some mexican back sweat . maybe like the time when i was 8 years old and we threw together mustard , dill relish , salt , cheap hot sauce and some other nasty spices in a bowl and dared each other to drink it . i ca n't take a sip of this without needed to drink or eat something else . mouthfeel : oily , light , leaves a lingering burning in the back of your throat like chloraseptic spray . drinkability : leave a burning in my stomach and makes my nose run . do not try this . this is the antithesis of beer .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.30 0.40	one of my favorite beers while in college . i did n't know about good beer back then . more importantly , i could n't afford it . so , busch was the cheapest and it was for me . other than getting you drunk , there are no redeeming qualities in this beer . the color is like something out of a urinal , the smell ... .is like something out of a urinal . the taste ? no , no , i wo n't go there , but i have tasted better in castor oil . there is nothing positive about the mouthfeel , so you swallow without letting it touch anything but your throat . truly , a beer the world can l live without .

0.80 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.50	this beer has a pinkish hue , a nice color and good head formation upon pouring into a pint glass . that 's pretty much where the fun ends though . the smell is a very slightly-sweet version of an american macro , like keystone light . when the beer first hit my tounge , i sensed the strawberry but it was n't overwhelming or overly sweet , which was good . there is hardly any feeling of this being a wheat beer though , without the yeasty , unfiltered flavor of other wheat beers i enjoy . the disappointment i experienced is probablly unique to me in that regard , but then strawberry is also an unusual fruit for brewing . the mouthfeel is watery and bland , and in fact upon swallowing the beer , i felt like i just swallowed a mouthful of water . all in all , i was unhappy with this beer given its potential as being something unique and different . i love wheat beer and i love strawberry 's . unfortunately , for me , this beer shows that two rights sometimes make a wrong .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.40	served in a nonic glass at the bar in the jurys inn , nottingham . appearance : clear coppery color with a rich thick white foam . plenty of persistent lacing on the glass as i drank it down , but the foam on top does eventually go to just a thin film . smell : practically nothing . a hint of faint malt , otherwise nothing . taste : a very weak british bitter taste , with some metallic notes . the malt is also weak against the bitterness - but not a lot here . mouthfeel : not a lot of carbonation ( but that 's okay for a british beer ) but a bit watery . nothing really strong going on here . drinkability : ummm ... .no , i ca n't have again . shame that a beer which looks so nice at first turns out to be a let down in all other categories . oh well .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50	a - straw yellow , clear with no head . s - some corn with a faint graininess , typical euro lager aroma . t - as with the nose , not a lot going on here , some corn and light sweet malt . no nasty metallic stuff . m - clean , crisp and light bodied . nice moderate carbonation . o - sessionable and clean , but definately nothing exciting about this .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 1.00	even smoother on tap , and if i may say , a really unique tap head at that . so very smooth , the orange zest and corriander blend with great balance . the aroma can not be denied- one smell will wet the tongue and leave no doubt as to what you are about to experience .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	a murky wheat amber colored body hosts a quick fading even tan head . nose is a nice mingleing of malts and hops with notes of crisp citrus , dark sweet fruit and even hints of port . a shocker to the mouth at first sip with piney sharp hop motes and a malty feel that is slightly sweet and almost taffy like . avery unique collaberation of flavors going on here that does reflect a german style well . the wheat is raw and alive as this beer really grows on you . sweet fuzzy hue on the mouthfeel that becomes richer with warmth . this beer is a pleasure to drink .

0.40 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.70	1996 vintage 275 ml bottle cracked in january 2011 , poured into an oversized snifter . the soft and slightly crumbly cork is a sure clue that some oxidation is to be expected . murky cola brown body with an exceedingly brief wisp of bubbles and a short-lived ring of bubbles providing the only signs of life . not too impressive looking , but things get better soon enough . no need to dig down into the snifter to search for the aromas ; they practically jump out of the glass . potent sherry and vinous notes with a dash of tart cherry , toffee and booze underneath . quite tart , almost to a distracting level , but there 's plenty to like here . warming booze and buttery toffee somewhat smooth out the tartness . lots of sherry and vinous flavors . a slippery and smooth body . very little carbonation , but you wo n't really miss it . pleasant notions of cherry pie , figs and chocolate make periodic appearances . overall impression : not a bad old ale here . i 'd like to try this one both younger and older for comparison

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.70	growler the bruery placentia , ca a clear light golden with a big and thick foaming white head . the head sticks around for quite a while and eventually leaves thick and sticky lacing all down the glass . does n't get better ! a bready , somewhat sweet , and very corny aroma . there 's a bit of tangy spice initially up front , but it 's dominated by bready malt and corn . a sweet , smooth , grainy , somewhat spicy , and corny saison . not as funky , bright or `` farmhouse '' as i really like , but a good , bready saison . a relatively light mouthfeel . incredibly drinkable . an interesting and bready saison . not one of my favorites within the style , though given the ingredients , it came out actually better than i expected .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.60	golden yellow color with a one inch head and small lace . the aroma of light citrus and a hint of malts with a simple wheat aroma . the taste starts off mildly bitter with some light citrus and malt hints . a touch of obvious wheat but it fails in the feel dept . by having a high carbonation with a watery finish . some grains in there too but the balance seemed off . notes : a bud would be better .

0.20 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	a : super light water color with some yellow thrown in . minimal white head . no lacing . s : pure corn . really bad . t : just about the most watery beer i have ever had . some corn sweetness . m : water . d : why would anyone want to drink this ? glad i got to split this jewel with a fellow ba .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.60	22 oz bomber . 2008 version pours a deep , rich-looking mahogany brown body . hazy . off-white , foamy head slowly fades with nice lacing . good looking smells up front of alcohol and hops . pine . little bit of malt in there as well . first thing that hits my palate is the alcohol , very aggressive . hint of caramel malt , splash of citrus , followed by the hops . spicy as well , probably due to the alcohol content . it 's certainly warming , and the alcohol is n't that overwhelming , but it 's definitely dominant on my palate right now . oddly enough , the mouthfeel is a little watery . just a little . it 's not undrinkable by any means , but it 's not one of the more drinkable strong ales out there . overall , i have to admit i was disappointed . aside from the appearance , which i felt was superb . stone has such a great line of brews and i feel that this is towards the bottom . it 's not bad , by any means at all ... it 's just ( in my experiences ) i feel the arrogant bastard is a better strong ale , as well as the past double bastards . however , it is an enjoyable brew and due to it 's alcohol content , it has a welcome warming during these cold nights .

0.90 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.50	purchased from strong bros . liquor store , fayetteville , tn . i really tried to love this beer . i know how highly-rated it is , and i gave it every chance i could . but i just could n't get that much out of it . the beer pours into a snifter with a brown body and a very thick mocha-colored head . looks fantastic and inviting . i take a whiff of the nose , and get ... not a whole lot . slight citrus notes , slight astringent quality . even as the beer warms , i get very little complexity or even aroma at all , but simply the same aroma further and further . the flavor is mainly citrus , mostly oranges , with a strong astringent hit to the palate on the finish . as the beer warms , the citrus gets a bit stronger , but so does this weird dry alcoholic character to the aftertaste . not terrible , but certainly not something i 'm itching to drink several bottles of . mouthfeel is thick and luxurious , foamy and pleasant , largely owing to the thick foamy head . the moderately decent flavor , combined with the high alcohol leads to a low drinkability for me . i may try this again in a year or two when my tastes may have changed , but for now there are better ways to spend the six bucks or so i spent on this 11.2 oz bottle . i ca n't believe this beer is as highly-rated as it is .

0.50 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.90	a- it seems that none of the beers that i have from short 's are going to have full heads , or even little heads for that matter , so it 's good for their sake that appearance counts for less of the new ratings . maybe they just ca n't present themselves nicely in a snifter like most other beers . i barely got any head at all , even from a rough pour after swishing the bottle around a bit . it soon receeded to less than a film , although there were little bits of brown coming up from the deep black body . there was also a slight amount of lacing . s- there 's a gigantic amount of oatmeal and molasses to the nose . large amounts of cocoa as well . it 's truly enticing . it 's like they took the aromas from several of my favorite stouts and mixed them . t- sweet from the oatmeal is balanced by the cocoa 's bitterness , with a ton of molasses as the foundation . it 's matching the description on the bottle pretty perfectly . while i know this stout ends up on the bitter side , it still feels pretty balanced . the cocoa adds up though , and adds a lot of sharpness . it takes up the greater part of the aftertaste as well . m- it feels pretty heavy , but is n't the fullest stout by any means . it has a nice creamy feel which i 'm coming to expect from most of short 's brewing beers . they really tend to do well at making a beer that feels nice . d- for a 10.8 % beer , it 's pretty damn drinkable . there 's only a little bit of heat as it goes down . no heat can really be tasted ; only felt . it 's a very nice interpretation of the style , albeit simple . cocoa , oatmeal , and molasses , and then some more cocoa sums it up . i 'm really enjoying it , but ca n't say much for it 's complexity . but for what it 's worth , they did what they were trying to quite well . it 's a beer that i find myself appreciating more a when i do n't analyze it . a great value as well .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.70	the color is a nice clear , bright amber . the nitro can pours a thick , foamy head that rests nicely on top of the glass and leaves patchy lacing . an uncomplicated blend of mild bitter hops and light malt . the taste is light herbal citrus hops with a light bitterness and grains . malt is somewhat shy but does make an appearance . there 's a slight metallic / astringent tint to this as well . these end up marring an otherwise pleasant finish . mouthfeel is a little thin and light-bodied , though very smooth and creamy due to the nitro can effect . this is n't one to avoid , but i 'm not sure i 'd like it without the added benefits to the appearance and the mouthfeel that the nitro can provides .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.60 0.60	poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass . a : pours a clear orange with a one finger white head . s : light citrusy hops but not much else . t : fairly bready , malty , and sweet ; some citrus hops show up on the finish , but they are very muted . m : light bodied , well carbonated , and smooth finish . o : a good attempt at an introductory pale ale ( i 've tried and prefer their 'elevated series ' copper cone pale ale ) at an accessible price for someone new to the craft beer scene . definitely worth drinking for something on the lighter side , but the hops definitely are too light to form any sense of balance .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	picked this up at the brewery on my recent trip so you know it 's fresh ! appearance - murky brownish red , leaning towards the dark brown side more though . long lasting lacing , as well as a one finger head that remains constant . smell - grapefruit - taste - grapefruit continues into the flavor , but is hit hard with a load of caramel malt sweetness that balances it out nicely . it finishes with a strong bitterness that lingers . grapefruit and pine is prominent on the finish . alcohol definitely warms you after the sip . mouthfeel - medium to high carbonation with a thick mouthfeel . overall - i guess i really do n't know this style very well . i think that it makes sense to have a nice malt backbone to a double red . this is a substantial beer and one that although i could n't drink a ton of , i 'd definitely visit it again next time i 'm in san diego . reminds me a bit of a larger version of surly furious .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured into a snifter . bottle # 66 of 225 . 2011 vintage . this was my favorite beer on-tap at the release , but my palate was less than fresh by the time i got to this . 3.0 a : black color . an aggressive pour yielded barely one finger of light brown head that fell pretty quickly , but did leave a bit of lacing behind . 5.0 s : this smells amazing ! really absolutely wonderful . what a difference a clean palate makes ! the vanilla and rum are both present in ample amounts and work extremely well together . lots of chocolate , a moderate roastiness , some oak and caramel , and overall sweet but far from cloying . not a hint of alcohol . 4.0 t : the taste is several steps below the nose and the nose is n't really indicative of how this tastes . the aroma suggests a sweet , rich chocolately stout , but in reality , it 's much drier than can be expected . there 's a healthy moderate bitterness in here . whether it comes from the dark malts alone or if there is some hop contribution is not apparent . the vanilla and rum are much less apparent than in the nose , but are still a feature . moderate roastiness with much less chocolate , caramel , and overall sweetness than the nose . again , alcohol is well hidden . it 's still a tasty beer , just not an outstanding one . 3.5 m : the mouthfeel leaves much to be desired . while i wanted a thick , rich body , this only offers a medium one . the carbonation is on the lower end of acceptable . super smooth , but could be creamier and a thicker body would certainly help with that . 4.0 d : i had a great time smelling this beer , a pretty good time tasting it , and a mediocre time sloshing it around in my mouth so i guess the experience is overall positive . i 've never had the original dark apparition , but the bourbon barrel variety was much thicker and richer than this one . i 'm not sure what happened in that rum barrel , but hopefully the next time this is released , the body is richer and the taste is deeper .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.90 1.00	on draft at mudville in lower manhattan . this is a favorite of mine that i 've enjoyed bottled many times , first experience with it on draft though . a : pours a very dark and ominous jet-black coffee color with a finger of brownish head . good lacing , poor head retention . s : sports a rich bouquet of coffee & bittersweet chocolate flavors that grab your attention immediately . decadent ! if they made mokah air fresheners , i 'd be all over them . t : starts malty with coffee and chocolate right behind . the bittersweet chocolate lingers and fades into a surprisingly dry , hoppy finish . this is n't a super complex beer , but it excels superbly at its goal of melding mocha into an imperial stout . m : my pour was served too cold ( typical ) , so it certainly improved as it warmed , but the creamy mouthfeel i was hoping for from the tap never materialized . at temperature , it 's a full-bodied brew with the right amount of carbonation . i 'd loooove to see this on nitro tap ! d : ridiculously smooth and easy to drink . among the most well-made beers i 've ever had . cheers !

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.80	on tap @ the brewery 03-26-09 pours a light hazy yellow , my friend ordered hefeweizen and i actually thought it was the dipa based on appearance . the smell was a grapefruit , citrus bomb . this was a really well done dipa , with a great hop attack and balance of malt and hops . goes down pretty smooth w/o noticing the 8 % alcohol . i 've found that most brewpubs miss the mark when making a dipa , but harvest moon really has a winner here . highly recommended

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	bottle , best before date 03.01.11 , so do not take this review to heart unless you 're sitting on a past date bottle you 're about to crack open . a - black/brown - garnet around the edges of the glass . the head fades to a little bit of foam after only a few minutes . s - nothing . t - slightly sweet malt , some fruity esters , soy sauce , and a litte , metallic twang ( perhaps from age ? ) . there is a bit more roast character evident than i expected for an imported baltic porter . absolutely no hop bitterness . m - somewhat thin , becomes slightly thicker with warmth . good carbonation . o - i would certainly drink this again , but not seek it out specifically ( perhaps a bottle within it 'best before ' range ) . i 'm looking for syrupy with minimal carbonation , and enough malt and sweet to balance that roast .

0.60 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.70	opened a two year old aged 22oz bomber into a guiness curved pint glass . appearance : rich amber red hue . no head whatsoever . poured very smoothly out of the bottle with good amount of sediment . smell : very sweet aromas . it was similar to raisins or figs with other candied fruits apparent . very slight scent of alcohol . taste : subtle and appealing . not very powerful but presenting fruit flavors going down . solid after taste . almost a caramel flavor along with the candied fruit . not overly alcoholic . mouthfeel : amazingly creamy . this aged bottle really mellowed out and improved this beer . it was infinitely smooth . drinkability : this bottle was very drinkable . it was impressively smooth and had ood , sweet flavor without tasting too alcoholic . i would drink it again , if it were aged . all in all it 's not bad , it was a good aged barleywine and i 'd recommend it .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	a : pours a light orange-amber body . regardless of the angle of the pour there is little head ; what is there dissipates pretty quickly . s : smells of sweet biscuity malts and honey . reminds me of a less round and creamy fat tire , and with less wheat in the nose . t : the honey comes through pretty strongly but pleasantly . not too much else though -- some malts that taste a bit burnt at the end . m : alright at cellar temp ; a little low on the carbonation and might prefer it a bit colder . d : probably one of my favorite epas ; sessionable , simple , and enjoyable .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	on-tap at beachwood bbq , a : pours a light to medium orange , with a soft soapy white head . full concentric rings of lace and very good retention are a highlight . s : some tropical fruit , papaya , grassy , but not too expressive . t : green and damp with a earthy to grassy hop profile . some light nuance , but the hops are n't wowing . a nice drinkable flavour though , nothing offensive . m : medium-bodied , frothy , soft carbonation . d : compared to the brilliant apex and the very good racer x , this dipa from bear republic is left in the dust . a good beer in its own right , but coming from br i expected better .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	nola brown ale , draft a big thick rocky head , deep ruby red color when held to the light . a nice looking beer . s a slight hop aroma , but you really have to try . i do n't really smell anything else in this beer . with the big head , i expected lots of aromatics , but was disappointed . t a little malty sweetness at first , then fades to a salty taste . i know that does n't seem right , but that 's what i taste . very little hop flavor . no one flavor stands out , it lacks the deep malty complexity that i expect in a brown ale . no off flavors , so there 's nothing wrong with the brewing practices , it just lacks character . m thin not much body , lacks a co2 bite even though it had a very nice head . o i'ts an ok beer . to be honest i do n't really do n't see the appeal of this particular beer . i do n't think i 'll be having another .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.80	light golden color ; a little lighter than expected . medium white head . smells hoppy ( citric , very grapefruit-like ) with an underlying sweetness . taste has a prominent sweet malt base , almost sugary . hops are very flavorful ( citric ) and also bring a decent bitterness , but are never harsh at any point . you can tell several varieties are used quite successfully . moderate bitterness lingers in the finish . mouthfeel is smooth , full , and creamy . high abv is well-blended/barely noticed . very tasty and drinkable beer that packs a punch . nice .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.60	12 oz . bottle poured into a tulip glass . appearance-medium to deep gold , quite clear , moderate off-white head with moderate retention . aroma-resin and pinesol , with a hint of lemon . so hoppy its almost chemical , like dry erase markers or white out ( could be a phenolic note or something , it 's very unusual ) . i ca n't decide whether or not i like it . woody , fresh oak aroma ( dissimilar from a barrel aged aroma ) . woody alcohols as well . malt is almost entirely imperceptible underneath the hop onslaught . flavor-flavor is much more manageable . sweet , honey and bready malt creates a foundation for citrusy ( lemon and orange ) , piney hops . oak character does n't make much of an appearance in the flavor , maybe as a slight young wood note in the finish , but i do n't think i would have perceived it as such if i had n't been looking for it . finishes semi-sweet , with moderate hop bitterness , much less than i was expecting after the searing aroma . mouthfeel-medium body , with medium high , prickly carbonation . slight alcohol warmth . no astringency from hops . finish is a little bit sweet , though not quite cloying . i was expecting more , but this beer was just okay . the strange chemical hop aromas were a big turn-off for me . the flavor was pretty damn good except that the finish was a hair too sweet , which did n't leave me thirsting for more .

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.70	a : dirty straw , pours with a white head , absolutely no retention or lacing . s : big clove aroma , with some nice banana bread . t : pleasant banana & clove spicing , bready maltyness , pineapple & hints of vanilla . it tastes surprisingly good ... and is well above most new-world hefes . m : moderate body is well carbonated . d : a decent drinker .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 1.00	aroma- oak , sour , dark berry fruit , cranberry and black currant , a very svory aroma , floral , lightly horsey , appearance- brilliant clarity , ruby red , thick , moussy off-white head , flavor- crystal malty sweetness with light notes of dried cranberry , whisky , grape , ginger , apricot , plum hey dries out finish , mf- really a pretty crisp sensation , medium bodied , very grippy ,

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.30 0.20	this is a bitter ipa , even for ipas . this is coming from an ipa lover . in terms of style , it is n't a west coast ( usa ) ipa by any stretch of the imagination . the citrusy , dry-hopped aromas are completely missing . it is n't an east coast ( usa ) ipa , being even too bitter for that and lacking big malt characteristics . it certainly is n't an english ipa either , being so bold and lacking the smooth mouth feel . it has good color , but beyond that that this ipa is not a pleasant one to drink . its overpowering , imbalanced bitterness leaves the drinker with little else to come away with . i should add that this review is for the non-cask-conditioned version . the other is such a different beer it should have its own review page .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60	now watching : dvr of ted kennedy 's speach at the dnc thanks to hb liquor warehouse for this bottle . a- clear , dark amber color with a two inch head with an average pour into a 20oz glass . head almost immediately turned from smooth to rather lumpy and then down to a level disc . s- more malt than hops and something odd , almost like wet leather . t- does not taste like an almost 9 % beer . also does n't really taste like an imperial ipa or even an ipa . more like a roasty , orangey pale ale . m- hops come through more in the mouthfeel than anywhere else , as it bites slightly on the sides of the tongue and the back of the throat . solid carbonation . d- drinks like a friend 's decent home brew .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.70	pours a hazy amber colour with one of the most impressive head i have ever seen . a frothy rocky mountain large off white head . retention is phenominal as it heavily laces the sides of the glass . aroma of grapefruit hops , pine , metallic , soap and some malts . initial taste of syrupy sweet malts balanced by bitter hops . finishing with bitter hops and mild caramel malts . medium body , palate duration is good . very drinkable and most definitely presentable .

0.40 0.30 0.80 0.70 0.80	found this single 7oz green bottle at binny 's in glen ellyn , il for $ 1.09 . no back label with information about the beer and no freshness date . at just 7oz , this beer will only fill up your glass about 2/3 full , so feel free to give it a hard pour right down the middle . even with a hard pour this pale yellow beer only made a finger white head that disappeared in about 30 seconds . surprisinglt it did leave a few spots of lacing on the glass . this beer was skunked beyond belief and i was n't sure i would even be ale to drink it , but after i let it sit and breath a bit , most of the skunkiness wore off and i was able to pick out a sweet grainy corn smell . the taste was pleasantly sweet with both malt and corn flavors , but it also had a small hop presence for balance . the mouthfeel lived up to its namesake as a cream ale . it was n't a heavy beer but it certainly was smooth and creamy with a medium high carbonation level . i would like to try another one of these and see if i get the same skunky smell , because without that i could see drinking a bunch of these . it 's a good little beer .

0.70 1.00 1.00 0.80 0.90	looks like mud with a little bit of foam on it . smell is excellent . dark fruit , berries , and sweet nutty aromas . a touch of spice , too . flavor was almost overwhelmed by berries . smooth chocolate and vanilla , more dark fruits , and burnt toast finishes things off . the toasted wheat flavors really balance things out , otherwise it would be too sweet . the flavors are all good , but that balancing act is what makes it great . perfect creamy mouthfeel . not too heavy , not too thin . alcohol content is hardly noticeable at all .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	had this beer on tap at the stirling hotel in stirling , nj . ( a great place ) poured a wonderfully rich yellow color . it was cloudy with a half inch of creamy white head . nice lacing with this beer . smelled of rich hops . nice citrus undertones . reminds me of orange rine . soft hops are present from the front to back palate . if i had to guess i would say that if was a wet hopped beer . very long finish with hints of grapefruit and lemon . moderate carbonation with a really nice , creamy mouthfeel . the creaminess reminds me of dog fish head 120 minute ... at a fraction of the price . i love this beer , but i prefer the german version .

0.90 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	bottle courtesy of plucier : poured extremely cloudy whitish/yellow color ale with a nice small pure white foamy head with good retention . aroma of medium wheat with some very subtle spice note . taste is lighter then expected with some wheat but no bubblegum notes that i usually appreciated in an hefeweizen and some very subtle spices and therefore no coriander that i usually like in my witbier . it appears that by mixing those two i am not getting the best of both word . this is probably one of the weakest offering from this fine brewer .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	500 ml swingtop bottle is a striking , cobalt blue . the most beautiful bottle i 've ever gazed upon . many thanks to brewfan for the trade . pours dark brown and almost opaque , ruby mahogany when held to light . a few large beige bubbles comprise what might be called a head , but a persistent collar decorates the chalice . aroma has a pervasive maltiness , with boiled toffee and molasses . plums and bing cherries add an alluring fruitiness . notes of good cognac add a syrupy vinous note . mouthfeel is almost full bodied . subdued carbonation fits the style well . taste is excellent , with fruity notes of cherry and plum , accented by toffee and vinous cognac . warming alcohol adds some peppery spiciness . brown sugar notes join in at the finish , adding to the english barleywine character . very tasty . this is one of the best barleywines i 've sampled . the cobalt blue bottle certainly makes for an extraordinary presentation . in my opinion , this is much more an english style barleywine , and definitely one of the better ones to be found .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	pours black with a very thin white head , and a little lacing . smell is of coffee , some chocolate , some vanilla , and a touch of licorice . taste is thick and dry , coffee , bakers and milk chocolate , vanilla , and licorice , ends dry and a little bitter .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.80	poured into a tulip glass , bell 's java stout is pitch black with a huge , fluffy , off-white head . sticky webbed lacing works its way all around the glass . looks great . upon cracking the beer there was a nice whiff of dark roasted coffee rising up from the bottle . swirling the glass reveals a strong aroma of coffee grounds . almost seems like i 'm scooping out grounds to dump in the coffee filter . a little bit of roasted malt comes through as well , but coffee grounds are the dominate flavor . lots of coffee in this beer . tastes like someone dropped a strong cup of joe in my stout . there were some metallic notes in the aroma , but they are mostly gone from the flavor , which is nice to see . bits of chocolate and toasted malt hold up the coffee flavor . bitter at times with some acidity , but this is a coffee stout . dry on the finish . mouthfeel is good . the body is somewhere between a regular stout and an imperial , which is to say that i think it is right on for this beer . carbonation is crisp and tingly . i would n't mind if it was toned down a bit , but overall its not bad . somewhat creamy . drinkability is good , especially for an imperial coffee stout . its great that bell 's bottles this in a regular 12oz bottle , which is the perfect size . i would say that this is a sipper , but a pretty quick sipper . overall , i was really impressed with this beer . bell 's makes some fantastic brews and this is another one of them . lots of stiff , dark , coffee in a well brewed stout . the beer looks beautiful and has a good coffee aroma . this is an excellent pairing of beer and coffee . i wish i had more of this .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.20	pours a orange-squashy color , and the carbonation seems to stick to the sides of the glass . weird . the head is a one-finger melange of swirly waves of foam.. airy and eggy like merengue . looks decent , a pale ale should have just this much color and apparent fizz . aroma is way off . this smells like sunny delight . this smells like orange hi-c. it 's sickly sweet with only the tracest amounts of earthy hop tones . something in the nose also brings to mind nut husks.. an overly bitter element balanced with metallic sharpness . weird , and not at all appetizing . ok , it 's a little more hoppy to taste , still , this beer falls flat . it 's loaded with buttery diacetyl , which completely kills the medium hopping that this beer has received . the finish is physically bitter , but even that pussies out before the creamy butter and rotten vegetable flavors subside . this beer is barely drinkable . that orange element is here , enjoyable to anyone who would prefer eating non-sweetened tang powder . really not a beer to savour by any means . i could go on about the other elements of this beer , but i feel confident just stopping now.. pouring the remainder down the sink-hole . drink at your own risk .

0.80 0.30 0.70 0.30 0.20	poured from 22oz bomber into a pint glass . appearance : rich , hazy medium orange hue with lots of apparent effervescence . head poured three thick fingers of pillowy ivory foam . pretty good in my book . smell : sweet malt aroma with a nicely complex hop profile . i get floral notes , some funk , and a strong , bitey citrus and pine aroma that is almost over the top . it 's a bit extreme , but i can appreciate its merits . actually , as i slowly drink through this beer , the aroma is really starting to grate on me in a bad way . not good . taste : whoa . the floral notes and strong , bitey , piney citrus that were so nice in the aroma turn into a tart , haranguing sour citrus flavor with some soapy notes . man , i was going to say `` it 's not that bad '' , but after a few more sips i do n't think i can . i feel like the brewer was trying to go into a new and exciting direction but ended up pointed the wrong way . this is just a craft beer gone pretty badly wrong . mouthfeel : medium , medium-light body with an ok level of carbonation . feel is good , despite the crazy flavor . drinkability : this flavor is just an absolute mess . hoppy , certainly , but it 's much crazier than any other ipa i 've ever had . bizarre flavors and extreme imbalance make this beer less-than-drinkable . not bad enough for a drainpour , but uff da . get it together , hood canal ! the more of this i drink , the nastier it gets . i 'm not certain i 've ever poured most of a bomber down the drain , but i think dabob bay ipa will get this distinction . just plain too nasty to finish . sorry , guys .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.60	pours a dark brown color with a medium sized creamy tan head that retains nicely for a while before slowly fading to a light ring and leaving a moderate amount of sticky lacing . smells very lightly of roasted malt . not much else is really there . nothing off about it but nothing to get excited about either . taste is a lot more pronounced than the aroma . notes of roasted malt and caramel are evident along with light touches of butterscotch and even a little smoke in the background . mouthfeel is smooth with a very dry finish . overall this was pretty decent but it just is n't exciting enough for me to want to drink it on a regular basis . i doubt i 'll be going back to this again , but i certainly do n't regret trying it one time either .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	awesome , awesome beer . i really enjoyed drinking this beer . i did my research before i started , but the smothness still suprised me . this beer is making me a big fan of sam adams . the lack of alcohol is a little worrisome , especially when you can only find this beer in sampler and holiday packs ( that i know of ) , but some of the great things are limited . i really enjoyed the look and eroma , very subtle nutlike smell . bottom line : smooth , good tasting beer . could be a little stronger with taste and alcolhol , but still really good . seriously , i 'm just getting nit picky , this is a good beer . well worth a try .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	sharp , slightly tannic porter that pours a deep dark ruby-brown with minimal head . you definitely need to let this one warm awhile until it settles down a little . glad i tried it but i wo n't go out of my way to get it again .

0.50 0.80 0.90 0.90 1.00	had this a kinfolks in maintou springs . i reckon this is a double stout , this reputed to around 14 % abv , aged in jack daniels barrels pours pitch black with minmal head , no lacing or head retention s : oaky notes , caramel , chocolate & rum t : rich malty/rummy caramel taste with hints of charred oak & chocolate . finishes , dry , sweet , slightly lactic & warming mf : thick & rich with minimal carbonation drank too easy for the heft . this is a very nice oaked/whisky/bourbon stout . got me in the mood to finish off my holiday shopping . talk about a winter warmer !

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	purchased as part of `` build-your-own-six-pack '' at local grocer . poured a small , quickly dissipating head on a golden body . smell and tastes were primarily the same : citrus , floral , possibly honey , with a dose of stale/dustiness . reminded me very much of some of the sorghum brews i 've tried . much fizzier than it looks . i would have rated it higher if it actually was a sorghum brew , but because it is n't , i was n't impressed .

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.30	live review . this was a big `` meh '' the first time i tasted it with some friends during our new years party . my buddy mooky left some beer from wy/co behind and this was one of them . thanks bud ! the bottle mentions the beer is named after a poached elk named samson and that the proceeds are going to help prevent poaching . i wish them well with their efforts . the beer pours essentially flat . a few big soap bubbles pop up here and there , but it did n't matter how rough i poured it , nothing was going to happen . the only saving grace is the thick black color , which i deem appropriate for the style . smell is pretty weak . some dark roasted coffee and bitter malts with lingering molasses . flavor is very bitter from lots of black malt . bitter black coffee and mild brown sugar . really not that much going on . mouthfeel is dry , bitter , and flat . slightly watery despite the thick appearance . drinkability ? man i am sitting here with my head resting on my hand , slightly cocked to the side in deep and uncomfortable thought . i stare at my nearly full pint and debate if it 's worth the effort to finish this thing ... probably not .

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.80	overall it was a good creamy beer . obviously had the tight nitrogen head . very drinkable and nice finish however lacks some taste before swallowing . appearance was dark reddish . a good beer to have while in ireland and different than anything i have ever tried before .

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.70	a- cloudy dark orange color with a small white head that dissipates into nothing . a- very fruity perfume like aroma . t- wheaty , it tastes very similar to eating shredded wheat in the morning . there is also a distinctive orange fruitiness about this brew . very light yeastiness . there is a very tart finish . m- smooth medium body with a nice crisp carbonation . d- i 'll admit , i expected a belgian style wit . this has to be one of the more interesting american wheats i 've had . the tartness is very odd and seems out of style . if you are looking for a refreshing wheat , look elsewhere . this is n't bad , but definitely not on par with other arcadia brews . that said i enjoyed some aspects of the flavor and the aroma .

0.80 0.30 0.80 0.20 0.40	i do n't know what the heck happened to this beer , but it was n't for the better . bottle was notched for the second week of june , but it was a newcomer to my local co-op 's shelf within the last month . i have to presume it was june of 2008 . it starts out fine ... a - pours very dark brown to black with a thick , light tan head . dissipates to a thick cap with fairly nice lacing . this is where this brew goes south very quickly . s - ridiculous amounts of grapey , vinegary sourness overwhelm a faint espresso note . t - more sour , grapey vinegar . if not for the appearance , i 'd swear i was drinking red wine and not beer . m - carbonation is moderate to pronounced . the `` beer '' is medium-bodied and the carbonation results in a very foamy , creamy texture . d - it 's hardly a beer at all , let alone a stout , but finding red wine to be a decent beverage from time to time , i can probably stomach these . i paid for them , so i 'll try to finish them . but jeez , this brew was bad , and not even close to what i was expecting from a coffee stout . clearly something went wrong in bottling and/or distribution , unless this is what the brewer really intended to produce . i 'm doubting that this particular bottle is actually ~6 % abv too , as there is a warming effect starting to envelop the back of my throat . i 'm also noting a wine-like alcoholic astringency as it goes down . i wish i had some way of measuring the abv of this one . note also , this was bottle one from a six-pack . hopefully they are n't all like this , though i have my doubts if they came from the same batch .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.70	a : pours a hazy dark copper/amber with orange hues . beautiful off-white head that clings moderately to the glass . s : nice sweet floral clove aroma . some citrus and spice . no typical piney hop aroma , but still quite good . hints of grapefruit , orange and pineapple , but very subtle . mostly floral . t & m : mostly a strong malty sweet taste with mild flavors of over-ripe pineapple and smoky tar or nicotine . very bready with a deadness not characteristic of the fresh tap or growler taste ! here is a perfect example of 'fresher is better ' ! i ca n't believe the difference with the bottle and keg . great beer , but try it fresh whenever you can .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.80	opaque . black hole is the visual m.o . here . the head is mammoth and very interesting . dark mocha color around the bottom near the liquid and a lighter tan color up top . the retention is amazing and there 's even some cragginess on the way down . very cool . the nose , even through the cap , is evident and big . two tons of roasted malt . mainly bitter chocolate and coffee , with some caramel malt sweetness . huge and complex . this one is right on the money . tons of dark chocolate and molasses , coffee and chicory , steel cut oats , anise , vanilla bean . mouthfeel is super smooth , evened out a bit by a high level of hopping . the abv is nice and low , not anywhere near a session beer but absolutely beautiful and a joy to drink .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	2nd bottle , so i know it just was n't that the first one was off ... . pours a cola brown , adequate carbonation . looks sort of thin . smells are dr. pepper with some cheap bourbon ( or southern comfort ) thrown in . some esters come through ( did n't like those in abacus either ) . no richness or deep dark smells . tastes are , not surprisingly , dr. pepper with some cheap brown spirits thrown in . a warm mixed drink that you tried a few hours later after the party , just for shits and giggles . simple brown sugar sweetness with some poorly matched alcohol is not what i was expecting here . thinner than it should be , but it matches the thin flavors , so at least it 's consistent . poured it out . this beer is a failure . i did n't have abacus fresh , but whatever went wrong with that beer over time went wrong here in spades . i guess i 'm not a firestone walker barrel guy , so more for all you .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.80	the looks are very pale and filmy . i can smell an interesting fruity smell that seems to have a combination of smells fighting to drown the other smell out . the taste is clean . i would not say weak , but there is that fighting for the dominate taste of the ingredients that ends up neutralizing each other . it goes down with a weak , but noticeable aftertaste . verdict : i would try another belgium beer unless you have tried `` many '' ( not just a few or none ) belgium beers then i would try it .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.60	poured into a pint glass from the nitro can . a : significant cream-colored head . beer itself is chocolate milk-colored . the cascading waterfall effect is very cool . s : smell is average at best . some burnt coffee bean is all i 'm getting . t : a little bitter and watery . taste certainly does n't match the appearance . m : solid . a bit thinner than i would have liked , though . d : very drinkable , as far as stouts go , owing to it 's slightly watered-down profile . guinness gets a bad rap from all the beer snobs on here , but for a macro , it 's decent .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	i really love this beer . i was very very happy to be in portland this weekend . color : amber looking almost dark but it is dark in this room . smell : a very nice hop to malty smell taste and mouthfeel : a very nice balance beer that wiill get in me in trouble tonight . nice hop finish .

1.00 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	poured into an a-b flute on 1/3/12 deep , slightly cloudy honey-amber color with a two and a half finger head that is intent on having the appearance steal the show . the head is very slow to thin and leaves thick lace along the way . retention is thin by the end , but it does last the whole way and lace remains excellent . i got ta give the appearance everything on this one . the aroma is something of a standoff between malts and hops , coming across with notes of peach cobbler , dusty bread , caramel , dry pine resin , orange peel and floral and honey sweetness . a similar dry pine bitterness ( and goodness this beer is dry ) offers a moderate bitter kick with accents of zesty citrus . the malt backing is sturdy but not nearly as strong as the aroma ; caramel and dusty biscuit . again , very dry . the feel is rather thin with carbonation on the higher side of average . the bitterness seems to jostle the feel too much . overall impression - this is decent , but as times i find it disjointed with too harsh of bitterness for the scope of the beer . i could go for more hop flavor and less outright bitterness .

1.00 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.70	a great show , and a great name for a not so great beer . pours from the bottle to a reddish orange with medium off-white head that lingers , and excellent lacing . from there , i must say nee ! aroma is faint grassy , floral hops . taste is ok , but no flavor in particular jumps out . palate is immediately too dry , not bitter enough , and slightly metallic . nice try , but not there .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	a : pours a thick tan head that quickly fades . beautiful jet-black color . s : very estery aroma , slightly soy-like . t : the taste is overall quite burnt and dry . more ester flavors than i would expect from a dry stout . a sour , ash-like taste , perhaps with a hint of banana , is followed by a harsh kick upon swallowing . the burnt aftertaste lingers . m : very astringent , almost like an oatmeal stout . medium body . d : overall , this did n't seem like a balanced beer . one flavor dominated : burnt .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	thanks ewright ! a : a hazy orange color . me thinks this is bottle conditioned given all the haze.. nice white head , that dissipates into a white ring . s : some booze in there . sweet with berry and wine notes . there is a bit of a bready/flour scent in here as well . something floral and slightly earthy in this . wondering if it is the hops . a beer i could spend a while sniffing , and keep finding new things in . t : strong berry flavors , sweet , and some definite yeast character . this almost has a sweet champaign thing going on . good , but a bit sweet . m : medium bodied , carbonation is pretty good . very dry . d : tasty , but almost cloying . i definitely enjoyed trying this out .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	glass : snifter temp : cellared @ approx 45 degrees this is perfect appearance for a stout . it 's as black as black can be . it has a thick head of creamy , fluffy , brown foam . so thick that it tried to escape the top of the glass , in a vertical manner . the head takes a long while to recede to a nice thick surface covering , over an 1/8th of an inch thick . the lacing is almost like curtains . visually , this is quite an impressive beer . the nose is not perfect , but it 's still very good . big notes of maltiness , filled with dark roasted coffee notes . a wonderful lacto sweetness . light hints of milk chocolate , vanilla and cocoa powder . a lightly earthy , almost woody quality lies over the whole thing . a great big presence of roastiness dominates this one . some mild lacto sweetness with a touch of vanilla caramels . notes of dark chocolate-covered espresso roast coffee beans . a very light spicey kiss of hops helps this finish nicely dry . full-bodied . very smooth , goes down easy , with a medium level of creaminess . carbonation level may be just a touch too much , but it 's still quite tasty . this is a great example of what a good stout should be . it 's deliciously smooth and easy drinking . the abv is very well hidden , also . this is my first offering from pelican and i want more .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.50	a-poured into my dogfish head signature glass . i gave this a quick pour and came away with a one finger head that slowly dissipated to a wisp of foam around the edges . light red/amber is the best color to describe this one . s- my initial passes in the glass i picked up some bourbon and a tart smell that i have to say is the oak character from the barrel . with a little time in the glass i start to pick up more bourbon and realized the tart smell was mellowed out bourbon . not the most impressive smelling beer , but not bad . t- picking up lots of hops in this one . i had heard this one was pretty hot and i was hoping it was the bourbon , but the hotness is mostly hops . a nice hoppy/bourbon aftertaste was left to linger for longer than most beers . the bourbon does show through , but not as prominently as i would expect in a bal beer . m : had a fair amount of carbonation , with a med/thin body . the carbonation level was good , but i prefer a `` chewier '' bw . less carbonation and more body would help this one a lot . as it warmed up it started to pick up a creamy feel . o : i have not had wooden hell but have to imagine it surpasses this beer . although this did not live up to the hype , it was still quite drinkable . i 've had arctic devil and abacus in the past couple weeks and both were better in my opinion . i 'm hoping some time in the bottle will mellow out the hops and allow the bourbon to shine . only time will tell .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	copper color with a quickly disapating white head . aroma of cranberries , clove and fruit . taste is sweet and very fruity having a dry tart aftertaste with a medium mouthfeel . as the beer warmed in the glass it became more tart over the fuitiness . a good one to try , not as fruity as a lambic , but just enough to let you know it 's still a beer .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	it is a great tragedy to me that almost every bar with any microbrews at all will have at least one or two by dogfishhead , and yet i almost never see indian brown on supply . why must we continue to suffer 60 minute ipa instead ? to me this makes indian brown a highly under-rated beer which does n't get enough attention . this brew has a strong coffee impression which i do n't see mentioned on this site much - it has too much roasty malt flavor to come across as an ipa or scotch ale derivative . feels more like a porter or stout . i have confirmed this with both beer fans and casual drinkers alike - give a sip to a random girl at a party and she 'll probably anounce `` weird , it tastes like starbucks ! '' that brings me to my only criticism though - that this brew is inconsistent . i used to drink it weekly , and sometimes it would taste sweet and malty , other times more hoppy and rough . that would explain for the varying accounts of this beer across different reviews . it is also something of a gateway - as good as it is , once you have access to better brews with the same characteristics ( i.e . old rasputin stout ) there 's not a whole lot of reason to go back to the indian brown . nevertheless , i continue to find myself eying the dogfish bottles at random bars i go to , just in case this is hiding among them .

0.40 0.50 0.70 0.30 0.40	another can given by dkachur . what a guy ! a : it 's strange how this style looks so identical in almost every way . i suppose that the same could be said for most any style , though . honestly , though , this one almost looks a little brighter than some others ... in some ways , it is kinda true to urine . quick forming head , just as quick to disappear . s : there seems to be a rich scent of corn coming from this one , along with a soft grain . it 's not a horrible scent , but certainly not great , either . t : grains , corn , and a slightly sour flavour , as it warms just the slightest , it becomes rather unpleasant ... it was poured just minutes ago and is already showing negative qualities . m + d : a sharp carbonation , with a bit of foaminess on the way down . body has a little bit to it , at least for the style . it 's unfortunate that the flavour seems to go downhill so quickly . it could have potential as a lawnmower beer , but this is more a choice to simply get drunk and guzzle .

0.20 0.30 0.40 0.30 0.30	appearance - weirdly off-color , looks almost greenish . otherwise typical light macro - thick , quick-dying , soapy foam , extremely clear , fizzy , etc . smell - adjuct smell , but stronger and worse than most . kinda sickly sweet , vegetable odor . taste - candy sweet without a hint of hops . this does not pass for beer . i 'm not going to rank it lower because the taste isn ' t actively offensive . mouthfeel - waaatery ; no fullness whatsoever . little bit of carbonated tang , but even this is somewhat lacking . drinkability - hey if you 're in a desert or out at sea and dying of thirst , this stuff 'll go down pretty easy . absent such an occasion , however , this `` beer '' goes in the only for enemies list . quite frankly , this stuff is borderline not beer . what in the hell are those golden , co. folks up to ? the coors products i 've tasted are simply unacceptable . this beer itself may be the worst beer i 've sampled .

1.00 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	12 oz . bottle , 4.5 % abv . pours a cloudy yellow/gold color , with a huge thick fluffy white head . a good deal of carbonation helped this head hold for what seemed like an eternity . aroma is floral , grassy , spicy , and a bit funky . a few citrus notes in the background . near the end , the aroma seemed to become perfumey . soft carbonation gives this a great mouthfeel , almost creamy . a bit of tartness , followed by some earthy spices , and lingering lemon zest . great patches of lace are left clinging to the glass as i drink this brew . lingering earthy and grassy bitterness . there is a bit of funky flavor that hits as you raise the glass to your lips . seemed just a bit harsh for me , which hurts the drinkability somewhat . overall , pretty good .

0.80 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30	a : a nice clear bright yellow . a white puffy head . lots of carbonation . s : arghh . this took be aback . very foul smelling . skunky . the beer was fresh ( 3 months old ) enough . either this was a bad bottle ... or a bad beer . t : same as the smell . skunky . m : thin ... fizzy . o : very disappointed . drainpour .

1.00 0.70 0.20 0.20 0.20	a - wow . i 've had a lot of scotch ales before , but never one that poured this dark and thick . its like pouring a ris . good amount of carbonating . head dies down , but a film remains . s - roasted peat smoked malts ... .almost a bbq smell . faint sweetness from a dark fruit . t - ah crap , its infected . surprising it was n't on the nose ... . tart cherry flavor ... mouthfeel is thin ... damn , i had high hopes . i 'd love to try this fresh/uninfected .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	bottle at a sushi restaurant . did n't catch the size as the server poured it 2 ways and then took the empty away , but it was the 'big one ' . hazy straw-colored body with a fizzy white head that tails off fairly quickly , leaving little opportunity for much in the way of lacing . a tart burst of citrus- lemon juice and orange zest- greets the nose , backed up with cloves , tangy wheat and tangy yeast . tastes much like it smells , with the additions of brief moments of earthiness and a lemon-lime soda sweet character . a bit of a band-aid aftertaste , particularly as it gets warmer , but not enough to be too distracting . light and almost wispy on the tongue with a clean finish , it made a pretty nice match for the sushi .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	this beer pours a gorgeous clear deep orange amber color with a 3 finger ( on an easy pour ) of offwhite/tannish thick sudsy head . the head retention on this was ridiculous ! thick clumps of sticky lacing left on the sides of the glass the entire way down . nose is of grapefruit and orange citrusy hops , some caramel malt notes filter in in the background . taste is caramel malts at the beginning , then moving in to some spice and grapefruit hops . the malt then makes a resurgence with some roasted and graininess to it . in the finish is a tad soapy ( on my second glass i washed out and tried again but the soap was still there ) . this is an incredible beer . medium bodied , medium carbonation , crisp feel goes down easily , drier finish . this is highly drinkable and another great offering from nogne !

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.50	as there was no pop at all from this bottle , i will purchase at some point and re-review . poured from a bottle in to my portsmouth tulip glass . pours a orangy yellow with hints of amber floating around . the head was no where to be found on this particular bottle as was the entire bottle very flat . the aroma was hard to detect but was very sweet . the taste again was extremly sweet and carried a funk to it . the mouthfeel was very smooth as there was no carbonation to the drink . i would hesitate on purchasing this particular brew again , the overly sweet tones were not suited to my taste buds . will try to grab a fresh pint somewhere to compare and re-review .

1.00 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	its worth trying this beer to just watch the pour . it has a head that goes on and on and on . but after the pour it goes downhill . hardly andy aroma to wet your tastebuds and it was a very bland and like a previous post said boring beer ... ... cheers

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 1.00	a - pours a very dark brown - almost black - with a two-finger , well-carbonated , beige head that slowly dissipates to a 1 cm head . very attractive drink , as well as bottle which is slightly shorter and wider than most 12 oz bottles . s - smells coffee-like and malty with a hint of chocolate poking its head through . the smell is pretty strong , but very appetizing . t - stong taste . hoppy and coffee-like . faintly chocolatey with a slightly bitter , but pretty nice , aftertaste . m - nice consistency and decent thickness to it . goes down very smooth . d - i like sierra nevada porter a lot and could have a number of them in one sitting , either with or without a meal . it is not extremely filling , yet it is not as weak as some of the light beers out there . it even retains all of its flavor , smell , and deliciousness as it slowly loses its coldness while in your glass/bottle . a truly excellent beer

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured into a pint glass , this turned out to be a really beautiful beer . it was an amber color with a thick off-white head that persisted throughout the time it took me to drink the beer . there was an amazing amount of lacing . the aroma was fresh rye bread . the rye dominated the taste , making it a fairly dry beer . a little bit of spice present also . enjoyed this beer .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a small snifter . no head and no lacing after being poured . very little carbonation almost flat . vanilla flavor is all but lost . very noticeable tinny , metal flavoring . flat mouthfeel because of lack of carbonation . very disappointing compared to other times i have had this brew . flavor does n't live up to its porter profile .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.70	cloudy ( though not much ) and dark gold , weak head of white . aroma is citrusy , lightly grassy and piney , i also detect peaches , oh so good . taste : bitter , grainy aftertase , i like it . i feel preserved by the hops . it feels spicy , and tingly . you notice it all the way down . i would usually want to put away a few of these , of course it would get the better of me , but darn it it 's good .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.30 0.40	there are a group of beers that are often cited as being beers for people that do n't like beer . that wild blue is often cited at the top of this list just goes to show that if you do n't like beer , chances are that any beer you 'll like wo n't taste like it . wild blue certainly does n't . visually , wild blue at least looks the part . it pours a nice , two-finger purple head and there 's abundant lacing as you swill it down . the beer itself is a deep purple-brown color . if i were to judge a beer by looks alone , you 'd think that wild blue blueberry lager is a good one . unfortunately for ab , taste is ultimately king when it comes to beer . the smell is where you start to detect that there 's something wrong . it 's very fruity , but not in a natural way . if you want to think of an artificially flavored drink , kool-aid , welch 's grape `` juice '' or generic grape `` drank , '' you 're on the right track . it 's not really unpleasant , but it really does n't smell natural . it 's almost as if ab had brewed regular old macro-lager and added artificially-flavored blueberry syrup to it . once you start to drink it , you know something is wrong . it 's drinkable enough i suppose , but you have to remind yourself that you 're drinking beer , at least for as long as it 's cold . once , it warms up a bit , you start to notice the malt-liquor like taste , but not at all in a good way . it 's very sweet and has that artificial blueberry flavor , but this is beer in name only . if there 's a positive note to add to that , it 's that it 's very hard to believe that this is an 8 % abv brew . ultimately , all i can say is that i 'm glad i like beer . if this is the swill non-beer drinkers turn to , i actually kind of feel sorry for them . if this were marketed as a flavored malt beverage , i 'd probably be a bit less harsh , but the fact that ab tries to market this along the lines of a micro-brew is insulting at best . there are good examples of fruit beer out there ( abita purple haze comes to mind , a personal favorite ) , but this surely is n't it . if you like real beer , i would advise you to steer clear , but in the event you like the idea of a brew that comes across like a blueberry soda , well , you might give it a try ( with a healthy helping of my pity ) .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.80	i 've only had one other pilsner style beers . and that experience left me weary of the style , but not being willing to let one breweries sample give testimony to the style , i tried this one on an impulse . served from a bottle into an oversized mug , this beer poured a clear , gleaming , light honey color and produce a thick white frothy head leaving very little lacing . in the mug , the beer looked a pale straw color . the head dissipated very slowly and produced a grassy , white wine like aroma with alcoholic notes . the taste of this beer was surprisingly mild , but with a complex mixture of malty , spicy , hoppy tones coming and going in succession . mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing . this beer finished dry and grassy leaving me wanting to continue to savour . this beer was easy to drink , and with its moderate alcohol content i could easily spend an afternoon with this beer . however , in that i am not fond of the `` smaller '' , beers i do n't see myself buying this beer often much keeping a stock of it in the fridge . given this experience , i will gladly continue to sample other examples of this style .

1.00 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.60	a beautiful brown with red highlights and a tan head that lasts and sticks . smell is extremely faint muted nuts , yeast , and aged english hops . flavor is also very restrained and dull . i am not looking for anything in-my-face , but this is pretty boring . medium body , low carbonation . i most likely wo n't be having this again . this is like a yeasty newcaste with more hop character . not impressed .

0.40 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.60	i good beer for a good price , and with the exception of a few flaws , a fine example of a dopple bock . poured into a pilsner glass the beer produces no head , no carbonation to speak of , and no lacing . the smell is of carmal and malt sweetness as well as chocolate and dark fruit . the taste is malty with a light to medium body with drinkability being moderate .

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	smells of sweet blueberries and malt . the taste was of the same plus and extra bite that almost tasted like the bottle itself . it had a very metallic taste to it . the blueberry flavor is strong and good . it overshadows the other flavors put into this one . average drinkablility . when i was done with it i was ready for something else but it was n't awful .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	poured a black color with good carbonatio and a tannish head . nose is whhhholly blueberry . to much berry , no enough oats . taste is pretty thin , blueberry heavy , not much oats but a roastiness going on . mouthfeel is pretty much dominated by roasted malt , hints of oats being smothered by bllueberry . no way will i try this again but someone else might dig it .

0.40 0.30 0.80 0.50 0.40	i expected a lot more from this beer . it pours with a dark golden color with amber undertones topped by a thin head with very little lacing left behind . the aroma is slightly hoppy with sweet undertones . the flavor is slightly sweet and bitter with a good balance between the hops and malt . the flavor and aroma are well balanced but weak and unimpressive .

1.00 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	pours a beautiful dark chocolate color that does n't allow any light to shine through . because it was in a nitro-can , the tan head is about an inch high with beautiful cascades of foam running up and down the inside of the glass . decent lacing , this is really nice to just sit back and watch for a minute . the smell is n't as great as i had hoped ; right off the bat i get whiffs of chocolate milk and some slight roasted malts , but it 's not nearly as strong as i 'd like it to be . the flavor , while good , needs to be a bit more assertive as well . a sweet , chocolate milk base with roasted malt and some chocolate covered coffee beans for a bittersweet taste . still , i did n't feel as if it was as flavorful as it could 've been . i 've definitely had better chocolate stouts . the mouthfeel is the worst part , for me . i like the look that comes from the nitro-can , but i really ca n't deal with the oily slick feel that comes from a beer with almost no carbonation in it . maybe if it was a bit thicker and more flavorful , but it 's not . the drinkability takes a bit of a hit from the mouthfeel and slightly weak flavors , but it could definitely be good if it picked it up in those two areas . i think i 'm going to have to give young 's another shot , but in the bottle next time . it 's a looker as a nitro , but i do n't care much for the mouthfeel . the beer has potential , though , so i wo n't give up .

0.80 0.30 0.40 0.30 0.20	ah , so this is the `` creamy dark lager '' . nice name . brewed with caramel , munich , carapils , chocolate , and three ( yes , 3 ! ) pale malts . hopped with cascade , cluster , and mt.hood 4.94 % abv , 170 calories per bottle . pours out to a clear , deep mahogany , forming a modest light yellow , off-beige head of microbubbles with decent retention and good lacing . carbonation is moderate . the aroma is laced with that `` domestic macrobrew '' twang , but this time in a `` creamy dark lager '' ! indeed , i do not see corn listed as an ingredient , but i sure smell it . poopy macro yeast aroma with caramelized sugar added to provide some semblance of `` dark '' aroma . i swear to god , when i swirl it , i get onions and rotting lettuce . mouthfeel is thin and fizzy with a light body . taste begins with a little bit of nothing ... medicinal caramelized sugar , wood , macro-yeast blargh , and some nice fusels that give me a headache almost instantly . bitterness tastes like the way your clothes smell after going to a smokey bar . that 's enough . i ca n't take any more . down the sink it goes . a belch tastes like nag champa . `` highest quality '' , `` hand-crafted in small batches '' . poop on you mr.leiny , your beer sucks .

0.40 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70	the best japanese beer i 've had ... although that does n't say much ... perhaps the really good japanese beers are only available in japan ? appearance : clear/yellow . minimal head smell : just about nothing at all . you 've really got to whiff hard to get find anything . taste : well it 's pretty dry , as it claims to be , it 's crisp , and i definitely enjoyed that . but really , there 's nothing too distinct or enjoyable here . mourthfeel : thin drinkability : well , again , it 's the best japanese beer i 've had . if i 'm at my favorite japanese karaoke i might have this again , but otherwise it 's not something i 'll look for .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	33cl bottle poured into a grimbergen chalice bottle ref l311012 a- mahogany body with garnet highlight . lots of sediment poured in . 2 finger tan head reduces instantly . no lacing and no head retention at all . s- light cocoa note , hint of vanilla . very subtle though , this only really came through as the beer warmed up . t- subtle notes again . cocoa comes through but i cant really pick out anything else before the dry finish and alcohol kick . m- high carbonation , cola like levels ! d- 2nd rochefort beer i have had and 2nd time im completely underwhelmed . i realise this is an older bottle but at 9.2 % abv i would expect it to hold up and have some complexity retained . to me this is over carbonated , bland with a noticeable alcohol kick on the tongue . ill need to hunt down a fresh bottle , looking at other reviews of these beers , im not drinking the same ones .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.90	served in it 's glass this was cloudy golden yellow , inch and a half white head with retention and lacing . lots of fast rising little bubbles . nose is lemon and yeast . taste is of clove , yeast , malts , grassy , fresh , and citrus . finish is wheat . i 'm not getting too much banana here . medium thin mouthfeel , but it does coat a little . champagne like carbonation . very drinkable and refreshing .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90	this beer ai n't no kstritzer . that 's a compliment . it is n't the best in its field , but damn , if it ai n't good . crisp and clean as a dark beer can be , but all that without sacrificing the full taste and body of a dark , dark beer . mmmm . i learned to drink beer on kstritzer , and i learned to love beer with klsch and this beer falls right in the middle of the two . well , not quite middle . 90 % the former with 10 % the latter to balance things out . mmmm lecker !

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.60	on tap at big daddy 's burger bar in ballantyne poured into a skull coast pint glass . a : hazy dark brown color , ( which i 'm assuming is chill haze ) with very little off white head . s : chocolate and not much else . maybe slight nuttiness and coffee in the background . t : overwhelming chocolate with slight coffee and some nuttiness in the finish . seems like most of this beer 's flavor comes from hazelnut extract and cocoa nibs . not necessarily a bad thing , but not really my style . this is a very sweet beer in my opinion . m : medium to heavy body . carbonation seems just about perfect for the style . d : i had 2 and that was plenty for me . as a funny addendum to this review , i noticed shortly after i posted it that i was removed from skull coast 's facebook page . not saying there is a connection , but it 's a mighty strange coincidence . i attempted to add them again and was denied . i attempted to contact them to see why i was being blacklisted and got no response . it 's kind of sad because i liked their other beers and love to support local breweries , but will probably steer clear of them from now on since they do n't seem to like constructive criticism .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.80	pours a semi darkish golden color , wispy looking head , kind of gives the appearance of a thin beer . lets hope the rest fares better . aroma is actually about a 50 50 blend of slightly predominately citric hops and a malt smell rising out of the glass , definitely more malt than i usually smell with american ipa 's . nothing earth shattering going on here so far . taste is of grassy hops with some lighter earthy malts . tastes more like some american pale ales i 've had ( legend pale ale ) . overall it has a very grassy feeling with some hop bitterness peeping through in the aftertaste . medium bodied , great bitterness , definitely the best part of this beer . drinkability is good , the bitterness is just the right level . average in every sense of the word . not terrible though , and beats the alternatives in the town my parents live when i visit . still , much better options are out there .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60 0.60	as far as beers go , this one struck me as very unimpressive to look at . as soon as i poured , i was overcome by the head , which at one point was about half the glass . the color is a maple amber , crystal clear , and with tons of carbonation on the sides and bottom of the glass . it looked more like a root beer , or maybe a food-colored macro . the head only looked pleasant once it had died down to about half a centimeter , and actually left a good deal of lace . the smell was metallic off the bat , although i was able to uncover some hidden honey malts with a touch of hops , after some searching . the taste was a bit watery , although this would probably be the strongest point of the beer . it is unimpressive on the front of the pallate , but it divulges a few malty flavors on the back , released by the carbonation . mouthfeel is high in carbonation , and watery . drinkable , fine for a round or two , but you wont see me drinking the night away with this .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	first off , the cork on this baby was barely being held in by the cage . it started sliding up as soon as the cage twisted off . an agressive pour was neither necessary nor desired to result in a glass 1/3 full of beer and 2/3 dense , off-white foam . even when it settled down , a decent crust of foam remained on top of the beer . robust carbonation , with many small bubbles . the smell was distinctive of a solid wild ale . funky , sour , hinting at sweetness . taste was a refreshing affirmation of what the aroma promised . i picked up some bittering hop on the palate , and some light malt sweetness , but overall was rewarded by a tasty and refreshing sour flavor that i have enjoyed on much more expensive beers . mouthfeel was full without being cloying . finish was dry and bitter , leaving me wanting the next sip , even when there was no more to be had . a very good wild ale for an excellent price . i will definitely return to the store for more .

0.90 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.60	a : always love the look of a good nitro-poured stout . a bit of translucent dark ruby around the edges . s : first stout i 've smelled ( excepting a bad bottle of a cream stout ) that was n't pleasant . smelled earthy and like a cheap red wine , which was good . but it had some sort of funky smell on top of this that i could n't place . t : i think that i hope/expect stouts to be thick and full of flavor . first started drinking them living over in the uk and did n't realize that the same brews ( e.g. , guinness ) are significantly more watery and less flavorful in the us . this beer was pretty watery and the main flavor i could detect was of earthy pine . m : again , less thick than i would expect a stout . maybe , however , i need to drink more dry stouts to compare this with . d : maybe i need to give this one another shot . it seemed pretty flavorless to me , but perhaps the stuff i got had gone bad , as the place i went -- the napa valley grille -- did n't specialize in beer . they advertised it as `` beamish dark '' , which i assume is this beer .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	brought back from virginia ( ! ) by my brother . thanks bro ! bottle has a packaged-on date of august 14 . appearance -a slightly cloudy pale , golden pour ( into my kona brewery shaker pint ) . not much of a head-no lacing to speak of . smell -sweet lightly malty nose . a bit floral . taste - pretty good . malty , slightly sweet with a hint of spicy hops in the center ( saaz , maybe ? ) . no discernable corn taste like in many beers of this style . mouthfeel - pretty highly carbonated which , as i hear it , is a local preference ( kona being the locale ) . drinkability- not bad for an american-style lager . comments- i 've been a fan of kona beers since my first visit to the big island . not my favorite offering from them , but true to style and drinkable .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.70	i received a bottle of this in my easter pack from nlmartin , and one in a trade from cresant . thanks ! pours a brownish amber color , cloudy , and with a faint head . aromas are floral , pine like , and there is a hint of carmel . taste is thick , big mouthfeel on this one . beer starts with a kick of alcohol , and some malty brown sugar like flavors . there is a bitter and crisp hoppy finish . flavors do seem a bit flat and fleeting . ( except for the bitterness that sticks around for a bit ... ) overall , this beer hits and misses on different levels . the flavors seem a bit too flat . and nothing really stands out except the bitter finish . it 's a good beer , but i 've had better . worth a try , and if nothing else ... it 's a pretty interesting beer to taste .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.60	i was at costco the other day and saw the kirkland beer case . $ 18 for a case - good i 'll save 60 bucks this week drinking this beer . the appearance is a nice looking bronze color . good looking off white head and thin lacing . the smell was not that interesting for such a pretty looking beer . i 'll have my wife smell the next one i open she has a nose of a blood hound . if there is something interesting in the aroma it is behind the clean soap water scent . i have to admit i did not have great expectations for this purchase . i do n't know if i even had good expectations . but , i really wanted this one to be good at least . nope , the fresh water smacks you with your first sip and all the others . buy a case of sprite - it atleast tastes better . a slight boring hop note and a little malt note . one sip i thought it tasted like a tin cup . another sip i thought i tasted something i had before ... . water ! mouthfeel : it does leave a little tingling on the tongue . it does leave a taste on the palate from the hops and malts that is thin and the flavor left behind is a tin cup bite . eat something with this or smoke but , do something while you drink this beer . it needs help . while eating pizza or a sub you could down a few of these . the watery style will refresh your palate and the food my help the taste . that is why i gave it a 3 for drinkability . by itself - i will not do again . matter of fact the two kirkland beers i have had so far - i lost my $ 18 on this purchase . not all is lost - my wife may like these beers ! ! !

0.30 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.60	this poured a yellow color with some white head . it practically has no smell , maybe some grain . tastes like a watered-down lager with a little flavor here and there . it is light-bodied as per the style with plenty of carbonation . all that said , this brew goes down easy ! this is the most drinkable beer i 've had . it is actually refreshing at times , especially after doing yard work .

0.30 0.60 0.90 0.50 0.80	it pour extraordinarily clear into a glass . way too clear . not much of a head . some would call it a skunk smell , though those of us who know that is by design will say otherwise . but , the smell is rather too strong . taste ? really watery . american light beers have more on this beer . very drinkable with absolutely no aftertaste . i can not describe how much this beer has no aftertaste . verdict : not worth a buy when you can get better at a cheaper price . **edited** this beer went flat before i was through with it . i am a power drinker and did not sip this beer slowly . look , i know some comments are inappropriate , but as a well educated business man , i find these comments to not be out-of-line when i say this beer cut corners on its carbonation . it is typical ( not a prejudice , but a known fact in the professional business world and far into the mainstream ) that chinese business are notorious to cut corners . that may work with billion chinese population , but in america we are subject are own free will and can buy another beer from just about anywhere in the world . i had to knock down my results across the board except smell by -0.5 .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.90	pours out light gold with decent head , and very heavy signs of carbonation . smells very light with some hint of hops . almost no taste except for the bitter alcohol that may follow , but for the most part very watery . it is , however , quite refreshing . because of its lack of flavor and the fact that it 's so light , it 's drinkability is quite high . overall , refreshing but not a beer-lover 's beer . not the best light beer , but not the worst .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.80	appearance : very dark , as the name would suggest ... but some brown tinge . quite a nice head , with moderate retention and nice lace . smell : the sweetish/bitter combination of toasted malt and bitter cocoa/burnt coffee is quite memorable . taste : this is an ipa worth trying , mostly due to the heavy and sweet presence of toasted malts . the bitterer hop presence follows up , along with a bitter cocoa taste . the feel in the mouth is thickish and full . overall , immensely drinkable , but perhaps not quite as nicely complex as some other options ... like dogfish head 's 190minute ipa .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.90 0.80	poured from 12oz bottle to pint glass . a : pours a hazy light orange with a small off-white head with poor retention and no lacing . s : strong wheat and a bit of fruit , bananas possibly . t : fruity ( bananas , pears , and berries ) pretty wheaty with a small amount of hops . pretty complex for a wheat beer , very similar to a triple ... go figure . overall : very drinkable and well carbonated but nothing out of the ordinary in that aspect . unique wheat beer though for sure , i would have sworn it were a triple .

0.30 0.30 0.50 0.40 0.40	thank you richard for giving me the opportunity to review this beer . i entirely appreciate the bottle and the brewery 's efforts , that being said : bourbon barrel aged sour , lug nut lager , skyscrape brewing company ( el monte , ca ) bottle # 341 of 372 , hand signed appearance : from the outset i am suspicious of this alleged lager because it doesnt have any other adjectives akin to lagers and it looks as reluctant as a craigslist casual encounters endeavor . it is just languid and sits there , supplicant but distasteful . it is deep yellow , mellow gold and the carbonation looks like a crestfallen 8th birthday party with lacing streamers applied with judicious alacrity . s : the smell of this beer reminds me of white zinfandel , toffee run over by a car , and a caramel kiss left in the microwave in a plastic container too long . my left eye does this staccato glitch like wild animals when they eat a monarch butterfly . i feel like this wont be getting better , like the third season of one tree hill . t : ok , to be fair , the tart bite is there at the outset , its like they used a simple sour mashing technique or maybe a poorly monitored spontaneous fermentation but the overall taste is not entirely offputting . that old toffee that i was mentioning earlier , voltrons up into full on wethers original . the buttery coating is like a cruel jelly belly of the experimental kind . the butteriness is not unlike lindsay lohans complexion in execution . it seems like this is getting worse with age , much like lindsay loh- well , moving on . m : the mouthfeel for the first half second is pretty awesome and is almost like ok guys , wow this is kinda like supplica- ok no , thats , vagina , a buttery vagina taste , wait wow . so , if you have that memento disease and you can only recall the last .5 seconds , then i guess , this is the beer.for you ? you probably shouldnt be drinking on that many meds though . d : again , this comes down to the user . would you perform cunnilingus on a clown ? do you absolutely hate the tastes of butterscotch and regret ? if not , then this might be your jam . its tough to blast it too , because it feels like something i would try , not the clown sex , the brewing . i look at the hand signed bottle , the numbered limited batch and then i just sit in my tower , acting like i used to be something . well fine , i cant put clown vagina in a bottle , but i can criticize , and well , here we are mumra . time for some hooo .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	got this one from ckeengan04 , thanks buddy , this is an excellent beer ! a - it 's impossible to score higher , beautiful beer ... thick fluffy white head that resembles the frothed milk of a latte , dark gold to light copper , carbonation rains towards the head ... such a beautiful looking beer . s - some phenolic spiciness , banana esters and light grainy malt ... . hop note seems nonexistent but could be mistaken for the phenolic aroma . very balanced , no one aroma overpowers the others ... . very subtle and enjoyable . t - grainy pilsner malt note is balanced with a medium bitterness alongside spicy phenolic notes ( think clove like ) and light hints of banana . much like the aroma suggests , this beer is very very well balanced without one flavor stomping another ... i crave the next sip as i put the chimay goblet down ... . m - light and creamy as it enters and like a morning sunrise , the carbonation picks up and brightens up the palate . no astringency , not cloying whatsoever . d - one word can describe this beer . phenomenal . wonderfully subtle , amazingly drinkable , this beer is sure to please . do not expect an in your face brew , the beer has a million subtle notes and is meant to be savored , sit back deep into an adirondack chair , watch the sun set with this beer accompanying you . yeah , its that kind of beer .

0.20 0.40 0.20 0.20 0.20	received as a gag gift . and like any good practical joke , this has me simmering for revenge . pours dilute yellow , with the pepper lodging in the neck halfway and difficult to remove . no head to speak of whatsoever . nose of corn syrup and chiles . i guess it smells pretty close to how i imagined it would . tastewise , it begins with that same flourish of corn-fed sweetness , then it 's vaporized by a fiery vegetal , pepper blast . waxy and uncomfortable . if there is anything else here ( and i seriously doubt it ) , it is cloaked in full by the heat . the heat subsides over time ( or at least is acclimated to ) , but then nothing is left other than that wax-coated veggie sense , and tacky , sugared tortillas . thin bodied , fiercely hot up front , and painful to drink . it burns the lips , then the entrance to the throat . sink bound . this is as bad as avertised ... worse , probably .

0.80 0.20 0.80 0.30 0.30	a= the pour is a nice deep golden color with a crispy white head on it that holds some decent retention and lacing . s= damn it skunk ! it smells like skunk and rotten wood . i really wish they would do something to prevent this . i can smell the pungent skunk from a few feet away . sort of mustardy too . t= the taste is n't as skunky as the smell for some reason yet it is still bad . the taste is overly sweet and skunky . luckily the sweetness takes a little of the skunk away or i would be lost . this is just too bad . m= clean crisp and refreshing . d= i really wish i could have found a bottle of this that is n't skunked . i 'm reviewing it because i paid for it . they should take more care into keeping this problem away .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.20 0.40	this beer was bought directly from the brewer at a farmers market . to be fair this beer looks pretty good when you give it a hard pour . the first bottle did n't come to much but i gave the second a lot of agitation on the way into the glass and it came up with a nice tight head that stuck around a bit and laced pretty nicely . add to that a nice crystal clear golden colour and you 've got a decent looking beer . oh dear . once you smell this beer things start to go wrong . instead of punget hop aroma all i get is musty dampness and metalic aroma , very odd for a beer i believe to be super fresh . mouthfeel is actually about bang on for a drinkable pale ale style beer . there appears to be more carbonation in the mouth than is evident when poured . the taste is god damn awful . it has a really nasty cub kinda taste that has so little to do with pale ale that i ca n't begin to describe . there is a hint of fruit but it 's over powered by a horridly dry nasty flavour that i ca n't quite pin . i 'm grimmacing just to taste it . i 'm strugling to even believe this was brewed with an ale yeast . seems to me to taste like industrial lager at this point on my second bottle . overall this is a dreadful beer and i so wanted it to be good after talking to the brewer . i love supporing local breweries but i ca n't recomend this . the rest of this glass is going down the drain and i may not even force the rest of the six pack on guests .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.70	several years old , courtesy sharing with steve ( beerhugger ) . an aroma of a very aged beer . the color of beige , lots of foam . a vinegary cidery taste , but better than a cantillon . i could only sip this in between other food and drink . still significant carbonation . great for what it is .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.40 0.40	poured a deep amberish brown with lots of carbonation and abid dirty white head that took a while to simma down . nose is pretty faint , caramel , chocolate and some sweetness . taste is pretty damn simple and underwhelming . as my friend pinted out it seemed to be more of a extract based barleywine from the taste , much like my homebrew barleywine but perhaps with less taste . i picked up a bit of caramel , chocolate malt , no big hops and nothing to really distinguish it or make me want more . simple and uninspiring .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.60	poured in a pint glass ... appearance -beer pours with next to head that disappears quickly , lacing is ever present . carbonation on pour was extreme then died off to almost none . overall , golden hazy looking beer . smell - very good smelling beer , slight sweetness and some grains , overall very good . taste - nice tasting beer , almost no aftertaste and goes down smooth . almost a hint of sweetness with some min grains/hops . mouthfeel - carbonation is activated in the mouthfeel , adds a little punch to the taste and a little bitterness on the last sip . drinkability - i found this to be a nice beer , overall good tasting and light on the mouth !

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60	a - this thing is like the abyss ! there is no light coming through and no apparent haze . in the very bottom of my glass , i can see rust colored highlights coming through . the head is creamy looking and a very inviting light brown that makes me think of `` mocha '' for some reason . s - almost smells like a beefed-up guiness , maybe a slight tang ... not exactly what i was expecting . not much hop aroma , not much roast/coffee and really not much malt either . the nose is not very enticing t - i ca n't tell if this is infected or not and will have to compare to others ' notes ... it tastes like a beefed-up guiness , which is not saying a whole lot . i just get dry , metallic , slightly tangy black ale with non-descript flavors . there is still a balance of malt and bitterness i guess . m - ok . the balance of body and carb is actually pretty good , which makes me think it 's not infected . for right now , good mouthfeel o - i 'll revisit just to see if this bottle is bad . has some potential , but not tapping into it right now .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.90 1.00	pours a deep , dark muddy ruby topped by a large bubbled head . the head retention is fantastic on this . great lacing . the aroma is sour cherries and beechwood . almost vinous . the maltiness builds . the taste is like cream soda in its sweetness . no . it reminds me a lot of the strawberry pop i used to love as a kid . very dry and woodsy in the finish . sweet and fruity without being cloying thanks to a sour cherry taste and just a hint of balsamic vinegar . dry and velvety at the same time . the balance is a little off in the sweet to sour ratio in favour of the sweet . some lingering toastiness in the aftertaste . somewhat reminiscent of cranberry juice . it 's medium bodied with a perfect level of carbonation . there 's something very creamy about this . overall an interesting beer with some sherry like characteristics present in the aroma and taste . it 's complex and full flavoured while at the same time very approachable . i 'd definitely get this again .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured a dark brown colour with bright ruby highlights . the carbonation in this is tremendous . i had to pour it three separate times because the head would overflow . aroma of fruit , mangoes , grain and yeast . this is a smooth and crisp ale . hints of fruit , particularly mango and grapes . some sweetness , and a touch of spice . easy drinking , alcohol well hidden .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.70	pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace . crystal clear amber color . good carbonation and medium bodied . piney grapefruit nose . flavor is sweet grapefruit , piney hops and some caramel . higher abv totally hidden . and the ridiculous 135 ibus are just about balanced . really lingering piney hop aftertaste . $ 5.99 for a 22oz bottle from beverage warehouse winooski , vt .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours to a thin off-white head and a solid clear brown color . aroma is a nice mixture of fruity esters and buttery malt . flavor is heavy on the malt flavors with just enough hops to even it out . there are dark specialty malts all over the flavor , giving it a complex malt profile that develops as it warms . good smooth mouthfeel due to low carbonation . easy to quaff . good stuff .

0.40 0.70 0.90 0.90 0.80	from the fascinating colonial recipe collection , this will be served just over fridge temperature in a pint glass . appearance- before we even pour , i have to mention the chunks of what seem to be lemon peel resting at the bottom of the bottle ... this should be quite an exciting ride ... ... well , maybe not . resembling diet cream soda , the pale gold liquid screams with a crackly , thin rim of bubbles that disappear completely within ten seconds . looking like yesterday 's beer that i left out on the counter to die , it contains some tiny floaties that hover weightlessly within . a painfully flat and lackluster appearance . smell- ginger ... and lots of it . i love this herb and all that it stands for ... longevity , its properties regarding the immune system , and its unique flavor . there is a trace of honey in the nose , but it 's all about the former ingredient . taste- a delicious and satisfying treat that incorporates two bold , distinct characters and somehow manages to present them in harmony and total balance . the finishing pour , swirling in all sediment and particles , gives this beer a parting sweetness that was n't there before . delicious , refreshing , daring , an enigma that i hope to sample again . mouthfeel/drinkability- excellent slickness , keeping the overall texture light and pleasing . a good *whish* sends this beer bobsledding across the mouth , exhibiting a masterful intergration of flavor that must have taken long hours to perfect . for the style , a terrific palate pleaser that i hope resurfaces again for all to try .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.80	picked up a couple of these delights from the boise coop on my trip there a couple weeks ago . not sure how much i paid but i guarantee it was less than other places . drank from my stone india pale ale flute . appearance- pours a super clear bright yellow with a nice big two finger heavenly white head . lots of aggressive bubbly carbonation gives this a very champaign look . beautiful cap and collar that remains the entire brew leaving some lacing . smell- quite fruity with some honeydew melon and slightly zesty lemon . i do n't get much of the orange peel but might be from the dominating coriander . really spicy as well with somewhat of a white peppery kick . very little yeast is noticeable but there is a tad bit of a somewhat familiar candy maltiness . taste- a bit more subdued than i was expecting but tasty none-the-less . a bit of sweetness to start that is grainy and thin with some underlining fruitiness . not at all any sort of a tart fruit , just some mellow cantaloupe and those grains of paradise . some coriander and banana are discernable towards the end but they 're rather subtle . mouthfeel- fairly thin with a nice crisp bite from the moderately aggressive carbonation . drinkability- overall this is n't too shabby . i 'm a huge fan of deschutes and they usually put out terribly drinkable beers . if i was to change something though i think i 'd tone down the spices just a hair . at least the coriander and grains of paradise ( just not a huge fan ) . definitely worth a shot though if you run into one .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.60	c'est what fall festival 2010 , significantly hopped cask . light colour , yellowish tinge . subtle papaya flavours . faint aromas . medium mouthfeel . reasonable but not overally drinkable.worth the experiment though , as this brewery has ventured out there before .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.70	a - classic dark bronze doppelbock color . rich beige head that lingers . s - sweetness , some dark , brooding roasty notes , a slight whiff of alcohol and spice . t - malt bomb ! a bit one dimensional in that respect - approaches cloying levels but does n't get there which is admittedly is nice . rich , robust malty sweetness with middle notes of roasted barley and backend of ever so slight hops and a good dose of alcohol . finishes wet and sweet . it just lacks a certain depth and complexity of flavor that other doppels i like better have ( such as herby notes , yeasty notes , and a more elegant approach balancing out the malts ) m - very good . thick and voluptious . d - its drinkable but strong and sweet . so its not something i would drink all night long but definitely something i get every time i 'm at the german bar after a few pints of a nice pilsner .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.80	got this beer in a slovak pub from my ( potential ) father-in-law . the beer was served in a stein glass . the color is dark brown , almost black , with a beautiful light-brown , creamy and thick head , that reduced to a nice thin lacing after several minutes . the smell was somewhat weak , sweet brown sugar and some hints of roasted and caramelized malts . i thought i smelled some dough in there . the taste was much better than the smell . sweet , creamy , roasted malts , coffee , dark chocolate , very weak taste of alcohol , hints of brown sugar with a very long lasting sweet aftertaste . mouthfeel : very light , thin , creamy and easy to drink . medium-low carbonation . overall a bit too sweet for my palate , also the taste is a bit too flat . the beer reminds me of heineken oud bruin . not bad , but i hope i will still find better beers in slovakia before i go home again , but i will not refuse another one in the future .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	i bought a six pack of miller chill to go with some tacos on a camping trip . a lot of people wo n't like this beer , but for what it 's supposed to be it 's not bad . poured in to a pilsner glass . pours a very pale yellow color and is crystal clear . many bubbles are rising through the beer . a foamy white head forms and is fairly resilient , lacing the sides of the glass . smell is fruity and candy like . smells like a lime starburst candy . taste is sweet and fruity . lime flavor dominates , with a mild bitter finish . mouthfeel is crisp and clean . soda like . a little bubble gum texture maybe ? a drinkable beer , but not great . paired with average american-mexican food it 's good . if you like corona with lime but don ; t like packing or cutting the limes , this one might be for you .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	reddish-brown color , very hazy but this could be due to the fact i 'm drinking this on the east coast . great foamy head taller than normal fair aroma of citrus and spice thin on malt due to the great amount of bitterness this beer puts forward . biting hops at the end are nice but more malt would of been appropriate for the flavor and body of this brew . clean bitterness in the aftertaste allows good drinkability a good ipa that i would like to try again closer to its origins .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured into a pounder glass at a rapid pace and produced a light fizzy head that reduces to nothing quicker than tom leykis can diss a beeeeatch . faded amber coloring . as soon as i poured this a huge apple juice aroma explosion . which i imagine is a byproduct of the cypress wood aging . sweet malty , earthy grain type backdrop . first drink it comes across juicy . its a unique taste for this style . sweet body and a mellow syrupy mouthfeel with light carbonation that forgets to show up for work . almost malt liquor'ish but with flavor . it finishes a bit chalky . i liked the effort to be different and age it in wood barrells it definately is unique but thats where it ends for me . with that said i have 3 more to go in the six pack ... .not a problem .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.60	thanks fred . pours a thick black with a large mocha head . nose is very roasted malt forward with some unsweetened chocolate and vanilla . almost charred . mouth is heavily , distractingly carbonated . fairly dry up front , which i enjoy , segueing into a massively roasty , bitter finish . some nice earthy tones , but way too messy on the finish and the body is way too carbonated .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.40 0.30	pours black as night with a brown head . definitely looks the part of a big ris . the nose is lackluster - strong to be sure , but not pleasant . tons and tons of malt with a plum character . not really appealing . the taste is much of the same . loaded with roasty caramel malt and a charateristic that makes me think of plums . this is n't bad , per se , but definitely not tasty to me . when i try a beer of darkness ' acclaim , i expect some nice complexities and layers . i got none of that . this thing honestly tasted like a thicker , cloying version of old rasputin to me . mouthfeel was nice and thick and creamy . sticky . all in all , massive disappointment . even though this bottle was from the most recent vintage , i did n't get any of the hops that others are mentioning . i wish i had , since it might have balanced this mess out . i do n't imagine i 'll be trying this one again . took me almost 5 hours to finish the bottle , and i was sick to my gut afterwards . yeck .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60	light gold color with a bubbly head that dissolves right away . much more a lager in appearance than an ale . smells of cream , orange candy , and florals . also has a very orange candy flavor . honey and floral notes are also noticeable . not totally unpleasant to drink , providing you only want one . it 's way too sweet to take any deeper than that .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.60	i 've been drinking the original since i was a young boy . i finally found this at a beer warehouse in philly before a phils game . bought a 30 . a month later , i 'm still working on it . a-poured yellow with mild cloudiness and a thick head that quickly faded . carbonation was strong initially , but also slackened off rapidly . no lacing . s-grainy sweet malt and polenta , hint lemon rind at beginning that quickly faded . t-slightly sweet grain and corn flour , and finish hints at hops , mealy apple , and cornbread . m-mouthfeel is crisp and clean , and one of the aspects of this beer that renders it palatable . carbonation is pretty good for style . d-this stuff is nothing special of course , but for its price , it 's a far better value than most of the stuff out there . it 's a fair drink , it 's better than most other light beers , and it goes down smoothly . this is my go-to cheap stuff .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.90	a - a pale amber brown brew with no head and no lacing . s - grassy hops predominantly . a bit of smokey caramel malt underneath . t - there was some smokey malt , grassy hops and a faint grapefruit taste . overall the flavor was pretty mild , but rather enjoyable . m - thin , a tiny bit harsh , very refreshing . d - good , this is only a tiny bit smokey , and it has predominantly positive characteristics . an easily sessionable beer . great with food . a decent overing from an awesome establishment !

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70	unfortunately this bottle feel out of my fridge while rearranging my beer . since the cap popped open a bit i needed to drink it . that said the head was massive , which might be a result of being shaken right before being served . a . huge tan creamy head on top of a super black viscous liquid . s. lots of roasted malt - coffee , chocolate , some caramel . some bourbon and oak in the back of my nose . t. wow ! tons of bourbon up front with coffee bitterness on swallow - the bourbon completely overwhelmed any more subtle flavors on the first sip . as you adjust to the bourbon , the roasted malt flavors make an appearance , but make no mistake this is a bourbon beer . the alcohol manages to hide fairly well , though . m. thin with a fairly high level of carbonation - probably my least favorite part of the beer . with an imperial stout i expect to be chewing on the beer . d. i must say that it 's not supremely drinkable at 3 o'clock on a thursday , but most people probably wo n't be drinking it at this time . that said , as a bourbon lover i appreciate the bourbon character , but i also wish that it blended in with the other flavors a bit more .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.40 0.40	mine came in a can and it was something that i can not recommend . it poured with a rocky two fingers ' of bone-white head with low retention . the nose had a sweetish , metallic quality which was undesirable . the color was a deep-golden shade with ne-quality clarity , the mouthfeel was medium with a taste like corn and metal . not what i was after ! the finish was mildly sweet , lager-like , but mostly verboten .

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70	this brew was a bit of a disappointment , after the pour and the aroma , expectations were high . to be fair , it was one of the better porters i 've had , but porters are under-represented in the market today , in my opinion ... anyway , on to the beer . looks nearly black with about a 3/8 '' caramel colored head from a vigorous pour . aroma is excellent , of roasted coffee and toffee . flavor is also coffee , slightly burnt , toffee and malt with a hint of hops that was a bit distracting . very little lacing , needs more carbonation and a bit too thin on mouthfeel , but very drinkable , and an excellent value as well . i 'll buy it again .

0.90 0.70 0.20 0.20 0.20	poured a nice light amber with big head that lasted for quite a while . this was as good as it got ! ! ! ! the smell was all sweet with no hint of hops . smelled like pop or maybe a wine cooler . the taste was awful ! i 've tasted syrup that was n't this sweet ! this was just nasty ! someone used the term `` cough syrup '' and that describes it to a tee . mf was thick and nasty , just like cough syrup . this is not a drinkable beer ! this should be outlawed and never brewed again ! ! !

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.40 0.40	330 ml bottle , bought at real foods , edinburgh . abv is 7.5 % . deep amber coloured beer , large off-white head . unusual sweetish aroma , notes of over-ripe raspberries and pine needles , not very pleasant . the flavour is very sweet and alcoholic , piney and sugary notes . unusual beer , but is it really good ? im sorry , but this is not for me .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.30 0.40	i hesitate leaving a bad mark in the stout category , but to be honest - this one did not suit me the least bit . i could not finish the entire bottle but , learned enough from the first glass to decide not to buy this one for myself again . first off , the bottle 's label was just mesmerizing , i picked up the bottle immediately when i saw it at the liquor store and a devilish grin came into fruition as i read the beer 's name and the word `` stout . '' i saved it for a special occasion , my return from a 4th rotation in iraq , and shared it with guests along with stone irs , old raputin , and an assortment of other stouts and porters . appearance - it looked like your typical beautiful stout , dark brown that gets darker in the snifter and nice thick tan head . smell - nice . toasted malts , chocolate , coffee . i was duped by what i thought was a milk stout 's lactose smell . taste - the smile i had from the expectation quickly turned into a shocking look of `` who the hell pissed in my beer ? '' . it had a very strong sourness that i was not prepared for or wanted in my beer . i 'm sure some will love it , but spoiled milk off of a dirty dish rag is what comes to my mind . mouthfeel - it was a medium to light body if i remember correctly , but the taste destroyed any possibility of enjoyment once it hits the palate . drinkability - i could not finish the bottle even with several friends giving it a try and will not buy again unless i want to start a cool label collection .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	painted 12oz purchased at merchant 's and poured into a tulip . dark chestnut with a bubbly head of light tan that dissipates to a ring of large bubbles . fairly active carbonation . piney and somewhat citric in the nose with some of the spices mentioned on the bottle ... namely the juniper and caraway . nice spice/hop combo . dry flavors upfront with a spicy middle . i can taste the chestnuts towards the back . the chestnuts are the most notable contribution from one of the three breweries , jp . spices linger in the finish . i get more sage from tasting than i do sniffing . some slight juniper resin holds on but is nice . lots of complexity here . moderate mouth that is dry and satisfying . i could easily sip a couple more . i get the feeling this should be drank fresh and is not a cellar candidate .

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.50	pours a slightly apricot-tinged golden colour , minimal beige head , virtually none left though . still , slow carbonation . leaves a touch of lace but not much . very lacklustre appearance . slight sticky honey-style malt , maybe german influence , with slight notes of bread yeast , but not overpowering . light bitterness but does n't seem natural , and dominant character is that slightly corn-fed malt . pretty meh , again . taste is a lot more organic than i gave it credit for . flavour is quite malty and slightly earthy , genuine grain character underlying it . bit of a carbolic soda bitterness creeps through on the mid palate and turns it slightly tart , then a hint of some sort of bitter pang on the back , but not very full of character , more of an afterthought , with a very small amount of bitter hang just lingering at the coda . not impressed , but it 's not as offensive as it might have been . mouthfeel is still and lifeless . maybe a little bit of buoyancy in it but it 's dull and uninspired . overall , a lacklustre and very ordinary brew . not harsh or unpleasant to drink , but definitely lacking something : like flavour , or ingredients .

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.80	a rich and hefty , if not very good looking , dipa . presentation : 12 oz brown bottle . tongue in cheek cartoonish front label design with the illustration of a mirrored portrait . shows a smudged bottling by date ( 01//10 ) , which as per their website is bottled on december 21 , 2009 ) . notes alc . by vol . ( 10 % ) , and ibus ( 86 ) served into a tulip glass . a - pale to medium amber pour with a rather short head , poor retention , and minimal lacing with a poor surface memory . for the style , and for such a rich brew , the look is below average . s - very rich and complex hoppy nose . citrus , grapefruit , resin , and pineapple ... a predominant tropical fruit nose . t - taste follows the nose with rich hoppy sweetness , grapefruit , pine , and pineapple . intiall malt that remains pushed to the back by the hoppy range . m - medium body , medium carbonation , and a touch of a slightly dry finish . d - a good dipa , with a hefty hoppy profile , the alcohol is very well integrated and barely noticeable . notes : i can understand the unnecessary hype putting this as the next best thing to hopslam . not that founders needs any of the praise since it almost seems that they float above the ground . mind you , it is an extraordinary brewery but nobody should scape from some critical analysis and founders , good as they are , seems to get away with things others dont . this is not necessarily their fault but is surely due in part the cultural vibe that is building around them , at least in the region from where im writing . double trouble is well above an average offering , and the nose is rather close to that of hopslam , but the appearance is nowhere near it . other than that it is a great dipa without the hefty price tag , albeit not a cheap one either .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	22 ounce bottle in pint glass a : dark amber brown , fluffy head , lacing , s : bright citrus hops , spicy , smells fresh t : hops and rye malts blend together for some spice , m : lighter body , expected a real heavy beer almost like double ipa . d : easy drinker any time of the year . will drink often .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.70	12oz bottle poured in a snifter . thanks to mrandypandy for the trade ! black . opaque . evil . darker than the eyes of darth vader himself . this thing is dark ! a very small head that dissipates quickly , very brown , one of the darkest heads i 've seem . very roasty aroma to it , reminds me of toast and coffee . very thick mouth feel , it 's almost syrupy but it is n't sweet at all , it 's just so thick , smooth and almost creamy . the taste is just as you 'd expect dark coffee and maybe a hint of dark chocolate . really solid stout , amazing name and one of the coolest bottles i 've ever seen ! seek it out !

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	i had this on-tap at the brewery on march 20 , 2006 . it came in a 1 l mass , for 6.20 euros . a : clear copper , fluffy white head , good retention and lace . s : not much aroma , but a pleasant bready malt . t : caramel , bread , a little nut , hint of spice . it 's a little sweet up front & a little bitter in the end . m : moderate body and carbonation . d : 1 litre ... damn !

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.40	pours to a brilliantly clear pale golden , forming a tall soapy `` pure as the blown snow '' white , with excellent retention and lacing . great looking brew . carbonation is moderate . aroma initially of dry , dusty floral hops , freshly mown hay , grain husk , macro booze , and a faint corn sweetness . mouthfeel is bright and flittering with a light body . taste is an echo of the aroma ... dusty floral hops , hay , a very light malt body with medium bitterness , and unfortunately , a pervasive taste of nasty brooklyn water complete with chlorine . the bitterness has a grape skin harshness , with some perceptable off-alcohols and esters . yellabrau . a very average beer , and a decent representative of the style , however it 's not my thang . the empty bitterness and lack of malt body really does n't satisfy me in any way . honestly , if i was blind-folded , i would call this a product of the big three ( until it warmed up ) . i 'll pass on seconds .

0.20 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40	12 oz . bottle in a boags premium pilsner glassbarnacles of bubbles cling to the bottom third of the glass after an overly effervescent head dissipatesfor how many amstels ive had , ive never sessioned it before ( i hear some snickers from my serious drinking friends ) still , here goesthe tint is urine yellowthe aroma is unmistakable northern european mass production , although some slivers of nostalgia are embedded in that smelland then , the tin-swift rush through the mouth . no palate to speak of . the consolationand insultof this lager is simply that it cries for some sort of bar food to interact with . like ketchup , this beer shouldnt be enjoyed aloneoh well

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.60	a : pours a redish brown , maybe a super dark amber . head dissipates almost immediately , slight lacing at best s : wow , massive blast of oaky bourbon and splash of alcohol , and a fine mix of dark wine and cherries , which stick with you at the end of the nose . t : very interesting combo . reminds me of a wine and bourbon combo , oddly enough . i get molasses , a dose of spice , the hearty wooden tasty from the barrels as well . it finished off nicely with the yeasty funk at the end . dry wine like finish . interesting combo at the very least m : not overly powering , not thin , slightly syrupy medium feel d : not over the wall high . this is a once in the while kind of thing . good , but i know i am not knocking these back side note : i forgot who sent this to me . i appreciate it , but sorry i forget who it was !

0.40 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.70	eyed a thick pad of crumpy sediment at the bottom of the bottle . no bottling/best-by date . approached with caution . left at least a good inch of lees in the package . hit with the scent of olive and mocha immediately . no roast , no bitter . not unappealing . warming tipped the balance in favor of mocha . despite what the bottle 's label touted , i did n't get nuff head . in fact , almost none . aggressive enough pour . just lame . super black til you hold to the light to reveal deep purple-red . but it tasted quite good . cocoa ( like they said ) and coffee , but no licorice sorry . barely bitter . moderate malt concentration/body . pinch of that olive in the finish . bordering on watery smooth due to that absence of the bubbles . good enough to drink real quick though . i really like their whale 's tale pale . this was alright too . rather do it on tap on location .

0.80 0.70 0.30 0.40 0.40	australian for beer ! ! appearance-dark golden color , nice white head that dissapears slowly . smell-sort of musky but clear corn touches and a sort of sweet aroma around it all . taste-the dissapointing part , strong flavor initially but turns bland instantly and does n't go down as smoothly as it should . mouthfeel-again the bland flavor hurts it , does n't go down smooth and the aftertaste leaves much to be desired , unforunate . drinkability-those who like a tasteless beer and do n't care as much about flavor will be happy . others will spend their money on a different import i 'm sure . overall- initially this beer showed a lot of promise , i really thought i was in for something much better than i actually got though . overall , pretty dissapointing , it 's a passable beer i guess but there are many better ones to choose from .

1.00 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.70	the beer pours beautiful . great head and retention . the bubbles billow around the beer producing a color like coffee with cream in it . when it settles its a shade lighter than black coffee . the most surprising thing is almost no carbonation is left . if i did n't see the bubbles i would say it 's a still beer . surprisingly lighter tasting than most stouts . this is not a bad beer but there 's nothing really that stands out as unique . it 's good but not great and in my opinion not worth the price . the foreign extra reserve is where it 's at . the most impressive part was the apperance .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.70	holy shit ! pours like a belgium ale , huge white 4 finger head . tons of carbonation rising . pale yellow in color . great head retention and lacing smell is very light . first smell is of white grape juice followed by some straw/grass malts taste is very light , some malt , very little wheat actually . tastes very plain , boring slightly over carbonated mouth feel . very light , on the watery side . highly drinkable but lack of flavors discourages me from wanting to try more than one of these . beer looks amazing but tastes extremely mediocre . not rushing to try another of these soon

0.60 1.00 0.90 0.70 0.90	this one was kinda all over for me . it was orangish red in color with little to no head and some small chunks . smell is exceptional , with a peach and plum smell up front with a bit of malt and hops to follow . taste is a bit above average , nice and complex but reminds me alot of flavored sparkling water . mouthfeel and drinkablity are very good goes down smooth and easy .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40	hard to objective on this one as the extreme sweet nature and character `` gets in the way . '' pours a clear medium dark orange amber with a nice firm and thick white head . nose is full peaches . assertive , fresh , fruity peaches with undertones of belgian candi sugar . mouthfeel is thick , rich and creamy and well balanced ( once you get over the flavor shock ) . flavors - here 's the shock - ultra sweet ; perhaps one of the sweetest of over 3,500 beers i 've tried ; simple sweet , not complex sweet . front palate is all sugar and simple sweet . it goes to a cooked sweet peach , sweet compote , sweet carmel and sweet cooked banana flavor and finishes with sweet toffee and maple syrup . actually well made but just way too sweet to drink .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	pours a translucent medium copper with some awesome bubbling and a thick doughy head . leaves thick spongey lacing . the aroma hash a crisp , almost metallic hop twang in the nose . offers a light to medium citrus nose wit some spiced biscuit and honey malts . the taste starts very faintly sweet , then a blast of blast of faintly metallic hops with some clean lemon zest notes and a resiny palate in the middle and finish of the palate . the finish brings some light honey and toasted white bread .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	pours as a cloudy orangeish color . resembles frankiszer but has some sediment floating around in it - probably just active yeast culture . definitely wonky - has a smell like that of wheat beer but it is n't a wheat beer . has a metallic taste ( due to the local water being used to brew it ) . has kind of a coriander-orange peel aroma with a touch of wheat ( appears and smells like a blue moon but with a lot more color ) . mouthfeel is smooth and full . has a strange aftertaste that almost reminds me of bitterness and sweetness at the same time . drinkability is high when drunk in bisbee but low drunk anywhere else ( it 's just the climate down there ) . it produces a rather full sensation when drunk and can be drunk as a session beer but with the rather variable qualities from bottle to bottle , i 'd have to say unless you can get it from bisbee itself , take a pass on this one .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured from a 12oz bottle with a freshness date . a=exceptional . what an ipa should look like . it poured amber in color with a creamy-brown 3+finger head that lasted quite a while . it left gobs of sticky lacing all over my glass . s=mild floral and citrus hops . i noted some buttery malt aromas as well . t=this is a nice ipa . the hops meet you at the door and walk you all the way through the house . i met some malty ( notes of caramel and buttered biscuits ) characters along the way and was warmley greeted with some spicey alcohol at the back door . there is a mild suggestion of soap on the tongue with this one as well . m=plenty of hoppy bitterness . light to medium bodied . a little thin to the mouth , but the hops compensate . d=this is a very nice ipa . it was a pleasure to drink . this was my first exposure to glbc and they did not disappoint .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.60	comes to a light orange with a head that quickly dissipates . not quite opaque with carbonation coming through . citrus grapefruit smell . a little even sweeter than the traditional grapfruity hops smells . alcohol and spice provide a nice intro to a little sweet honey that mingles well with the grapefruit bitter tastes . it almost seems that the tastes are a pho ipa close to an ipa , but all the flavors are just a little different . a big , full carbonation make for a nice frothy mouthfeel for this complexly flavored beer , but not something that i would drink more than one or two of .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	the brew pours a slightly darker golden color with a huge , creamy , rocky white head that sticks around for a while . the aroma is somewhat weak for an apa . decent hops and a surprising woody aroma dominate . starts off with a strong malt backbone before going to a decent tangy bitterness and then finally hitting some light citrus notes . this brew is obscenely smooth and creamy and very drinkable . yet another winner from concord that definitely got much , much better as it warmed . thanks to the bierman for the sample .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	22oz bottle purchased from bauer wines in boston . pours a light gold with little head and just a bit of bubbles floating to the top . decent lacing on the way down . it has the expected solid hoppy aroma . hey , maybe this beer can be used as a teaching tool so that i will be able to identify simcoe hops in the future ... flavour is piney - i guess there is not much of a flora quality to simcoe hops . a good beer - but does n't significantly stand out from even some regular ipas . and does n't come close to what has become my standard for this category - stone 's ruination .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	served in a devil 's backbone willibecher . back during my boilermaker years , my boyz and i believed that if the wabash ever had a cigarette thrown it , it would explode into an inferno that would make lucifer consider relocating . this has no real importance , but this beer tends to bring that memory bubbling to the surface . ( seriously , do n't swim in the wabash . ) it pours a clear copper topped by a tall bit of thick , light ecru froth , which leaves some decent lacing behind as it subsides . the nose is pretty unspectacular , with notes of caramel , maple syrup , and a light touch of hops ( not citrus , not floral , just hops in general ) . the taste comprises a slight bit o ' citrus , some bitterness , and a solidly bready caramel backbone . the body is a light medium , with light carbonation and a crisp finish . not bad , though i wish the smell were a little better .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	perhaps i 'm just grumpy because the pint cost six dollars and came with a lemon wedge , but i 'm not terribly impressed with the appearance of this beer . with a light , yellowish hay color and smallish frothy head that quickly fades to a foamy film , it looks kind of wimpy for a wheat beer . the scent , however , is nicely balanced . i smell lemon , of course , but it 's not overdone . it also smells fresh , floral , mildy hoppy and somehow chewy ; my expectations are raising . i take a taste and can not maintain my grumpiness . this is yummy stuff . it 's sharp , hoppy , woody , bracing , nutty , and wheaty . the lemony flavor up front is admirably restrained , allowing me to appreciate this beer 's interesting , well-balanced , full-bodied character . the middle is hoppy and woody , and the finish carries a delightful , slightly metallic dryness that sizzles on the back of my tongue and cheeks . a wonderful chewiness pervades all of these stages . the web of foamy stalactites covering the glass at the end is a nice bonus . overall i 'd say that three words describe this beer well : crisp . full . balanced . if i did n't have to schlep to times square and pay through the nose to get this stuff i 'd drink it all the time .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	comes in a 12 oz short neck bottle . well there is no way i can fault the look of this ale..its perfect for style darkest of black with a huge frothy light brown head..beeee-u-tiful . the aroma is mostly of roasted malts , some coffee and its nice . taste is of dark dark unsweetned chocolate , and coffee a slight tangyness near the end and a long burnt bitter aftertaste . very nice and smooth on the tongue..goes down a treat . nice drinkability for a stout though i suspect its quite strong in alcohol .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.60	1 quart jug apperance : pours a `` sprite '' like head with minimal to no retention . the head was lame . the color is brown , but cranberry red up to the light . a very nice coloring on this beer . nose : a tiny bit hopy , with chocolate and alcohol . maybe a tiny finsih of lime . taste : the taste is hopy and a little finish of chocolate . it tastes a lot like it smells . alchohol is a taste i got right in the middle . notes ; very cool jug . awsome marketing for this brew . i 'll be honest with you , the only reason i bought this was because of what it looked like . i was very disapointed for what this brew was supposed to be .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	pours copper with thick tan head that slowly fades to patchy layer , scant patches of lacing . aroma is caramel , roasted dark bread , hints of coffee , quite unexpected , but pleasant combination . taste is quite sweet malt , caramel and bread with light hops and long lasting roasted caramel aftertaste , even with hints of coffee . mouthfeel is full with low carbonation . i am not a big fan of sweet beers , but in this one sweetness was not exaggerated , it was nicely balanced and the roasted character was very interesting as well .

1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80	11.2oz bottle into a st. bernardus wide mouth glass , the only way to go with a de dolle beer imo , these things are tricky to pour . a- a slow pry from the cap resulted in a loud hiss . some foam creeped it 's way up but no beer was wasted , some sediment in the pour though , you really cant get around that , i 've had better luck in the past . the liquid is a honey like bright amber color that 's hard to see through , also golden in appearence . a dense , frothy , rocky mountain foam sat on top forever , excellent lacing . s- the smell on this is bananas . i get alot of sweet candi sweetness initially , but alot of fruit comes forth . apples , pears and pineapples oh my . a good amount of malt giving off more sweetness . some banana and clove mixed with other belgian yeast and spice makes this wonderful . t- very similar to the smell , i think my favorite part of this is the mix of fruits thrown in the mix , banana is very large in taste . other fruity esters . im sure hops were used in this but they dont really show up . good malty sweetness . a slight lemon twinge in the middle . a spicy finish with some cloves mixed with more fruit . i dont pick up any alcohol . i quite like this . m- not the smoothest beer when cold with all the active carbonation , this one is alive . best to let it warm and settle down for a bit . this is quite approachable and while the carb is high and felt the flavor more than makes up for it . as this warms it just gets better and smoother . a nice slightly below medium body with a big aftertaste . d- i splurge on a bottle of this from time to time as a treat and it always impresses me . the drinkability on this is high but i take my time and savor it . crisp and refreshing year round . the alcohol is not noticable at all . i just wish they came in bigger bottles . not intended for aging as de dolle 's website states .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.80	aroma hits with lemon , bread dough , some malt sweetness , and hints of caramel as the 2 '' white head quickly fizzes away to a thin slick with a few large bubbles clinging to the edges . plenty of sticky lace left behind . the beer is a deep gold , dark for a helles . lemony spicy hops ride over a biscuity malt base . the canned vegetal flavor of dms is present but not overwhelming . a bracing bitterness swallows the struggling malt and cleans up the whole mess into a fairly rapid and dry finish . unfortunately , the dms survives into an annoying aftertaste . light body with medium high carbonation makes this easy to toss back , an important quality in a helles , but otherwise this fairly inoffensive lager misses the helles-mark pretty badly . definitely not in spaten territory . if you are looking for an inoffensive quencher at a reasonable price , this is fine . if you want all of the subtle and refreshing qualities of a fine german helles , keep looking .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60	on tap in a 10oz glass at bodega on 6/29/10 dark amber brown ; some cloudiness . poured a thin layer of short-lived foam . ring on retention & one solitary spot of lace . lots of hops in the nose . floral overtones with dense , juicy citrus & some pine . caramel & a touch of brown sugar . smells an awful lot like an imperial red ale . tastes like a cross between an imperial red & a barleywine . malts are more apparent : toasted caramel & brown sugar . maybe a slight hint of toffee , but not much . dense , resiny hops , blending citrus & pine tar . full bodied ; carbonation is moderately low - just enough . gritty , sticky-sweet feel . mild alcohol heat . juicy hops & caramel finish it out . drinkability is ok , i guess . i find it too sweet . somewhat off-kilter for the style , seemingly flying mouflan is n't set on being a barleywine . overall it 's alright , but really weird . i have to dock it for style .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.70 0.60	s- very pleasant aroma . t- extremely piney and citrusy hops flavors with a very mellow , muted malt flavor . highly bitter finish . m- low to medium body with a fair amount of carbonation . d- though i do enjoy this beer , it does n't blow me away in terms of drinkability and does n't even compare to a heavy handed ( to those who are two brothers drinkers ) .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.40 0.30	a : the pour is dark amber/red-brown with a thin tan head forming . s : oh man , this is very medicinal . smells like bandaids , sage , menthol , and anise . it 's also pretty obviously oxidized . the intense herbal and medicinal thing is n't really for me ... t : it does n't improve at all on the palate . cough syrup with plenty of sage and eucalyptus . there 's a bit of a sour apple flavor , which is weird , along with some warming alcohol and cardboard . m : the body is medium with a pretty high carbonation and definite alcohol heat . d : this was all sorts of no good . i would n't even bother with this beer .

1.00 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	poured from my home tap , this one looks great in the glass , with a deep mahogany-amber color and a thick , creamy , foamy , sand-colored head . the aroma is light and fresh albeit usual , with a light citric acidity ( primarily lemon ) being complemented by some bready malts . the light bready sweetness and subtle bitterness again balance each other in the flavor , but there is also an ashy , almost smoky earthiness , which presumably is contributed by the rye . the contribution is n't substantial , however , and only provides some nuance to an otherwise common flavor profile . the carbonation is a bit high initially , but the texture also gets a bit syrupy in the finish , although not terribly so . overall , this is a light and pleasant amber that is plenty drinkable , but only the subtle earthiness from the rye addition sets this apart from any other solid amber ale .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	pours out a wonderful amber/copper/orange color with a thin lacing of head . smell consisted of hops mostly ( really juiced up ) with some citrus notes and other fruity notes . taste was very good . a rush of hops hit the palate along with some caramel for a balancing effect , a bit grassy as well , woody at times , with some citrus juices coming along at the tail end . mouthfeel could of have some more carbonation , but this was from a growler and was damn near perfect almost . truly a one of a kind ipa . big , huge thanks go out to pisskynights for sending me this growler my way !

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	appearance : considerably hazy , very dark golden body with a 1/5-inch-high white head . smell : slightly grainy-hinted pilsner malts with a gentle note of crusty bread . then , in comes a low but unyielding floral , herbal note with a light backing of dried lemon rind . taste : pale , pils german-born maltiness with a scant graininess and bready character to it . very low hint of honey with an equally light sweetness imparted . touch of lemon with some firm leafy aspects as the moderate bitterness arrives . drying , bitterish finish with a last minute pop of lemongrass . mouthfeel : medium-bodied . medium carbonation . overall : it 's certainly not the brightest , clearest looking lager around , but it is tasty .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	great divide espresso oak-aged yeti , cask at the pony bar in hell 's kitchen , ny . appearance : extremely voluptuous head , almost overflowing , with lots of carbonation and bubbles . over one finger of head , with great retention . great temperature too ! ( some casks at pony are at times too cold ) . head and bubbles stay on and on . color is pitch black , no nuances there . smell : incredibly smooth , subdued . i do n't get any coffee , but chocolate instead . a lacking nose . taste : the coffee beans are there , at the end , but thankfully ( or sadly , if you love coffee beers ) they are far from strong . the oak is also mellow , hints of wood come at the end . chocolate at the end of the sip too ( again , as in the nose , more chocolate than coffee ) . some bitterness around the mouth , cooked sugars , even a hint of banana bread . dry finish . mouthfeel : low carbonation of course ( this is a cask after all ) , medium-to-low chocolaty body and medium flavor . oaky finish . drinkability : superb . this is incredibly smooth , chuggable . the 9.5 % can not even be hinted . a little underwhelming ( or a lot ! ) , but tasty nonetheless . my least favorite of all the yetis i 've had so far , though . i expected more .

0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.70	poured from an 11.2 oz . bottle into a pilsner glass . pours a deep caramel brown with yellow-orange highlights and a 1/2 finger off-white head . very little lacing . smell : sweet caramel malt , melons and a touch of dried dark fruit . taste : sweet caramel and a touch of fruity sweetness up front followed by a more subdued malty sweetness in the middle before ending with a mix of toasted malt and a hint of bitterness . aftertaste is dry and somewhat muted . mouthfeel : full-bodied with a fairly high amount of carbonation . goes down smooth . drinkability : good drinkability . i could see myself drinking a couple of these under the right circumstances . overall : good beer overall . not the best dopplebock in the world , but it 's still solid . i 'd say it 's worth a shot .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.80	12oz can obtained via trade with autumnaldave . thanks for the opportunity ... poured into an imperial pint glass , formed a 1/4 '' dark brown ( almost purply black ) head above the opaque black brew . head hangs on , with average lace , which actually is pretty good for the style . aroma is surprisingly minimal , but what is present is the expected dark maltiness with ample hops . taste starts with sweet darkness , but quickly goes almost acrid bitter , in a good way , then giving way to sharp hoppiness , and closing with gradual warmth . mouthfeel smooth and creamy , but the acridness does hamper things a bit , and drinkability reflects the same , but still very good overall . i 'm really being picky here , but that 's just me . regardless , way kudos for oskar blues for continuing to be on the cutting edge on putting new style in the can .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.30	well , i saw the rotten reviews on this but i had to pick it up anyhow ... .i love imperial pilsners ( so far ) and i got ta have my hops..i figure i will love this one ... .so here goes.. pours out pretty darn flat . the only carbonation here is a few rogue bubbles and a `` haze '' as opposed to a head . looks like a premature homebrew really . very cloudy amber , with a few bubbles suspended near the top of the brew.there is a rather skunky hop profile , and not much else except alcohol . the taste of this brew is not too good . there is way too much alcohol for the amount of taste surviving in this brew . some bready malts up front , followed by a burning alcohol sensation with some citrous hop flavors thrown in . thin mouthfeel for the style - i was expecting more stickyness ... drinkability straight sucks . this reminds me of dfh immort ale , only with a nastier alcohol kick . t-bird of craft beers here , and normally i love ipa 's and super hoppy double ipa's/pilsners . no amount of aging will help this brew imo . swing and a miss ! ! ! ! note to newport storm ... go check out dominion - they know this style.i imagine there was a good debate at the brewery as to whether to bottle this or chuck it , because it does not meet quality standards of any respectable brewery .

0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	i know we are supposed to be constructive on this site , but this has to be the worst beer i ever had i my life . this is pretty much sparkling raspberry water with alcohol . there is nothing about this that ever comes close to being a beer , let alone a decent beer . if it was higher in alcohol content that would at least be something , but at 5.0 abv , this is n't doing it . it 's disappointing because i 've had a few other beers by this same brewery , and they 've been pretty good . try again indian wells .

1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90	this beer poured a very dark black color with very little light getting through it . an aroma of malt , hops and coffee . a flavor of malt , hops and coffee . the body of it is lighter than some imperials and the finish has some bitterness to itas i probably have said before , i am a big fan of samuel smith , just suffer sticker shock from the price . when i was over in england and saw it in a local pub for the price of a local pint here , i jumped on it . that being said , i love stouts so my opinion may be biased . the look and taste of this is great ! i rate the imperial over the oatmeal , even though both are excellant .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.50	brown 33cl bottle with an artsy looking label . pours a peach orange-honey -very murky with a big 1inch + cap and holds very well down to 1 finger after a few minutes . very fluffy and fresh-looking lace which leaves thick puffs on glass . the head holds so well it is similar to egg-whites with very soft peaks . smell is a sour honey herb-grass and a little malty too . taste is very complex : bubbly honey-floral grass on the front . finish is slightly spicy and peppery . has a strong alcohol taste too . mouthfeel is warm well-carbonated and smokey . drinkability is below average for this style . i would not buy this again .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.60	beautiful golden bronze colour . head retention is superb , an easy 4 fingers . the downside being the possible loss of half a beer upon opening . these certainly do have a tendency to 'explode ' upon uncapping , with foam exiting the bottle for several minutes afterwards . depending on how settled the yeast is , you 'll more likely than not have a yeast-filled head in your glass . otherwise an average , enjoyable ea with a unique citrus-zest je ne sais quoi .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.70	very light copper color mixed with soft tarnushed brass . good bubbling , great head and foam retention for all 16 ozs . old grass clippings , soft , sweet biscuits , toasted malts . then theres some metallic and semingly adjuncty aromas . toasted and super grassy upfront . the middle gets metallic and musty , with soft toasty undertones . the finish is a creamy , frothy , faint metallic grass and wonderbread .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	[ eyes ] clear pale yellow color with a very foamy white head with no retention ... fuuullll of carbornation a lot of bubbles inside.. [ nouse ] the aroma is poor a little malty with little notes of flowers in deeep . [ mouth ] is fresh , the body is medium / smooth with a mild hop bitterness ... a little bitter aftertaste.. this beer is ideal for a sunnyyyy dayyy

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80 0.80	up next we have the curious and weirdly artworked `` dantalion '' from good ole upland . this beer was proudly `` summoned '' on 2.4.2010 and delivered to me by my friend and world-renown traveler , unclejedi . 750ml bottle , corked / caged opens with a snap , and goes into our glasses . a . clear russet , low 2cm head with no real lacing . looks like a good flanders red . mostly still . nice looking . good retention . s. excellent . cherry vinegar , sweet malt notes , tart and bold with a little oak in the bargain . quite sharp , acidic and bright , but not overly so , and maintains a sweetness to the nose that is delicious . t. surprisingly sweet , still , but the sweetness here collides rather messily with a too-acidic sharpness that could be toned down a few notches . vinegary and appealing for what it is - think an american rodenbach grand cru - but the burning in my throat after a long sip tells me there is more work to be done here . in turns sweet , cherry-fruit , vinegar and sour , the rest is quite tasty . it just lacks that magic that one can achieve when making the same beer for a few decades . m / o . excellent carbonation , full without being distracting and appropriate for what this is . thinner body , as expected , but a long fruity-sweet vinegar lingers , though regrettably the acidic burn makes its way into your throat . otherwise , dantalion is highly enjoyable . i 'd be curious to know if this will change much going forward , alas , it was my only bottle . was glad to have tried this - thanks to my friends for making it happen .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	thnx to arenbeer for a glass of this . poured from a bomber bottle into a pint glass . poured a lightly cloudy honey color with a good 2 finger frothy head riddled with bubbles and lacing down the glass . light citrus and hop nose with some caramel , the smell of this brew had me snorting beer , it waz awesome and i couldnt quite put my nostril on some of the aromas , but i liked them . tasted hops , malt , very balanced and lightly fruity . the mouthfeel waz light-medium and slightly warming . this had me drinking quickly and wanting more . overall i waz pleased and i am glad to have tried this limited edition brew , i could drink this all day .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.80	no idea what the age on this one is . unintentionally cellared it for around 6 months . no visible date on the bottle . first pour is nice . thick , velvety black , fairly large creamy tan , decent lacing . second pour is ... .disturbing . thick chunks plop into the glass . left about 1/10 of the beer in the bomber , still visible chunks , not really able to tell what they are . knocks a 4.5 down to 3.0 average aroma of rich quality coffee is more powerful than the stoutness , maybe some hint of alcohol . almost a slightly interesting tart note to it . flavor is bold and complex . lots of layers and almost tastes spiced at some points . mouthfeel is very full , good match to the style and bold flavors . smooth , no alcohol feel . overall this is a great imperial stout , marred by the gunk plopping out of the bottle .

1.00 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.70	a - pours a dark , murky brown with ruby highlights . thick , rocky , four finger khaki head . chunky lacing left all over . s - dark fruits on the nose , with fig , plum and raisin . a but of spice and earth from the yeast . a dash of leather . t - major plum & fig notes , balanced by yeasty spices and earth notes . alcohol burn is a bit sharp at the beginning , but this mellows somewhat as the beer warms . m - medium bodied , with bright carbonation . dry finish . dude , this is a smooth beer ! d - the alcohol presence brings the score down , but i could still enjoy a few glasses of this . the bomber was a pleasure from top to bottom . a quintessential belgian abbey ale , and a personal favorite .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.70	carefully poured from a long-standing bottle its a perfectly clear and beautiful pinkish-orange . add the yeast and it becomes hazy . but anyway that you pour it , the bright white head dissipates almost immediately to just a very thin collar which leaves no lace . the nose is tart but clean with a non-specific fruit character that 's like a blush wine or champagne . the body is light-medium and its very fine , natural , and moderate carbonation leaves it lightly crisp in the mouth . a bit of astringency is also reminiscent of wine . the flavor is tart and delicately fruity ( apples , white grapes ) . there 's no real bitterness to speak of , yet it 's tart astringency leaves it quite dry in the finish . an interesting beer that 's on it 's way to becoming a lambic , but does n't have any of the funkiness that really gives them character .

0.40 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.70	22oz bottle with ibus , original gravity , and abv but no date . wtf . a - poured a clear dark amber color with a small tan had that has very little retention . why is this stout see through ? s - high level of roasted malts with a surprisingly low level of coffee and cocoa for what the name of this beer is . no hop aroma of any kind . t - strong maltiness and a slight bitter hop flavor with a dry , bitter coffee finish . for a coffee stout , this is very light . m - medium body at best that 's far too light for its style . has a crisp , sharp bite to it much more so than the smooth , full-bodied mouthfeel you would find in a typical imperial stout . d - it 's an easy drinker which is attributed to its much lighter body for a stout , however , it should n't be this way . this beer was a disappointment . it seemed like it was constantly off on the style requirements of a stout of this style . it could do very well to up the mouthfeel to full-bodied with a creamy smoothness while also darkening the color . this could help the flavor too . more roasted malts and coffee if that 's what the name is going to be . close , but no cigar .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	served at ned kelly 's pub , kinsale , ireland . a- poured into a glass with a thick 3/4 '' foamy white head , which quickly dissipated , leaving no lacing behind . the body was a crystal clear yellow color with heavy visible carbonation . s- the nose features some crackerlike pilsener malt and a huge aroma of noble hops . hops are dominating this nose and are herbal and low-alpha in nature . a nice clean and zesty nose . t- on the palate it 's a very nice replicate ; very crisp and clean , with some hop bitterness and some mild flavors of cooked corn . the cooked corn is a *slight* turn-off , but it still tastes good overall . m- thin , heavily carbonated ... ca n't tell if there 's some slight astringency here , or if i 'm just dehydrated ... d- very drinkable ... much moreso than the budweiser we get here in the states !

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.50	12oz bottle into portsmouth snifter . a : pours a very dark brown with a billowing fluffy dark tan-ish brown oily head that slowly faded into a thick film leaving a network of sticky lace . s : i do n't know why i 'm surprised , but i can actually smell the juniper ( although it 's not very strong ) . it 's hoppy as well with notes of pine , but there is also a darker , maltier , burnt character . t : pretty big hop punch on the palate at first followed by more roasted and coffee-like flavors . a decent , well rounded black ipa if i 've ever had one , but the juniper does n't stand out . finish is fairly bitter with a hint of coffee . m : high carbonation that is prickly at times , medium-thin body and a slightly astringent mouthfeel . this aspect could use some work . o : sn are pros and definitely one of my favorite/go-to breweries . however this one just does n't really do it for me . i can see what they were going for in this , but to me it 's just not that exciting or drinkable .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	dusky-hued dark ruby , with a rim of white . strong all cassis aroma . first , freshly poured percolating hero cassis , bubbling in a nonic at a bar in amsterdam , followed by tooth-marring finnish cassis jellies , and finally with a tart nip of lightly aged belgian black currant juice . all expressive , yet singular . incredibly profusive . bright , however yielded a faint edge of vegetal character . flavor begins with a sharp , sweet and almost slightly bitter cassis flavor , with edges of blackberry and tight vinegar expressions . after a blossing bold cassis domination initial , im swepth into a faint dark caramelly sugar , with some distant yeast toasts . this movement of other characters doesnt really ever get to fully express itself , drowned in the sea of amazing black currant character . again , this ebbs mediciney and cloying , with a few touches of sickly sugar . however , one can not underestimate the ridiculous smoothness for a beer of assumedly 17 % alcohol . vinous and caramel shuffled with cassis in some first date awkwardness . finally , a touching note of minute vegetal hop dust sails over the blasting fruit character . yeast spice and esters i think help add an extra dimension to the cassis flavor . obviously this was accidental ( the addition of currant juice ) , because its unbalanced . if the currants had been reduced by 50 % this would be a beer up there with raspberry eisbock . being the cassis whore that i am , this was fun to sip , especially considering the bright vinous notes , but it just got a little overbearing . i guess not every accident spawns a winner .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	bright transparent golden hue with a two inch frothy white head . lots of bubbles and good lacing . quite lively without being out of control . perfect appearance . weaker aroma with some corn syrup notes and a low , biting spicy acidity . still , a bit too soft and sweet for my liking . flavors are abundant in this pils . a really sweet start with honey and sweet fruity flavors , mainly apple , on top . a bready sweet base and some pils malt lie under . hops come in midway through and really dry the sweetness out . malty base remains but the herbal , spicy quality of the hops provides a bitter flavor that is quite refreshing . finish is drying and slightly spicy . moderate mouthfeel and lively . the flavors all come out , sometimes too much . not the greatest blending of ingredients and i might like a bit more complexity from the hops and malts but overall the beer went down nicely . fairly drinkable but the sweetness and then bitterness would be too much for me to want to session over a long period of time . it was still refreshing and flavorful . i would definitely get this again .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.80	yum ! 375ml bottle , batch 10 , poured into my duvel tulip . a - very dark murky brown pour , extremely large ( 4-finger ) head . head retention is ridiculous on this one - in a good way - sticks around forever . lots of lacing . really beautiful . more than halfway through the brew , there 's still a complete cover over the top . s - sweet . very fruity - cherries , currants , banana , raisins . a little spice too . t - fruity , but not as fruity as it smelled ( which is not bad by any means ) . smooth roasted malts , belgian-style yeast taste . a little spice at the end ... just the right little hop bite to give it a little extra but not to overpower the malts . finish is actually dryer than i would have expected . m - carbonation is fine . it 's pretty smooth , but it 's a little more drying than i 'd like . d - very , for the style . it could be a little less drying , but overall not a lot of complaints about this offering from rr .

0.30 0.50 0.70 0.50 0.80	hefeweizen ? no . decent beer ? yes . pours a dark cloudy cider with a short lived frothy white head . no lace and no retention makes this a boring and bland appearance . fruity malt aroma with soft grains and a hint of brown sugar . full bodied , rounded fruit flavours are followed by a short of caramel and a burst of refreshing wheat crispness in the finish . its certainly thirst quenching and the light body assists in this , but in no way , shape , or form , can this be described as a hefeweizen , and i 've marked it as such . it seems that pyramid still have a lot to learn . thanks to mark for the bottle .

0.30 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.50	poured a murky brown , with a large number of specks floating around in it . no head at all , and no lacing at all either . it reminded me of stagnant pond water . not a good looking beer at all . smelled of a mixture of hops and grains . nothing really stood out , but it was balanced . tasted again , like hops and grains , and again , nothing really stood out . i struggled to put a finger on any real identifying taste and could n't . i did however , get a bit of that soapy taste which another reviewer mentioned . mouthfeel was very thin and flat . i prefer more body , especially in a beer of this style . it felt `` dead '' in the mouth . i love to support the local brewers whenever possible , but i have to be honest here and say this is not a beer i 'd consider purchasing again unless changes are made . perhaps because they are a new brewery they are still working out the kinks and will improve . i 'll give this beer another try somewhere in the future , if single bottles are available , and hopefully it will be better then .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured chilled in tall pilsner glass a : little carbonation ; minimal head ; clear , solid yellow s : clove , yeast ; inviting aroma t : dry , spiced , medium hops ; light on the belgian side of things ( e.g. , bottle conditioning ) ; not very intense flavor overall , a good solid beer , drawing sound inspiration from the belgians .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.70	had this one on tap a couple of nights ago . poured to a deep dark black color , with no head what so ever . must say from the way it looked i was questioning what i had gotten ! the aromas where quite nice with a rich chocolate flavor with a fruit like tinge to it along a burnt/toasted smell . the taste was dominated by a burn malt flavor with some sweetness that seems to go well together . over all this brew was not bad , not a favorite by any stretch but one i would try again .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60	served this american porter on tap , in a pint glass at the brewery . this porter poured motor oil black , produced a thick tan head , excellent head retention , and excellent lacing . the aroma of this porter had a backbone of roasted malt , chocolate , caramel and just a faint trace of vanilla . the taste of this brew is medium in body , malt base with chocolate , and some vanilla flavor . slightly sweet throughout , as i prefer six row 's strong porter ... this variation is not a bad session beer to try once . however i wo n't seek this one out in the future .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	genuinely unimpressed . i was looking forward to this beer all day after hearing a podcast on the subject on kolsch beer recently , and this didnt deliver the goods . to be fair , i think this particular sample might be a bit on the old side . aroma is malty but unremarkable . kolsch is not a pilsner ( bottom fermenting ) , but looks like a pilsner urquell going into the glass . sadly , the taste in the first sip made me wishing for a pilsner urquell ! taste is malty but flat . i would try again if i were cologne ... until then , id need some kind of inducement to get me to give it another try . 500ml bottle .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	pours from 12oz bottle . had during the dark horse tasting . a- pours a jet black color . no real head comes about from the pour . oily slickness on the sides of the glass but no lacing at all . s- roasted malts with some light coffee notes in the front of this . the blueberry part comes into play in the undertones and with such full aroma . the artifical smell is not there and this smell like it is made with real blueberries . t- taste at first was of light roasted malts and some coffee notes . the blueberry flavor somes into play in the middle of the beer with light roastedness coming back into play on the ending of it . m- medium heavy mouthfeel . carbonation is a little light for the style . light roasted malts left on the palate while the aftertaste is more blueberry forward . oily slickness left all over the palate . d- very drinkable stout that fuses roastedness and fruit as well . dark horse just seems to not do wrong with anything they do .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	a : the initial pour into my weizen glass was almost 100 % foam , so i switched over to nonic . when the head settled , i had a nice lemon-glow hazy weizenbock . s : holy lemony amarillo , batman ! the normal aroma from a weizenbock has the citrus kicked up at least two notches by the hops . the clove and ethanol scents are largely subsumed , though . t : i had always suspected that amarillo would be the perfect hop for a weizen , but i 'm not entirely certain anymore . do n't get me wrong : this is one fantastic beer , but i think i slightly prefer the schneider version of the collaboration . if you do n't like the clovey side , this one 's for you , though . m : great body with ( as mentioned ) ample carbonation , even above and beyond that of a normal weizen . the abv is very well hidden , much more so than the usual weizenbock . d : this went down so well that i was shocked to be faced with an empty glass .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.80 0.90	a- hazy , golden body . nice white , foamy head with great retention . leaves a nice lacing . s- very yeasty with some clove and a slight note of citrus . t- a good bit of clove here . only a touch of bubblegum followed by a slight citrus . taste is pretty dry from start to finish . m- medium body with moderate carbonation . cuts out pretty quickly . d- very drinkable for a weissbier . goes down easy and does n't overpower your palate . overall , this is definitely not my favorite weissbier , but it certainly is n't bad .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 1.00	this is a monkey that i do n't mind having on my back at all ! a nicely refreshing brew with a well rounded malt backbone an a subtle yet firm hops punch . glad i was able to find this one and hope i 'm able to get some more ( bought the last two 6 packs ! ) looks very dingy but in a good way lots of stuff happening in the smell dept . lots of grains taste is beautiful well balanced feel somewhat crisp on the tounge-cool ! goes down super easy atruly nice beer !

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	unfortunately , i ca n't read the date on the bottle so i 'm not sure of the freshness of this one . it 's been in the fridge for a couple weeks so it may be a bit old . enjoyed on 03/06/11 . a - hazy , pale straw yellow color with less than a one finger white head . leaves little to no lacing . color is right on for a pilsener but the head/lacing is disappointing . s - smell is very good . light bready malts , crisp citrus hops and some peppery spiciness . make sure to have plenty of these laying around for some hot summer days . t - very similar to the nose . nice citrus and spicy finish . incredibly easy to drink . good example of the style . m/d - mouthfeel is good , medium bodied , just creamy enough . drinkability is high because of the good crisp finish .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.60	12 ounce bottle poured into a duvel tulip . see-thru burnt orange body with a huge frothy head . excellent retention and plentiful lacing . nose is somewhat akin to a fresh fruit salad : orange , pineapple , something sweeter like pears in there . tastes somewhat more aggressive with a grassy bitterness and a healthy squeeze of grapefruit juice . very light malt sweetness and a crisp clean finish . medium body , moderate carbonation . overall impression : the appearance rating definitely inflates the score a bit , but a solid ipa nonetheless .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic . pours a clear golden color with a sizeable head that leaves nice lacing down the glass . the aroma is pretty bad . sweet grainy malts , adjuncts , a touch of hops , and a bit of wheat . the taste is a bit better . it goes down a bit better than the nose suggests , but still not great . smooth wheat at first . a bit more wheat and a touch of hops at the end . i mean , it 's alright , but nothing special . the mouthfeel is crisp and smooth , but wholly unremarkable , and the drinkability is quite good . after shiner 's 101 , which i thought was a pretty solid pilsner , i was hoping the next entry in the anniversary series would be a bit better . but it 's not , this is just an average wheat ale . nothing `` double '' about it at all .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	on tap at memphis tap room on 3/7/09 during philly beer week . a - poured a caramely copper-colored body with modest carbonation and very little head that quickly disappeared and left no lacing . s - very subdued nose for a bourbon barrel-aged beer , especially a barleywine . sweet caramel malt with borubon and vanilla notes emerging as it warmed up . some bubblegum notes reminiscent of hubba bubba also appeared , along with a slight waft of alcohol . t - the sweetness of the malt and vanilla flavor creates an underlying bublegum sweetness . hops are surprisingly scant , as is the bourbon presence . there are some oak/woody notes with a touch of vanilla that emerge in the finish . m - medium body with a thick , syrupy mouthfeel . while it is certainly sweet , the bourbon presence appeases any cloying aspect this would have had . finish is bittersweet . d - this was n't as insane as i had anticipated . instead , this was a very sweet barleywine with a subtle bourbon presence . i will say that it was quite drinkable for a high abv barleywine , although one was certainly enough for me in a sitting .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	if you like raspberries , you will like this beer . both the smell and taste are strongly raspberry , but fortunately the raspberry flavor does not overwhelm the palate . it was hard to judge appearance since it was in a brown bottle , but it seems to be a little cloudy with just a bit of foam . flavor is smooth , jazzy , and wheaty with a strong raspberry overtone .

0.40 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50	originally reviewed april 9 , 2005 . on tap at the gitchee gumee brewfest 2005 . the aroma made me think of being in a spice store with all the various blend of musky spices , but it was all downhill from there . the color was light golden and boring . the flavor tasted like bandaids and medicine , although i 'm downright certain it was not infected , but nonetheless was obviously unpleasent . no depth and a very watery finish .

0.40 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.60	2001 vintage . brewed with northwest 2-row , brown , dark caramel , and chocolate malts . hopped with centennial and cascade . 8.1 % abv . pours out to a murky , sediment-rich , clogged drain looking dark amber , forming a small dark beige with no retention or lacing , despite a chugging pour . looks like the last bottle of homebrew from a primary . carbonation is moderate to mild . aroma is rich with dates , figs , golden raisins , milk chocolate syrup , and some mild resinous hops . mouthfeel is smooth and soft , with a medium-dense body , and semi-dry earthy finish . taste begins with some initial malt sweetness and amber malt body , followed by mild resinous hops which escalate into a medium-strong herbal bitterness and pronounced earthiness in the finish ... lots of astringent earth and wood with a semi-dry finish and touches of peppery alcohol , tobacco , darjeeling , ethopian harrar , and cedar . cleanly fermented with no off-flavors . a little light in the malt sugar department , this one has fermented dry , and would benefit from more complex sugars . probably better young . decent , but not very impressive for the style .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	excellent beer . the nose and flavor profile were really clean . it could be a little more ester-y ( i.e. , more belgian ) but i think most people will really appreciate how crisp it is . on a related note , the body made the beer quite drinkable . it bordered on quaffable , which is meant as a compliment - the higher abv is almost completely hidden - although i would have preferred to see it with a little more mouth-feel , perhaps by way of a slightly higher mash temp . i agree that the roast could be cut a little , although not much . the roasted character was more noticeable when it was cold and seemed more in balance toward the end of my glass . still , cutting it a little would probably be a good idea . i think the bittering hops were in balance , but i think more aroma and dry hops would be a good thing particularly given the style . the appearance of the beer was beautiful - the color was a rich black , there was nice head retention and some lacing . overall , this was a terrific and memorable beer .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.30	pours a mahogany with a thin beige head . nose has sour cherries , plums , oak , tart yeast and a subtle funky presence . taste is very sour and acidic . hard to drink . also has some oak and fruity undertones . medium body is lightly carbonated with a very acidic finish . could use a bit of time to mellow out .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80 0.70	disclaimer : beer aged 1 year - 2010 vintage drunk in 2011 . poured into a founders tumbler the beer looks beautiful . hazy brownish orange body with a beautiful bubbly head that recedes to a sticky big bubble film that does not go away . i just love this . the smell is outrageous : sweet , candy , tropical , fruity pebbles , too much . tastes sweet sweet can- ( gummy venus de milo , anyone ? ) dy . strong booze smack . a big big sipper spent close to an hour on this before i had to run and down the last half of it . very syrup-y , i want to say under-attenuated , could have used a bit more thinning in the body , but i do n't know much about attenuation . just go with `` it 's very syrupy . '' overall , i 'd say i wish i can taste it fresh . take this review for what it 's worth when you have a fresh bottle or glass sitting in front of you for ... this is a review of a 2010-1year vintage .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.70	beer is a dark , dark color , with just the slightest hints of ruby at the edges and a coffee colored head . beautiful to look at , and almost as nice to drink . the smell is coffee , cocoa , and just a hint of caramel or toffee , with an underlying alcohol character ( and honey sweetness ) . taste is very similar to the smell , with the coffee and cocoa taking center stage and the alcohol almost overpowering the toffee and caramel notes . luckily , the sweetness helps to balance that out . mouthfeel is good , nice and thick , with just a hint of stickiness . the drinkability is n't the best , i was actually surprised that this did n't have the highest abv of the beers i had at dragonmead . that being said , it was a perfectly enjoyable beer , and i 'd jump at the chance to have another .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.80	22 oz . bottle tried 30 jan 2010 . # 159/224 . trade from mutterfudder , thanks ! served in a 0.4 l steiner pils snifter . small rapidly disappearing head . medium carbonation . cloudy brown color . yeasty , appley , brown sugar and cherry aroma . apple and yeasty to start , with vanilla , bourbon and cherry tartness . also some raisins and oakiness . boozy warm finish . medium body . after an initial burst of carbonation beer becomes pretty flat . apperance is meh but otherwise a nice beer .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	same good looks as the others . bronze topped with a healthy dollop of buttercreme . the baseline caramel and bready maltiness shows through more on the nose , with the ahtanum adding backing notes of orange peel and pepper . the aroma suffers from a lack of assertion and definition . playing off the malt template , the ahtanums fare slightly better in the mouth , bringing a pronounced florality , orange peel , pepper , and mint hues , particularly in the finish . bitterness is low to moderate . while mildly interesting as a laboratory on ahtanum , it 's clear that this hop wo n't headline any solo tours .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.70	pours a dull yellow with a very small head , which will disappear relatively quickly . i really couldnt pick up much of a smell ... . so i really cant describe it . the taste was clean and clear with a hop finish . mouthfeel was also smooth and lightly carbonated . this beer wasnt super flavorful but is decent and goes down good . out door thirst quenching beer .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.70	poured this out of a pint sized clear glass bottle into a large mug . poured nicely headed up slowly and then the head almost disappeared with just a ring around the edge of the mug . nice and dark like a good iced tea and it leaves a nice thin lacing . hops up front that taste like metal and grass ( the lawn kind ... ) and then malt followed by more bitter grass , a little skunky but i lke it . it almost reminds me of a fosters with malt . its a little flat but that could be on acount of a rough pour . i will pick this up again and give her a gentle pour .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	12oz . bottle served into a globe glass . thanks for the beer , bo ! pours a rusty nail/muddy water sort of brown color . i was expecting , you know , some darkness . this beer looks about as dark as some of the darker amber ales . the off-white head does n't approach more than a finger , not even close . lacing is unspectacular . even without taking off for the weird color , this is an unimpressive looking dry stout . this is a pretty average stout on the nose . sure , you get some light roasted malt . some cocoa powder . that 's about it , though . i detect some salty component ; that is assuredly coming from the oysters . it 's a pretty tight , closed nose without a lot to offer , but what is there is on-point . thankfully , porterhouse 's oyster stout completely delivers on the palate . cocoa puffs brand cereal meets a significant black licorice characteristic . a gentle roast flavor transitions into a decided salinity from the oysters . that salty note finishes quite earthy ; it 's here where the hops meld with the brine flavor in a pretty wonderful way . this beer feels more or less right for the style in terms of mouthfeel . it is n't heavy , but it has a certain gloop to it that sets it apart from other dry stouts . the drinkability is quite nice , mostly because of how well the flavors transition into one another . the licorice flavor is informed by the salty brine which plays well with the earthy hops on the finish . if you 've never had the classic pairing of stout + oysters , then go eat that . if you ca n't , then your next best option is to find an oyster stout . this would be a good choice .

0.70 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.80	poured from a 750 ml bottle to a tulip . batch # 003x1 . what does one do when he shows up to a bar looking for a quick $ 5 pint and stumbles upon a big , pricey bottle of consecration ? ( that was a rhetorical question . ) a : the body is dark , murky & pruney-brown colored with a small bubbly head , light brown in color . it made an appearance and then , all at once , took off like it stole something . interesting to say the least but i 'm not at all impressed at this point . s : thank goodness ... nothing short of phenomenal ! first and dominant aroma is the yeast bill which is heavy barnyard , sweat and meat . the bottle boasts of the brettanomyces , lactobacillus , saccharomyces & pediococcus , all wild yeast strains as far as i know . and why not ? they combine to assist in one of the most uniquely aromatic brews i 've ever tried . the malt and hops are hard to separate but i get hay/straw and flower respectively . an entire orchestra of fruit flavors : dark and ripe fruits of raisin , plum , red grape , currant & date provide the sweet flavors while the white grape & raspberry supplement with sour and tart . a bit of prune and dried fig come to mind as well . no mistaking the vinous nature of consecration either . the oaky wood and earthy cabernet sauvignon components ( plus hints of tobacco ) are deep rooted . t & m : the flavor duration is tantalizingly long and slow , making it impossible not to savor each sip . moderately sweet and harshly acidic ( but in a stimulating way ) . the mouthfeel is somewhere on another planet . the carbonation level is atmospheric . the finish is wildly astringent . the body is fuller than a woman in a 'plus-size ' department store . i love it ! ! ! d : if i can drink an entire 750 by myself , you can too .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	this was my very first hefe . before i drank it , i thought that all wheat beers were the same , and that this was some spicy anomaly in a world where bland unfiltered wheats were the norm . as such , i gave it a good score , and even went so far as to call it a `` unqiue '' hefe ( that comment has since been deleted ) . since it was my first taste of this grand style , i wondered what i would think if i revisited it after a few years worth of pallette growth . pours cloudy gold with almost no head . the color is decent , but when compared to the billowing , fluffy heads of grand hefes , it 's not really that great . smells lightly like white pepper and banana . not much complexity , not very strong , but pretty good . tastes a kick better than the nose . dull banana and white pepper still dominate throughout , but the wheatmalt is smooth and layered -- it comes at you like a wave of different mellow flavors . tasty . all in all , a solid example of this style . this was one of the first craft beers i really enjoyed and , thanks to the ralph steadman-fueled high sales of flying dog , it 's probably been the first hefes of a helluva lot of people . not a bad crossover beer in the least .

0.50 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	750 ml bottle from the 2011 batch , allowed to warm slightly before being poured into my duvel tulip . peconic county reserve pours a slightly hazy tangerine at first , but after the second pour it 's almost entirely opaque . the pure white head only rises to only about two fingers in height , and while retention is alright , there 's no real lacing to speak of . the nose is strongly of chardonnay , with a strong background note of earthy brett funk in there as well . it 's a combination that works incredibly well . at first the chardonnay does n't come through so well , it 's more of a vinous acidity that blends with the funk . as the beer warms though , the particulars of the chardonnay grape varietal shine through a bit more . there 's still tartness to the beer , but it 's a bit more of a complementary flavor . the body is just a tad heavy for my personal taste , but certainly well within the parameters for the style . the carbonation though is a bit dull , and lets the mouthfeel get a little too slick for the beer 's own good . this beer may have been in some part a victim of high expectations ( brewed with grapes and barrel aged from the guy who wrote the book on saisons ) , but i 'd like to think that did n't diminish my enjoyment of what was a good ( but not great ) brew .

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.40 0.60	futuristic-looking 22oz aluminum can ( which turns out to be very hard to crush ) . there 's some code stamped on the bottom , but i can not decode it . pours a very clear budweiser gold , with a fluffy white head . in a big glass mug it actually looks refreshing . i ca n't say there 's any aroma to speak of , as hard as i sniff . not much there tastewise either , except for some bitterness at the end . any pale malts that the brewery uses are not very assertive in the palate . though , overall , it 's fairly dry and crisp . the can looks pretty cool . the beer is not as impressive .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90 0.80	into a tulip , pours a decent head initially , with little lacing and no legs . the body exhibits a reddish orange color out of the light and a more yellowish orange in the light . strong aromas of candy , hops , and malts . very complex . even gives off a little graham cracker scent . flavors are sweet , and similar to the aromas complex , but as alexd3891 ( who i am drinking this with while watching ufc ) says , `` it needs to come together more . '' for those with a palate of stone ( no pun intended ) , you will get the flavors you need but the heat at the finish may disappoint slightly . mouthfeel is hot , slightly chewy , and exhibits a little bit of carbonation . overall , i agree with alexd3891 that this could use a little more aging to bring what is potentially a phenomenal barleywine into its peak . that said , it 's about as enjoyable as a 2007 as a bigfoot barleywine by sierra nevada is in 2009 . if you enjoy that at that year , you should enjoy this .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.70	a - pretty , near black pour with quite a sold 1+ inch head that stays around for awhile . sudsy thick cling lace . s - toasted malt , cocoa and a little coffee . t - bitter version of smell . not much sweetness in this one . m - balance off for me . good carb , maybe too much carb , washes out the feel . somewhat creamy in the finish . d - big abv and coating palate killing flavors .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.40 0.40	appearance - wine cooler pink with a slight haze . beer really should n't be pink , in my opinion - it just feels wrong . head retention is very solid , so i 'll give it a nod for that . smell - sweetened cranberry juice and minerals . faintly musty . taste - extremely metallic . sweet and tart cranberry with slight breadiness . the mineral/metallic flavors really take over in the finish , and it 's not pleasant . mouthfeel - light bodied , a touch watery perhaps , with crisp carbonation . just about the only saving grace of this beer . notes - what the hell is sam adams thinking with this beer , and why do they keep making it ? it 's truly terrible stuff .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	appearance : light-brown to copper , slight haze , good layer of off-white spongey foam , ok head retention aroma : seductive passion-fruity/citrusy hops folded through a toasty malt caramel flavor : medium malt sweetness balanced by a smooth bitterness that 's not too overpowering ; slightly burnt caramel and toffee ; finishes semisweet with a lingering citrus-peel bitterness mouthfeel : medium body , gentle carbonation , crisp but soft , slight alcohol warmth other comments : this is a tasty multi-purpose pale ale and it really does bring to mind volcanoes because of the caramelized sweetness . maybe what happens when wort meets molten lava ? that 's not to say that this beer smells or tastes like sulphur , though !

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.40	had on tap at willimantic cafe in ct. a - pours copper colored with a white foam on top . very clear and minimal carbonation . s - smells like antiseptic . reminds me of a hospital , or being down the hba aisle in cvs . t - taste has qualities of lemon , but the sourness of brett yeast kills this one . really ca n't finish it . m - sour finish that makes what should be a refeshing beer come off astringent and have a residual taste of mouthwash at the end . not exactly pleasant . o - very glad the waiter warend me and offered an 8oz sample that once i did n't like allowed me to try another beer . i love brooklyn but this was an experiment gone wrong .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.50	what 's the difference between a strong belgian dark ale and a dutch barleywine ? apparently nothing as the terminology is interchangeable with the brewery . orange and dark red hue to the beer , good haze , ample head , great retention and lacing . aroma was bland , so was the taste kind of . the complexities of the yeast and plum i would guess were somewhat interesting . i was surprised what the beer lacked . . . hops , malt , etc . . . i mean , whatever style they are calling it , it should have some heft , some body , but this was a thin feel . how the alcohol did n't show more , i do n't know . this was just unfamiliar territory that i doubt i 'll be back in anytime soon .

0.30 0.20 0.40 0.30 0.90	drank this straight from the can on a camping trip . ahh miller light . we have a love-hate relationship do n't we ? this is pretty much all i drank in high school and college , and believe it or not we actually considered this `` good '' beer ( compared to keystones or `` the beast '' ) . i actually do n't know what this beer looks like in a glass since i 've always had it straight from the can ... .or bottle if i had a little extra cash and really felt like living it up . the only time i 've ever actually seen what this beer looks like is when it 's foamed into a plastic cup at a kegger , or when i 've yacked it back up ( gim me a break ... we were all young and stupid once ) . from a can , the scent smells like a bowling alley and tastes like sucking on a penny . this is much better from a bottle . tastes like adjuncts..mainly corn and aluminum . the major redeeming quality of this beer is that it 's almost complete lack of scent or taste makes it go down easier than almost anything i 've ever had . after a hot day outside , i could pretty much down one of these in one go . chug chug chug ... .ahhh . there is really nothing to be enjoyed about this beer other than the thirst quenching sting in the throat from all of the carbonation . drink this ice cold and as quickly as possible ... .it really is very refreshing .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	( poured in a nonic ) a- the jet black inky body had a few swirling tan bubbles as the head no matter how rigorous the pour . there was a gentle carbonation of bubbles popping at the surface . s- this beer has a dark rich roasted black malt aroma with a pleasant farm animal hint but otherwise pretty clean . t- the inky roasted black malt flavor is a bit more dry than sweet and has a faint barnyard and raw roasted grain note to it . there is a slightly sweet maduro tobacco note that is then followed by a light roasted inky bitterness in the finish . m- this beer has a slippery mouthfeel that is medium and no alcohol heat . d- this beer is a nice full stout with some unique farm notes that are soft but very complimentary to the grain bill . a little more aroma and head would really make this a great beer . it already is delicious .

0.60 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	this brew pours a nearly opaque ruby black color with a small amount of medium khaki head . the smell is n't too strong , with lots of sweetness as well as a bit of toasty malt smell . smell not too strong glug glug glug the flavor is big on the lactose . creamy sweetness thy almost reminds me of ice cream . there is enough sweet and surly malt to balance the whole thing very nicely . mouthfeel is fantastically smoky and creamy . drinkable as well ... does n't feel too heavy or boozy . a dessert stout if you will .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.60 0.60	bright dark orange colored beer with a large frothy , long lasting head that could only come from belgium . nose shows traces of fruity hops ( peach , nectarine . ) it 's a sweet , sugary beer with a slightly diminished , but bold hop presence . notes of peach , with a touch of lemon . out of balance and a bit to sweet for me .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70	birthday present from wife . $ 3.29/bottle . pours fizzy chocolate brown with a dense coffee & cream colored head . very foamy . great look to this beer . smell is clean belgian - fruity with a good hop presence . taste is fruity , wood , some dirt , coffee , almonds , alcohol . there 's a subtle smokiness that 's a bit of a distraction . this might be better cold . mouthfeel is a bit hot from the alcohol and just a touch fizzy . maybe a bad or old bottle ? i know i had this on draft when i was in italy and i loved it .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.60	notes from 08/15/2010 : 12 oz bottle at 42 degrees into a pint glass . a : it pours a transluscent orangey-coppery-bronze color with some quickly dissipating fizziness . s : mostly non-beer smells : honey , orange , and some pilsner malt . t : even stronger honey taste , orange juice and rind , and some wet bread in the aftertaste . m : this has a light body with some prickly carbonation and a mostly clean finish . d : it is refreshing and would be enjoyable on the beach .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.20 0.20	clear , pale gold in hue with a steady stream of bubbles racing to the frothy white head ; at the apex the head was almost three fingers tall . this beer does look striking in my pilsner glass . head retention was very good ( but arent all miller beers ? ) . subsequent lacing was widespread . for a pale lager , this is a good looking beer . the nose smells like faint lime cleaning solution , not really natural . i was expecting it to smell somewhat like a lime corn chip , it doesnt . it is not very beery . no malt . no hops . no cereal . no salt . all i get is lime . the nose is odd very odd . i dont like it . not inviting on any level . wow ! it is like drinking a lime corn chip soaked in tequiza . i am burping it after two sips . yikes ! funky lime flavors , salty corny twang , some rice-like tackiness ( like rice cooked with too much water and then drained ) . i dont think rice was used in the brewing process but i cant explain what i taste any better . awful aftertaste i am cringing with every swallow . it is somewhat sweet and yet kind of dry . this tastes more like a shitty , cheap margarita then it does a beer with salt and lime . yuck . light in body , fairly firm carbonation , the mouthfeel is respectable for the style . truly awful . i cant believe there is a market for this beer . a year from now will miller chill be on the market ? ill bet it is not . this is much worse than i ever thought it could be . i almost sprang for a six-pack a few weeks ago thank god i didnt . one bottle is way more than i can handle . avoid .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.40	`` life begins as a quest of the child for the man and ends as a journey by the man to rediscover the child . '' -- laurens van der post honey amber with a small splash of orange juice . the head looks better than the beer . it 's three full fingers of alabaster colored foam that has more than enough tackiness to plaster the glass with lace . this is the best looking of the green 's beer so far . trouble is , i know from experience what comes next . the aroma is kinda ... sorta ... reminiscent of a tripel . like the other offerings from these guys , it has a solvent-like quality that is offputting . think golden orchard fruit soaked in paint thinner , with a whiff of phenolic clove . in the end : barely acceptable . quest is probably my favorite ( make that 'least unfavorite ' ) green 's gluten free beer to date . that does n't mean that it 's any damn good . maybe the fact that tripels are one of my favorite styles has something to do with it , who knows ? there 's quite a bit of apple fruitiness goin ' on . trouble is , the beer tastes like a mixture of bottom shelf green apple schnapps mixed with turpentine . on second thought , this one is no better than the others . each sip still makes me grimace and wonder why the hell i spent good money on beer that i knew would be lousy . maybe it 's my nearly empty stomach , but the acidity and the alcohol is giving me a serious case of gut ache and heart burn . sorry , but this bottle will be emptied in the end , just not into my glass . on a badly needed positive note , quest still looks good after multiple pours . the mouthfeel , although not horrible , is a bit thin for the style . it 's also oddly slick , which the others were as well . truthfully , when beer tastes this bad , the mouthfeel gets lost in the shuffle . it 's hard to believe that gluten-free beer has to taste this foul . i 'm sure that barley is far and away the best grain to brew with , but someone somewhere should be able to come up with something decent for those poor souls unfortunate enough to be unable to appreciate the wonders of craft beer .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.20	this is a contract brew made by mbc for the theoretical `` fletcher street brewing company , lcc '' , which does n't exist in alpena , michigan . pours out to a clear ( i.e-filtered ) pale golden , forming a tall , poofy white head with excellent retention and nice lacing . carbonation is medium-strong with spiral streamers . domestic lager aroma with some dry malts and not so spicy hops , wet grass , touches of sulfur and macro adjunct . mouthfeel is initially spritzy with a light body . does n't taste to good , honestly . there is a slight and very brief notion of hops in the beginning , followed by the taste of sweet corn and some pale malts which are unbalanced by any hop bitterness . not much better than a warm stroh 's . not recommended . this is one step above most macro swill . actually , i would take an ice-cold budweiser lite over this any day . a black mark on the otherwise good reputation of michigan brewing company . down the drain it goes .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	a- has a nice amber color to it . nice and clear . no head what so ever . s- smell of nothing but vanilla . nothing else there t- all i can taste is vanilla . no bitterness or malt . feels like there is no carbonation . 2nd bottle like this . all and all not a very good beer .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	a- cloudy amber body and a small off-white head ( barely any head ) s- sweet grapes , some sweet bready malts t- follows the nose ; at first sweet dark fruits , sweet malts and there 's some wheat body m- medium body with light carbonation and it 's almost syrupy o- i dig the style and this a good overall beer . i want more wheat wines to compare it to .

0.70 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00	pours a thin head and the color is that of mahogany colored with some maroon tones . the taste blew me away . it tastes so frikken fresh like the raspberries just came off the vine and they made it that day . best lambic i have ever had i would say . chapeau and melbourne are my 2 favorites . framboise isnt even this good .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.70	pours a pale yellow/golden color . the head is very small for a hefe . the aroma is quite pleasing . juicy banana , bread . a very nice smelling hefe . the taste is refreshing . it starts out juicy , but has a mild metalic aftertaste that leaves a bad impression . mouthfeel is creamy with nice carbonation . overall , this is a decent hefe that stays close to style . if not for the aftertaste this would be a really good brew .

1.00 0.60 0.90 0.90 1.00	there 's guinness from the tap , guinness from the can , and guinness from the bottle . if you drink enough of the stuff , you 'll come to understand - like i have - that the three sources provide three distinct variations on a theme . from the bottle is okay , from the nitro can is excellent , but from the tap ... guinness draught can be divine . which leads us to this review - the nitro can . pop the top and listen for the rush of the nitrogen as your guiness goes through a process very similar to what happens when it 's mixed at the tap . pour and watch the brew tumble to a tar-black body crowned with a tawny brown head . remember that head , because there 's a very good chance it will outlast the rest of the beer . if there 's a `` chink in the armor '' for guinness , it 's the beer 's smell . some stouts have distinct aromas , but guinness from the nitro can tends to have such a thick set of smells that nothing really comes through . instead of actual smells , i 'd tend to explain the aroma of canned guinness in terms of weights . for example , one might call the smell of canned guinness ten pounds of coffee and five pounds of chocolate in the bag for three pounds of gold . but maybe that 's just me . the taste of this beer is perfectly replicated from the tap to the can , as opposed to the bottle . those of you who 've only had tap and bottle will notice a considerable difference . personally , i find the difference to be a little repulsive , so i was glad to find out that st james ' gate brewery got it right in the nitro can . for those who no nothing of the taste of guinness , i urge you not to take my word for it . guinness is one of those beers you simply have to try for yourself , and if you like stouts or porters , i think you 'll enjoy it . mouthfeel and drinkability are unbelievably smooth and satisfying . you might as well drink a small saucer of creme if you want to know how guinness will feel going down . if you 've never tried an irish dry stout before , i think guinness would be a great way to break into the style . just be sure you have guinness on its own before you branch out into black-and-tans or irish car bombs . to experience it properly , i think you have to start with the basics .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	appearance : pours a crystal clear golden color . has a medium sized white head that quickly settles to a film quickly . i notice lots of suspeneded sediment in my glass . smell : has a great honey and floral aroma . i also pick up bubble gum and spices and a bit of pepper . taste : tons of different flavors in this beer . lemon , honey , pear , and a spices . also a very light alcohol burn . mouthfeel/drinkability : heavy carbonation and very crisp . comes off very dry . i was surprised by this because i never expect much from american versions of belgian style beers .

1.00 0.60 1.00 0.60 0.50	aroma : malty , hoppy , alcohol . appearance : amber , clear , foam is medium . taste : very hoppy , lots of roasted malt , a little raisin . slightly nutty . a dry finish . some alcohol heat . mouthfeel : smooth and creamy . alcohol warmth . drinkability : a little too hoppy to really enjoy , and the hops used are not the most flavorful .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.90	from 750 corked . dated 05/11/09 . a : light yellow body , foaming white head that subsided quickly . not much lacing but a welcoming color . clarity is brilliant - i could mistake this for a watered down generic lager based on looks but that would be a fantastic mistake . re-pours were overwhelmingly heady , perhaps because of temperature . s : lemons , wheat , belgian yeasts . delicate floral notes , dandelion and vanilla much later . t : basic tripel malt body , lemons and faint earthy bittering hops . this is not a hoppy beer by any means . this tastes less yeasty than other tripels . great overall balance of subtle smells , flavors , and high abv . spices come through halfway , hints of coriander and grains of paradise , finishing sweet . m : very carbonated . light bodied beer , despite the flavor and abv . d : extremely drinkable . the 8.4 % is only noticeable after it warms slightly . one of my favorite tripels .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70	on tap in april 2006 . note this was n't called `` mom 's '' on the menu - simply `` elderberry stout . '' since otto 's most likely only has one elderberry stout , although it may be consistant from batch to batch , i list this review here . this beer black and entirely opaque with a thick and persistant off-white head with flecks of tan in it - very nice looking beer . aroma is complex and chocolatey albeit extremely faint . the taste is dominated by roasted malt chocolate and espresso flavors . elderberries are definitely present but not so much so that they are unpleasant . this has a very heavy mouthfeel and is very creamy . not all that drinkable but pretty good overall .

0.40 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70	half liter bottle from the brewery . this is an '09 vintage bottle that we picked up on sale in july for about $ 3 canadian iirc . poured into two large snifters . appearance ( 2 ) : dark brown with reddish orange around the edges . half a finger of head which dies down to just a light cream around the edges and a sparse covering of small bubbles . not much lacing . aroma ( 4.5 ) : dark fruits , slightly sweet , cinnamon and maybe some anise . strong orange peel too . reminds me a lot of '09 anchor our special ale . top notch aromas that you would expect from a nicely balanced warmer . taste ( 3.5 ) : pretty subtle flavors up front ; a bit watery but some strong orange fruitiness . a bit of sweet caramel malt in the middle . the orange returns in the finish and there is a lingering spiciness and the dark fruit flavor from the nose . mouthfeel ( 2.5 ) : medium carbonation . a bit thin for the touch of sweetness in the nose and taste . drinkability ( 3.5 ) : definitely drinkable in that it 's not overly spiced and the abv is not apparent . not one that i 'd want to drink more than one of though .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70 0.80	sampled from a 12oz bottle in a standard pint glass . a brown molasses like color with good clarity and a moderate head of small bubbles . the head does n't last long but it 's got decent lacing . a yeasty , slightly nutty aroma . a sweet , malty flavor with a clean yeast presence ( almost like a pilsner ) . a bit thin in the mouth . a decent beer that 's pretty readily available . i happened to buy these at a gas station for tailgating before a basketball game . i picked it because the only other options were bud , miller , etc . bu it 's a decent beer .

0.50 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	a : oddly difficult to tell it 's pink , with its murky amber tone and orangey-rose tint s : funky and flowery , sweet at the end t : deliciously tart , with a mild berry finish m : the bubbles dance , making this quite a lip-licker d : i 'd love to have this every day ... imagine my delight when i saw this on the chalkboard tap list . my first time having cantillon ros de gambrinus on draught ! notes from 02.14.10 at akkurat in stockholm

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50	i 'm confused on many levels with this beer so i 'll guess i 'll start at the beginning . i could n't find a match of the exact beer i drank , however , this seemed to be the closest . could it be i acquired a really , really old or a really , really new bottle , but i have no clue for sure . the label on the bottle i 'm drinking has a coat of arms , 2 cherries and says the abv is 6.8 % . the best part of this beer is the appearance . it poured a deep , cherry red with minimal head which foamed a bit when swirled . the positive aspects of this beer stopped right there for me . the smell was the first thing that weirded me out ; maybe i was expecting more of a lambic-ness , but the smell had a funk that i found hard to place . what the hell was that smell ? dirty underwear ? the taste started okay with a tart , bitter cherry flavor but followed by a metallic nastiness that almost pressed down on the back of my tongue . seriously . the mouthfeel was uneventful and not at all pleasant . drinkable ? i 'll pass .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	i could not believe the amounts of foam flowing from the still bottle upon opening ; the pervasive kudzu-like froth that just clung to the sides of the tulip and would not budge with additional pouring . the underlying substance was a beautiful goldenrod color that sparkled through the condensation with wonderful bubbles of carbonation belying belgian yeast . on the bottom floated pinhead chunks of matte-maroon sediment just smaller than coffee grounds.there was a nice strong essence- yet still refined- of nice farmhouse style funk . what struck me was how much of a subtle mouthfeel this beer had , give the huge flavor that was in the beginning- the funky yeasty quality- the middle-the wheat-bready- giving way to a spicy/peppery yet earthy and brandy-like alcohol tinged finish . fantastic to plow through a bottle of this . quite nice when a cold spring night turns to thoughts of heat and warm days to come ...

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.60	coors light on tap , does it get any more real than this ? let 's see . it came to me in a pilsner , chilled . light clear yellow with plenty of carbonation to support absolutely no head whatsoever . hmmm . smelled lightly of malt , and corn syrup . wierd , but i guess go with what works . tasted pretty much the same . sweet , lightly malted , watered down corn syrup . very light bodied , easy to pour down the throat . the plusses , no headache . had one bud light and had a migraine . none of that business here . easy to drink several of and not be drunk . goes great with fried chicken and fried okra . so , to answer the question , yes it does get better from here . much much better , but , when out in okarche , oklahoma , god i hope i spelled okarche right , and you 're eatin ' fried chicken , coors light might be all that 's available . i think they had some miller products , and i know they had bud , but really , out of those , i 'll take a coors light any day of the week .

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90	a- brilliant clear golden color . head fades quite a bit and leaves just a ring around the glass . s- i love the smell of this beer . fresh pizza dough , sweet biscuit like malts with clean spicy hops . smells to me like a bit or corn as well . dont know if it was used in the mash or not , but it is a pleasent scent and contributes nicely to its profile . t & m- has a bit of corn flavor as well too and blends in nicely with spicy/slightly oregano like hops . it doesnt sound good i know but its actually quite good . very smooth with a slight carbonation burn on the tounge . very refreshing and a slighlty dry finish . o- a very nice beer . leaves your palate dry and makes you take another sip . very refreshing and you can get this just about anywhere too .

0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50	poured almost no head , even though the beer was almost foaming out of the bottle . strange . copper/brown color , very clear . aroma is faint , smells of whiskey . notes of prunes or a wooden barrel . some malty sweetness , mostly caramel . no noticeable hops . toasted bread taste , some oakiness . a light bitterness in the dry finish . a bit watery in the mouthfeel , carbonation too light . not particularly drinkable . the flavor seems a bit off somehow , and the smell is not particularly appetizing .

0.40 0.90 0.90 0.80 0.70	serving- 12 oz bottle , 45f , no expiration date . appearance- poured with minimal head that dispersed rapidly . opaque , cloudy apple cider-like color . this style really should have better clarity and head . smell- mouthwatering sour fruit , orange , raisin , honey-maple and spice . inviting and complex . this ale is a sniffer . no odors . a good , complex aroma . taste- this ale tastes like it could be the base for the belgian red , except without any of the cherry , sweetness is well balanced by sour and bitter . this style has a distinctive , appealing flavor . crisp , clean finish and aftertaste of malt . no vinegar or diacetyl off-flavors . pre-digestive reflection- i have an empty stomach here , but i 'm not getting a notable impression of flavor . mouth feel- medium body with just enough bubbly . jubilant feel of carbonation . this ale is not the least bit flat . not the least bit course . drinkability- appealing overall . an easy drink . the off-appearance impacts this a little . notes- a pretty decent brew overall . rememberable . smell and taste are a good example of the style . the appearance should be perfected . i may cellar some bottles of this to see how it ages .

1.00 0.70 0.80 1.00 1.00	serving : bottle with a bb date of 2/28/11 . poured into a duvel tulip glass . appearance : deep , rich , amber red . poured semi-aggressively to yield 2 fingers of nice , tan , creamy head which started to reveal some interesting pitting after a bit . moderate lacing . smell : mostly sweet malt with minimal hoppiness . taste : initially hit with malty sweetness , vanilla , cracker & biscuit , toffee , caramel . the finish is crisp , clean , and slightly bitter . a perfect balance between malt sweetness , cracker dryness , hop bitterness . mouthfeel : clean , crisp , smooth . each swirl brings about a renewed creamy smoothness . almost chewy . drinkability : this is a tasty brew that is not as biting on the finish as some vienna 's i 've had . goes down easy and is certainly satisfying . overall : probably my favorite vienna to date . i like the fact that there is a tad more sweetness to be had here than with some others i have tried . this will be a regular . update : each bottle increases the realization that this is just about the best lager i have ever had . other than celebrator ... .i can not think of another lager beer i enjoy more . an amazing beer that will always be in my fridge .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.80	a : pours sub pale straw beer with a little active carbonation and a bright white head . the head actually does n't look that bad , really textured and firm on top . very clear . s : stale . as soon as i opened the bottle the air was filled with the smell of stale rice and beer , though i know this one is pretty fresh . it just smells like the morning after a frat party . i really do n't want this to be a drain pour , but i think it will be . t : this may honestly be the most tasteless beer i 've ever drank . as it sits on my tongue , i really get nothing , it 's only when i swallow i get a little tinge of bmc style bitterness . i 'm really quaffing this beer , and i get nothing at all from it . i 've tasted water from the tap with more flavor than this . m : like water , absolutely . really nothing going on here at all . d : very high . i do n't know where it 'll get you , but it 's just like drinking water . low carbonation and everything .

0.20 0.30 0.20 0.30 0.50	this beer is horrible . looks very pale with no head , piss pale color smells skunky and bad , very light smell though considering the taste taste 's like nothing . water , co2 and skunk are the main notes . feels like seltzer in your mouth , yummmmy i 'd rather drink most other macros than this , but its still a cheapass macro so not awful straight out of a bottle at a party with a bunch of people

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.50	pours out a murky , muddy , brownish colour with a minimal head and lace . banana and cocoa in the nose ... a bit of funk and clove too . taste is a funkified fruit and yeast combination that does n't really let any other more desirable flavours shine through . the estery components , mostly sour in nature , bury any wheat notes . no clove , no banana , and little dark malt flavours to be had . mostly a watery and prickly mouthfeel underneath a medium at best body . drinkability suffers again just for the fact that i do n't find this very tasty , even for something out of the cold spring brewery . # 4 out of the five pack sampler . it seems every one gets a tad worse as i try them . not really recommended .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	served in a whiskey glass . look : brown color with ruby shades , very thin foamy head ( maybe because of the glass ) . smell : grass hops and nut malts . taste : wood hops with a waterfall of cookie and nut malts , with eart hops at the end . mouthfeel : woody , high bitterness , the body is soft for the style . drinkability : i liked the combination of wood with biscuity malts , very good .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.50	i tried this back when it was batch 371 and i got ta say as saint gootz , the experience has been vastly different . not much head at all . a murky dark brown , no lacing either . smell is fairly similar to before . cloves with some bananna . taste is smokey and not as complex as i remember it . a bit sour . i can really taste the smoked flavors.this batch was much different than the earlier one i tried and for the worse . it 's a little disturbing that a beer can change so much from batch to batch . based on this sample , which had a drink by date of march 05 so it should have been fresh , i will not be trying saint gootz again which is a shame since i really enjoyed batch 371 .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	16 oz tallboy can with a freshness stamp of mar1510 on the bottom . pours a very pale , clear yellow color with an airy white foam that fades in a matter of seconds to nothingness . even for an aal , this one does not look great . nose is light grains , cereal and a bit of sugary sweetness . surprisingly , a bit of hops are present . very light nose overall , but nothing unappealing or sour ; pretty neutral . taste is most akin to watery , spent grains . tastes kind of like corn chex cereal . carbonated water and a breath of alcohol pretty much completes the flavor profile . body is about medium for the style and carbonation is high . touch of bittering hops in the finish , and i mean the faintest of touches . this is not too shabby of a bargain aal , goes down smooth and easy ... quenches the thirst alright . decent golf beer .

0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70 0.80	poured from a 12 oz . can into a mug . a : hazy light straw color . a large amount of frothy white head that leaves sticky but bubbly lacing . medium carbonation . s : strawy and light . hint of mild fruits , and maybe coriander ? overall , weakish but pleasant . t : mild bitter hops at first . subtle , smooth malts in the middle . creamy , sugar finish . m : dryish , and leaves a nip in the mouth . d : not bad . nothing about this beer turns me off , really , so i could drink a few . overall , a pretty good pilsener . certainly drinkable and pleasant smelling/tasting , but nothing made me say , `` wow , that was good . ''

0.20 0.60 0.60 0.70 0.40	opened a 22oz bottle last night and it exploded with foam all in the kitchen sink . after the initial burst , it still was foaming like mad as i poured it into the glasses . this beer was way too over-carbonated , i must have picked up a bad bottle . i managed to only salvage about half a pint glass of beer each for me and my wife . i figured we should at least try a sip or two to see what it tastes like . actually , it was n't too bad . it was red colored ( obviously ) but had a nice apple flavor aspect to it . a bit better than i expected . too bad that we were only able to have about 4 oz each . as i am not a huge fan of irish reds to begin with , i was n't expecting much . but this one let me down .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70	pours a beautiful dark brown with a slight ruby hue on the outer edges , nice thick microfoam head that leaves nice lacing . slight aroma of deep and sucrose-like maltiness . taste is very pleasent ... bitter chocalate upfront , rich maltiness in the middle , finished with a dry warming senstation in the back of the throat . also sense a bit of vanilla in there somehwere . mouthfeel is a bit disappointing , was hoping for a bigger fuller feel . overall , i 'm glad a tried and it is interesting indeed . but will probably hold off on having another , too many other delectable porters out there .

0.30 0.70 0.50 0.50 0.50	had this beer at a stop gap in atlanta at a place nmed spondivit 's . it could have been the name or the place , but i really did n't enjoy this beer . i noticed the straw color in the 32oz mug i was drinking from with two inches of head ( mistake by my rookie bartender . ) i tasted this beer and it was really sweet tasting . it was hard work , but i finished this tall drink of citris cooler and made my way to the old stand-by . i do not reccomend even a try it was not special .

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.50	drank this from a bottle then poured into glass mug . the appearenc is more towards a yellow then orangish bud light.the scent.is of course a strong lime eventhough i still recognize the bud light.the tases pretty much is the same as the smell . the mouthfeel kinda sucked for what i expected from a light beer.and the drinkability is mediocre with no outstanding qualities . other notes=eventhough it is very carbonated the head dissapates very quicklyand is not rettained at all.also.there was absolutely nooo lacing whatsoever .

1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90	special thanks to n. ketchum for the opportunity to finally try this brew . poured out of a 16.9 oz bottle into a tulip style glass . the bottle had a freshness date of 8/9/11 a ) a sleek orange . i held it up to the sun on my patio and admired it for a few seconds . ( cue music ) there were two inches of white head that led to a nice white cap that never dissipated . the lacing was great , and followed all the way down . s ) pine and citrus fruit . this was not over powering , just very pleasant . there was also a bit of sweetness , that seems to hint at apricots . t ) follows the nose with precision . the 8 % abv is not even detectable . this is so smooth . there is a nice grassy finish that departs just in time for the next sip . m ) a medium body that really pleases the palate . the carbonation is perfect . this beer is refreshing and smooth . o ) this one lives up to the hype and then some . my only regret is having just two bottles left to enjoy .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.70	a surprisingly light straw color for this beer , which i expected to be pale ... but this is pale . one of my favorite reviews of this beer comes from the very observant cellarman . its a hop-focused beer for lager lovers . which somehow seems to be mutually exclusive . but this stuff sells like hot-cakes around butte county when it comes out . i found some strangely clove-y textures as this beer got down to the end as well , which i found intriguing but i wondered how i woudl respond to this trait as a session beer . i 'd love to snatch a six when it comes to stores , but its popularity keeps it under wraps except for a few lucky californians .

0.20 0.20 0.30 0.20 0.20	my buddies and i went on our annual deer hunting trip , and one of my friends bought a can of this bud clamato stuff because it sounded bizarre . so me and two other guys gave it a try back at our hunting cabin . it was one of the tall boy cans . appearance : i did n't pour it into a glass , we just passed the can around , taking sips . but after just a handful of sips , this stuff was so absolutely vile that we poured it down the drain . as the noxious fluid began to glug out of the can , i noticed it was a pale pinkish color at first , and then the color rapidly darkened . right before the can emptied , the color had darkened to a light red . as if the taste was n't god-awful , the color and appearance were also nasty . it looked like the stuff separated inside the can , with watery stuff on top , and tomato gook settling on the bottom . it appeared like you either needed to shake the beer in the can ( which is completely counterintuitive ) , or pour it into a glass and then mix it with a swizzle stick . ugh ! smell : i took several deep wafts from the top of the can before i sipped . if you ever had a crazy party and somebody spilled a really bad budweiser beer into the hot salsa chip-dip bowl , and left it sitting there overnight -- it sort of smelled like that . as we poured the stuff down the drain , and the color thickened , the stench from the can grew exponentially , until people several feet away from the emergency beer-purge were audibly gasping in alarm and disgust . taste : absolutely vile . this is either the worst beer i 've ever had , or the second worst . it was really that bad . it had a very salty aftertaste , as i recall . i 'm not 100 % sure on the salty thing , though , because i 've read that when a person has experienced severe trauma , the brain tries to protect itself by shutting down and blotting out the memory . so i might need a hypnotist to try and unlock some portions of the experience . i do remember , quite vividly , that before i took a sip , i expected to get budweiser 's famously bland taste with hints of tomato . instead , i got assaulted with obnoxious salsa , tomato juice , and spices . the `` beer '' was totally overwhelmed . and what faint traces of `` beer '' taste i could manage to make out , was worse than the stuff budweiser usually tries to pass off as a sorry excuse for beer . after just a single sip , i took another whiff of the can , and began to feel ill . i passed it to the next guy with a funky expression on my face . nobody managed to take a second sip . it was that horrible . shortly thereafter , we poured it down the drain . mouthfeel . it was more viscous than a regular beer -- just as you would expect from something mixed with tomato juice . but it did have the trademark budweiser harsh carbonation . for some reason , budweiser 's bubbles in their beer make them uniquely undrinkable . drinkability . totally and completely undrinkable . horrendous smell and taste . vile appearance . poor mouthfeel . just a bad concept for a beer overall . my guess is that some idiot in marketing uttered the word `` chelada '' in an authentic sounding spanish accent , and this convinced the rest of the marketing team that bud needed to launch something bold to get that hispanic market . maybe the people who came up with this beer were hammered on tequila already .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	hazy golden body , topped by three fingers of slightly off-white rocky micro-bubbles . good lacing . piney aroma , but requires a really deep sniff . sweet beginning , followed by astrigent pine . some earthy hop sense . slight sense of alcohol . tastes unlike any iipa i 've had . lakes dimensions . firm medium mouthfeel . overall , not an enjoyable beer , and my least favorite iipa ever . having completed my tasting of the first wave of epic products , i 'll pass on the second wave now arriving .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60 0.30	sampled in a home tasting with the entire brewer patriot collection . a - ruby brown solid with moderate carbonation . s - wow , smells like a woke up hungover after chain smoking all night . t - buttery super smoked taste that fills rapidly . feels almost fatty going down . m - oily & vicous & fatty . d - very filling . there is no way i could swallow another ( and i only had 1/4 a bottle ) .

0.40 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.70	sampled bottle at work 11/09/07 . appearance : pours a light amber colour with a white head diminishing quickly to a thin ring . aroma : sweet , grainy , some grass . taste : malty backbone , sweet . mouthfeel : sharp , highish carbonation . final statement : not a bad beer at all but another classic example of the a brewery calling their beer a honey brown and it not being brown . i do n't get that . either way , an average boring beer that is n't bad .

0.30 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.80	appearance - clear amber , very little head that dissapates quickly and leaves no lace . carbonation leaves much to be desired . not very inviting appearance . smell - citrusy and piney at different samplings . taste - very tasty red lager , though piney mouthfeel - almost escapes the tongue as soon as i swallow , though while it is present it is light , yet smooth and seems to produce carbonation unseen in the glass i was drinking from . drinkability - i would n't mind another , but i 'd probably lean towards a new ( untried ) beer or a higher quality beer before choosing this .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.80	strong coffiee , black and rich and hops with a burnt malt as the finish , this is like beer meets campfire coffiee ( smud coffiee as i call it ) , this is like coffiee on the warmer all day , this is great i could drink this with steak and eggs . this beer makes me wonder why thay havent invented a hop flavored coffiee creamer , hell maby i have stumbled on to somthing . back to the beer at hand , this is the second best coffiee stout i have ever had , the first is wake and bake from terripin . if you can get one of theese take the oppertuinity , i wish i had goten more ! !

0.80 0.60 0.30 0.30 0.40	pours out to a slightly hazy light amber with orange accents , forming a large light beige head after a vigorous pour . head is sea-foam in consistency and has ok retention with sparse lacing . aroma is of dry cloves , a faint whiff of bananas , apricots , a crisp toasted wheat note , wyeast belgian wit yeast aromatics , and diabetic urine ( seriously ) . mouthfeel is spritzy , with a watery thin body . taste begins with florid carbonation , immediately fading into a thin bitterness with nary a hint of hop flavor or aroma ... more of a tannic bitterness , like oversteeped black tea . there is a toasty note in the middle , a mentionable complete lack of malt body or sugar , followed by more chemical bitterness in the watery , thin finish . the finish reminds me of chewing a tylenol . in the aftertaste , i tend to pick up roasted barley astringency and some isopropyl alcohol . as it warms , the alcohol becomes obtrusive and drys out the mouth . highly overrated , and nothing i would care to drink again .

0.20 0.20 0.30 0.20 0.30	appearance - watered-down apple juice , or perhaps just tainted water . looks to be about 1 part urine and 9 parts water . keith stone . always water . always . smell - non-existent . light lager-like malt if searched for . dirty dish water . taste - for the people defending this and saying , `` review it for what it is ! '' . . . i am reviewing it for what it is . compared to bud , miller , and even coors light ; this is just downright the worst . water sprayed with lemon pledge . mouthfeel and drinkability - i 'll admit it 's smooth . but it tastes abysmal . unfortunately i have eight more of these to drink .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.70	this is really an experimental beer , and i had a hard time categorizing it . it 's a collaborative beer , brewed by del borgo in conjunction with a traditional grain miller . what makes it unique is the use of enkir ( einkorn wheat ) , a pre-historic cereal grain that was abundant thousands of years ago in the fertile crescent . the beer seems to be brewed primarily with malted barley , with a healthy dose of enkir added , and a modest hop addition . it has a yeasty , very wheat and twang character at first . there 's a sourdough bread and slightly sugary aroma . no real hop smell at all . the taste is quite sweet , with a very interesting , cereal quality . it 's almost acidic and starchy , but very interesting . there is , however , quite a bit of pale malt character and a decent belgian-like yeast quality . a small about of fruity esters are also present . no hop flavor either , but there is a bit of balancing hop bitterness . there could be more : the beer is not really well balanced . very interesting , a good experiment .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60	a : golden hazy , and choc full of sediment . this is the second variety i 've had from this brewery in the 12oz bottle that i 've had trouble keeping the sediment out of my glass . so , my perception of color maybe off from loads of sediment suspended throughout my glass . the head is fluffy , nice retention , and leaves lacey legs on the glass . s : a sharp lemon scent leads the aroma , but there is also a sugary backbone . t : also lemon - a bit like pledge . the citrus tone just seemed like artificial flavoring . it then goes into floral hops and yeast . the last taste in the mouth is a faint licorice . m : medium body , fine carbonation , and sharp bitterness .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.70	poured from a green 12 oz . bottle . has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head . smell is of sweet limes . taste is also of limes , not very sweet , very little else going on . feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability . overall this is a mediocre beer .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.50 0.60	a . pours out to a light yellow with a nice thick white head with some very good retention and nice lacing on the glass . the carbonation is very good . s. the smell is some cereal grains with a little bit of hops . t. the taste is cereal grains , corn that finishes off with some hops in the back and a hint of pepper . m/o . the mouthfeel is a crisp clean smooth easy to drink feel that is made for the masses to drink . overall i was not impressed with this beer . after hearing how great this beer is all i can say is i 'll stick with stella for a euro pale lager that is massed produced .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.70	mythos from greece : a hellenic lager , in a 11.5 ounce green bottle . strong euro-skunk aroma . thick white head , long lasting , with pronounced belgian lace . light bodied , deep golden color . very light and refreshing . nice balance between malt sweetness , and a hops bite . long lasting caramel after taste . not bad .

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.40	poured from the bottle into a tulip . there are such a few amount of reviews out there for this beer . i do n't know if it 's from the price tag alone or from people who buy it refusing to put how disappointing this beer is into words . time to add one more negative deviation to my review count ... . the pour of this beer , aside from the fantastic 2+ fingers worth of head , was foreboding . more so than hitchcock 's opening to rebbecca . the appearance , in a word , was septic . i feared for my life and grabbed for a knife thinking that the creature from the black lagoon was going to pop out at any time and strike . okay , the lacing was nice . but the creature from the black lagoon could rip through nice curtains . the smell was just okay at best . there was caramel , raisins and a decent touch of hops in the mix . the oak barrel aging was noticeable in the smell , but not truly welcome . the taste . meh . i 've had plenty better in this style , that did n't cost so fucking much too . the mild hop profile blended well with the oak aging and fruit flavors , the raisins , maybe other dark fruits and the caramel again . my buddy noted it 's like bigfoot ale , we both agreed that that 's better though . there 's an earthyness to this beer though that probably comes from the oak aging and in this case , i do n't think adding it to the barrels truly in the end added a damn thing to the beer . it was more of an unwelcome house guest , one you ca n't say no to , you wish he was gone , but to keep up appearances you had to grin and bare his presence . the mouthfeel was okay , it was thick but not overbearing , something you can easily drink and enjoy . this beer has a twenty-six dollar price tag on it . that 's a lot of freaking money ! and i definitly say that it simply is not worth the money . i 've had much better beer in this style for a lot less money . this beer is rather pretentious . there 's limited quantities , it was aged in oak ( for no apparent reason ) and comes with a laughable price tag . if a beer was to ever sit in a proverbial ivory tower , this would be it . i wonder if the reviews are so high because people spent so much money on a beer , they want to believe it 's good . who wants to spend this much money and be disappointed ? if this beer was say , $ 8 , how much lower would the score be ? how much does scarcity and steep prices affect the psyche of the reviewer ? how much does it add to the disdain ? i can answer that , at least sixteen dollars worth .

1.00 0.50 1.00 1.00 0.80	it 's darker than i remember it from the tap and , honestly , it was difficult to get the size head that i wanted . i only managed half a finger . the body is a hazy orange , but on the brown of amber . i 'm not all too impressed with the nose . i 've got a strong floral scent , and not much else that i can sort through except an undertone of pine . i 'm not sure i can sort through everything that 's there . as i remember , each sip is unique . the brown sugar enriches the edges of your tongue surrounding the middle that moves from citrus , to pine , to ginger , molasses , peppermint , coriander , bread , caramel , maple -- oh yeah , and it has a hop character . this beer sits heavy , but the mouth feel certainly is not . that 's thanks to a heavy carbonation , but not noticeably so . it 's necessary to sift through this brew . warms the throat and leaves an aftertaste of ... everything on the front of the tongue .

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.70	the silver bullet . a crappy looking beer , it pours the normal golden color of just about any macro beer around , looks very flat and watery . the smells are faint , although i notice some malt character . the taste is unimpressive . not bad tasting by any means , but there 's just not much to it . quite boring . mabye a little to watery . the mouthfeel is thin , but i wouldnt have really expected anything else . very drinkable and quite easy to consume mass quantities . this is not a bad beer for a summer afternoon grill-out ... if its free .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40	this ipa pours nicely..has the amber color of an ipa good head and lacing ... downhill from this the smell is of kerosene i dont know what else i detect faint hops some malt.. the taste is just as bad no floral citrus no herb/hop just an old smelly/tastng beer that you stole from your dad when you were 16 .. this is the worse ipa ive reviewed ..thank god i bought a single.. its a drainer dont try this one

1.00 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	appearence - ahhhh . . . this is the way a beer is supposed to look . almost black with a cream colored head measuring maybe one finger . one of the most delightful things about the beer is the process before you actually drink it . i love pouring it out of the gan into a pint glass and watching it mix and cascade turning from the color of mud to the color of . . . perfection smell - not a very powerful smell , slightly rusty odor taste - tastes of roasted malt , semi-nutty , almost a bit of salt to it , i have heard it described as slightly reminiscent of soy sauce , i do n't think so however mouthfeel - light , almost watery , from its taste and appearence , you would think it would be thicker and heavier . drinkability - goes down smooth , due to its light mouthfeel , i would describe this beer as quite sessionable once you get used to the strong taste

0.40 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	appearance : bright , golden macro-yellow . huge , audible bubbles . volatile white head struggles to establish itself , then dissipates very quickly . smell : slightly burnt kettle corn , sweet and almost buttery . toasty cracker-like multigrain aroma in the background . mild estery notes . taste : sweet and grainy like corn or lightly buttered wonder bread . sugary like a simple syrup . extremely understated lemony-herbal hop edge that does virtually nothing to balance the malts . the 8.1 % abv is completely hidden except in the back of the throat on the way down , which totally bewilders me considering how light and simple this is . mouthfeel : airy with a bit of spicy zip . medium bodied and somewhat chewy . surprisingly clean for how syrupy it tastes . drinkability : clearly crafted in a german mold , this is a very sweet lager . it lacks depth and is not much fun to drink on its own , but it would do nicely with sausage . in fact , it would be perfect for cooking brats .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	i was able to have multiple tastings of this during boise base camp week . it happened to coincide with deschutes ' 23rd anniversary , and they were offering side-by-side tastings of the xxii and xxiii at several venues around town . depending on which part of the bottle you 're pouring from , the appearance seems to be drastically different . the first pour i had was right off the top of a freshly opened bottle and was filled with brown `` floaties '' . these were the particles of undissolved chocolate that precluded the release of the bottles . initially , i had appearance rated at a 1 in my notes , but subsequent pours from lower in the bottle looked absolutely gorgeous with no floaties to be seen . i assume that if you poured a whole bottle ( or more realistically , half a bottle ) , then the appearance would n't be so bad . therefore , i just gave it an average score . that said , here 's the rest of a `` normal '' review . it pours a murky brown color out of the bottle that becomes a deep black in the glass . about 3/4 inch tan head develops with good retention and a solid amount of sticky lacing . it smells of sweet sugar , chocolate , caramel , faint roasted malts , orange , and a little chili . the taste brings out a bit more of this chili flavor , though it is the orange and chocolate that really shine . faint caramel , and an almost potato-like starch flavor finish it off . mouth is smooth , rich , amply carbonated , and has a sticky , dry finish . overall , a solid beer save for the odd appearance . i 'm very pleased i was able to try this , and would recommend anyone make the effort to do so if possible .

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90 0.80	many thanks to guezelover for this one . i think its a 2006 bottle . now i do n't think i have given many 5 's for appearance but man this one was awesome . just an absolutely pitch black beer that poured like motor oil and had one of the darkest , longest lasting heads i have seen on an imperial stout . great to look at . smells of light chocolate , coffee , vanilla , roasted malts , oatmeal , and a slightly odd spiced alcohol smell that rubbed me the wrong way . i think the smell might come from stale coffee . the weird smell does n't transfer to the taste . its a nice chocolate and coffee dominate with a really pleasant lingering bitterness and other subtle flavors that translate form the smell . a nice thick beer from the oats . it definitely coats the mouth and its very big bodied and still pleasantly carbonated . that one smell was sort of off putting but otherwise this was a really great breakfast stout . i think i would like to try it again fresh . the abv sort of hits hard after a while too .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.50	thanks to irishct15 for the bottle ! poured into a hill farmstead tasting glass . a big , thick , creamy , dark-tan head forms on top of an opaque black body . swirling leaves some nice lacing behind . the nose contains light bourbon , chocolate and a bit of sour cherry . hmmm ... hopefully this is n't infected . light vanilla and oak , rounded out with a touch of alcohol . bourbon and vinous chocolate on the tongue . followed by chocolate , wood and alcohol . hint of vinegar . not overly exciting . possibly infected . mouthfeel is somewhat thin and foamy . under carbonated . some warming alcohol . drinkability is sub-par . i have a bottle of black albert open next to this and it is so much better . maybe i just have a bad bottle , but this beer seems fairly flawed .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	magic hat # 9 was left at my house after a party . this seems to be the ubiquitous high school/college party girl drink for some reason . # 9 pours a very clear yellow with tons of bubbles , but only a very slight head that soon reduces to nothing . smells are initially very fruity . a very sharp apricot taste rules . some slightly bready malt aromas linger . the maltiness does come out a bit more in the taste , but unfortunately , it is drowned out by the overbearing fruit . some breadiness , doughiness is most apparent . the hop note is slight , yet sharply floral , and easily missed . this brew delivers a blast of apricot with each sip along with a sick-sweetness that makes it hard to drink . mouthfeel ok. well carbonated , and does a good job of scrubbing the tongue after each sip , leaving hints of bready malt ( more apparent in the aftertaste than in the actual taste ) . ends slightly dry . i had one or two of these the other night , after a few torpedoes of course , and thought it did n't taste too bad . upon fresh review , i find this beer to be difficult unless you really like the apricot taste , or are a fan of fruit beers that are more fruit than beer .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.80	pours a tan liquid that compares to chocolate milk at first . there is something hypnotic about watching the beer cascade into a jet black liquid with a wonderful tan thick creamy head . to me , the head on this is the best of almost any beer , and has a unique look . smells slightly of coffee , almost a burnt smell . taste is a good roasted coffee flavor , with a hint of chocolate . feels a little thin for what i would like . i do find this to be very drinkable . many people trash this beer now . i understand that it does n't taste as it once did , and what get in the us ( from canada ) is almost an insult . still , i find myself coming back to this beer now and again . i think it goes great with irish food , and there is just something attractive about this beer .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.70	2011 batch 1 - 750ml bottle poured into a cbs snifter a : black as night . gorgeous finger-and-a-half dark brown head that leaves a nice full cap throughout consumption . s : roasted barley , earthy tabacco and root beer . faint root beer ... thankfully not very strong . t : a good dose of dark chocolate nicely balanced with the gesho root . alcohol is pretty well hidden . toffee/caramel quickly pops in to say hello . the finish has a somewhat acrid bitterness . m : carbonation is right where i like it for my stouts ... very creamy . the beer finishes quite dry and astringent . the dryness combined with the ashy bitterness concerns me a bit in terms of overall drinkability . o : i have been wanting to try this since i saw it on the first episode of brewmasters . overall i thought it was good and ill refill my glass again , but i dont know if ill seek more of these bottles out . maybe it 's more enjoyable paired with the right food .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	out of hand-numbered bottle # 1219 of 3317 this dipa was a cloudy amber color . the three-finger beige head displayed great retention as a fluffy cap . eventually the cap became rocky and left little islands of foam floating atop the liquid . the lacing was also excellent , in curtains ; top marks for appearance . the aroma was dense , lots of floral hops , citrus notes , some pine and alcohol . the flavors were also outstanding , starting with honey it then went into a bouquet of floral notes , grapefruit , light pine , sweet malt and alcohol . notably acidic . tight , tart and well balanced with enough sweetness to handle the bitter elements . the mouthfeel was good , the body full and the carbonation correct for the style .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.80	i had always been wanting to try this as one of my quests with beer is to gradually try higher and higher abv beers but at the same time , find stuff that i like as sometimes the high alcohol starts to take away from some of the characteristics that i think a beer should have . this beer starts to cross that line as the alcohol is so hot on your tounge that it starts to take away from the coffee/chocolate taste that you want from a nice imperial stout . the look is very impressive as it pours a thick dark black . i enjoyed sipping it and i will probably buy another one down the line as this beer almost has a mystical quality to me but it is n't my favorite imperial stout . edit-drank it for the second time tonight in front of a fire with no work tomorrow because of the fourth of july holiday . in the last few months , i think i have developed a more refined taste for good beer . that coupled with the fact that dogfish head no longer distributes to wisconsin gives this beer an even more `` mystical '' quality than it did in march . i have a few more in the cellar and i am hesitant to drink them for fear of not being able to find it anymore . i liked it a lot better the second time . although both bottles i have had are from the same vintage , do they age a little differently depending on the bottle ? this one was n't as hot with the alcohol . again , maybe i have more of a taste for it now but with the alcohol not being as hot on the tounge , i was able to pick out a fair amount of dried fruit and that good old imperial stout flavor that i love . that said , it is still a little too syrupy for me to be right up there with my favorite i.stouts but i will nonetheless raise my score on this one a bit .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.50	12 oz bottle poured into pint glass . clear piss/apple juice color with a bit of chill haze . thin fizzy white head that fades to a sickly smattering of froth . diacetyl aroma with a sweet butteriness and possibly some corn ? no hallmark wheat notes . flavor is essentially carbonated diacetyl with a grainy undercurrent . high carbonation , thin body . not recommended .

0.20 0.20 0.40 0.40 0.20	i was pretty excited to find a new beer on-tap from paper city , but i was a bit skeptical having it at big city in allston , ma . what the hell , i 'll try it and support something new . the beer was presented as a very light pale offering in a american tumbler , absolutely flat and chill-hazed . aroma was extremely fruity , sweet and a stale oxygen taint that immediately put me off . i then tasted the beer . remember those little libby fruit cups with the tin pull-tops ? inside was a cornucopia of irradiated fruits , like peaches , pears , grapes and that illusive single cherry treasure . remember the juice ? the sweet fruity concoction formed from the marriage of these fine fruits . that 's exactly what this beer tasted like . the juice from a libby 's fruit cup . now i 'm not sure if this was how the beer was supposed to taste like this or if this was yet again another beer tainted by the sunset bar & grill beer curse ( bad lines / old beer ) or a combination of both ... but this was absolutely foul . a beer like this , or in this condition , should simply not exist . and the beer is called one eared monkey not one eyed money like the sunset bar & grill chain is advertising . its also a pale ale with peach flavoring , not a belgian ale like i was told by big city staff .

0.60 0.60 1.00 1.00 1.00	wow i am very impressed with this beer . reviewing and drinking at the same time . i started with 2 macro brews and then moved onto a bottle of this to my face . i am not the type that like enjoys very malty super sweet brews with alot of dark fruit/alcohol kick . this does that but is very subtle about it . the mouthfeel is very light for what it is . this drink is also very very drinkable and gets you retarded . i 'm in fact very surprised i can type coherent sentences . defiantly get and try this this smell is not appetizing but the drink is simply divine . sidenotes - i only drank this and 2 bottles of cheap pilsner , i am not a light weight by any means . - thank god for spell check .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	light golden color with a full , wispy head of foam . authentic belgian smell , some dough , light fruits , farmhouse character . quite vibrant . lots of taste , with expressive citrus and herbal hop notes , hints of fruits . nice belgian character as well . very full bodied . an impressive brew .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.90	pours a dark black with a thin , tan head into my tulip . yep , pretty much the standard for a stout . as the aromas open up to room temperature , chocolate notes pour out followed by only the slightest hint of coffee . taste starts out with a strong chocolate note that as it nears the back of the throat , transforms into a strong note of coffee with a slight hint of bitterness . mouthfeel is full of lingering coffee with a slight afterburn and high carbonation . certainly seems more like a 60 choklat/40 jahva combination to me . very decent .

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.60	i like this beer for its experimentation . i think its not there though . it pours as an unfiltered nightmare . looks like pina colada . its sort of smell like it too outside of coconut oil . and the booziness of wine in the nose . wine abv makes it feel like a wine cooler . heavy handed pine apple sweet bread . i do n't like this beer because i can tell its only the beginning to something great . definite possibility but trapped in the questionable expensive beer should mess you up but be drinkable thing . can be quite drinkable if not so thick . but triple and wine ... surprised it has n't been done before . i wish this idea great success .

0.90 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.40	good god this beer is gon na be great ... frothy tan head that could get up and walk out of the room if it wanted to ... chunky . dark copper brown . yummy looking . smell some angry bitter malts ... how can malts be bitter i dont know but i smell malt nad a bitter angry flavor . tastes awful to be totally honest . sour aftertaste the grinds on you . really not sure what the brewer was thinking when he/she bottled this baby ... .i guess they wanted to get it off the premises as soon as possible . i was puckering up like i just had a straight shot of lime juice . its like that chick that looks great from across the bar and you get close and say wtf ! ! ! next .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70	a : very dark , clear when held to the light with red and orange highlights . s : strange , slightly sweaty , almost fishy . hints of bubblegum and candy . t : nice rich malt flavour . liquorice , orange , dark candi sugar . good complexity , a nice winter warmer . m : big , thick mouthfeel . well carbonated . perhaps slightly too sticky . d : good , drinkable beer - a nice one for sipping through the winter evenings .

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.80	poured nice gold color with a generous stiff white head . aromas of grain , hops , straw . taste of slighty sour malt , mild hops , yeast . reminded me of many now-gone american beers from my youth - schmidts , ortieb , and shaefer and carling come to mind . it 's not the greatest , and it 's between a lager and a pilsener in character . there are better examples of both but if it 's karlovacko or bud light , go with the k .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.80	olympia beer is something i am biased on . i have grown up in the town of olympia and thus have watched it go from a decent local beer to absolutely nothing . old olympia beers were much much better . miller purchased the olympia brewery and then shut it down . 400+ people became unemployed . olympia 's slogan was `` it 's the water ! '' modeled after the artesian springs from where the water used to brew the beer is from . the artesian springs here are no joke . simply some of the best most pure and tasty water known to mankind . you simply can not compare . now that olympia beer is no longer being brewed with this water , the beer quality has dropped significantly , and the trademark `` oly subby '' bottle has been discontinued . a local restaurant used to serve `` pasta a-la oly '' which was spinach pasta in a tasty butter sauce surrounding an olympia stubby bottle . it had class and character and local heritage written all over it . now it is no longer possible . miller has been served right by being bought out by south african brewing company . overall , olympia beer even through it 's horrible new production value has still managed to usually reign as king of beers to me . it beats the crap out of pbr , miller , budweiser , coors , etc ... anything else in that american domestic pisswater class . it 's the baby piss i choose to drink regularly when on a budget , and so should you , just to maintain heritidge . okay , a rainier once in a while is okay ... and honestly , sessions is a pretty mean olympia stubby knockoff ...

1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured from a bottle into sn hop pint glass . a : pours a light golden with a couple fingers of dense white head that reduced very slowly into a thick frothy head . beautiful rings/sheets of lacing left with every sip . s : light hops and sweet malt . very fresh and clean smelling and inviting . slight exotic fruit notes and light caramel . t : a full taste of malt with some subtle bitter hops . very subtle and refreshingly clean flavors . bitterness hits first but is comfortable and balanced by sweet malt . very earthy tasting . aftertaste is full of light fruits and some doughy biscuits . m : smooth carbonation and well balanced flavors . d : this is a true classic . this to me looks and tastes like a beer . i love all kinds of styles , this type is n't even my favorite , but when someone says `` beer '' this is what i think of . extremely drinkable .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.60	appearaence for awhile , i wondered , why do they call themselves duck-rabbit when theres just a picture of a rabbit on the bottle ? and then i saw the duck . anyways . this beer pours a deep ghastly brown with a hint of mahogany to it . a few fingers of head disappear very quickly . the film thats left on top of the beer is actually putting on some kind of show as it pops around like twinkling stars . smell definitely smells like a doppelbock . its been awhile since ive had a good one so i am excited . deep , dark fruits and malt . a bit of a plum/cocoa mix to it as well . very light chocolate . taste a surprisingly different doppelbock . a very light and tart cranberry note grabs my attention first . then , we get more of the darker fruits such as plum and dark cherry . the beer itself remains lightly tart throughout . very faint hints of caramel and cocoa . mouthfeel and overall the tartness and oddity of the weight can get to you a bit , but its pretty solid other than that . you can definitely feel the alcohol burn during breaks . overall , a pleasantly tart doppelbock without the heavy malt . edit : wow . so that alcoholic tartness definitely gets to you further down in the beer . i had to lower my score a bit .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.30 0.50	i 'm beginging to notice a trend with sam adams brew . they all look great , but thats about it . nice one finger creamy off-white head , great retention and lacing as well . color is a deep copper , the color of cherry stained wood , red and ruby hues . aroma : strong malt backbone , but lacks the sweet smell that 's usually found in this style . some diacetyl and a metallic tang . not that impressed witht the aroma of this one . some faint hop aromas-noble ? before i even taste this brew i 'm going to predict a metallic tang . not only does the aroma hint at this but so do the previous sam adams brews i 've reviewed . not as much metallic tang as the others but there 's a bit in there . this brew also has a smoky flavor , along with some graininess to it . some dark grains and bitterness from roasted grains . in my opinion this brew is a very poor example of a scotch ale . nothing like traquir jacobite , i mean it should n't be just like it but i would n't even classifiy it as being a scotch ale . the abv is n't even high enough to classify it as a scotch ale , scottish yes , but not scotch . the brw is n't sweet enough to be balanced out by a higher alcohol content-a very common characteristic of scotch ales . this brew is way off the mark . mouthfeel of this brew is pretty good . creamy in the mouth with a medium-heavy body , and lower carbonation ... well at least for sam adams . i would not buy this beer again . it is a complete let down . i was looking forward to a scotch ale , and well this should n't be classified as one . there are definitely better examples of the style out there if you 're looking to try a scotch ale do n't look here .

0.40 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.90	came in a 22 oz . bomber with wax on top ; served in a pint glass . pours a deep amber with reddish hues with a half-finger head that dies quickly . leaves very little lacing . smells sweet and sugary , yet dark -- raisins , butter , and plums . tastes really buttery and sweet , but also somewhat dark . an average mouthfeel , a little thin . this stuff smells great . a very unique sweet plummy/buttery smell . tastes good , too . does n't taste like 9 % at all . not impressed with the appearance though . all in all , a very good try on a belgian style by anderson valley . i want to try their tripel now .

0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50 0.50	bb 03-07 . litle head and a amberbrown beercolor with white haze and big flocks floating . nose is very candy sugar like , sour cherry and blackcurrant aswell as somecaramellic malts . taste is dry and very alcoholic and with that flat . hard to tell that they used hops for this and overall alcoholwater mouthfeel dominates . drinkable brew but imo litle boring .

1.00 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90	had a chuckle at the store over the label , then noticed the strength & wondered how a 10 % ipa worked , so i picked up a bottle . pours out a dark orange , w/ a really thick light peach head , takes a bit to fill the mug . kinda gives off a herbal smell , a bit of pear in there too ( at least that 's what it smells like to me ) , though that does n't stay for long . so where 's it go ? only one way to find out ... wow ... there it is ! the hops come in on a warming , somewhat boozy wave , prominent without annoying my mouth . more savory than bitter , very little carbonation and not much malt note to speak of . shifts towards a sweetness as it goes down , surprising considering the style . i 've got to say , the imperial ipa style is a nice change of pace , and if the rest of it is in the league of this beer then count me as a fan .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.80	on tap o'brien 's pub san diego , ca black with a lot of visible carbonation and a thin brown head . regular , lined lacing down the glass . very attractive and perfect for a black ipa . roasted malts and pine aromas combine , though i would suggest that the roast is fairly dominant . i would love to have seen more pine and citrus hop presence in the aroma , though this is certainly above average and worth sniffing . the flavor is similar to the aroma . roasted malt , a bit of char , and some pine combine , along with a relatively high amount of bitterness . this beer is relatively well balanced , but i think it would be better with more of a biting , pine hop presence . medium to thick mouthfeel . great . sierra nevada beers almost always shine here . a fine black ipa . i just wish it was a little less balanced : more hoppy and less roasty .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.70	2009 edition a- this one pours a black as can be body with a very small coffee colored head on a vigorous pour . might be an undercarbonated bottle . wouldnt be the first time . the head is fading fast and leaves a wall of lacing behind . s- this one smells mean . immediately i notice lots of dark and burnt smelling malts . faint notes of brown sugar also . there are some fruits , raisins and figs . and a little bit of coffee/hops at the end along with alcohol . t- massively dark and burned malts come up first . lots of the raisins i could smell , but not as much fig . alot of alcohol in this one . alot dryer than i expected . slight amounts of chocolate in this . loads of bitterness from coffee/hops at the end . complex and aggressive . m- thick and sticky lots of pleasant warming from all the alcohol . a nice low level of carbonation that really works for this one . d- this one was a treat , but too powerful to have another one . glad i decided to pick this one up , and ill try this year again when the next vintage comes out . lost abbey makes some solid beers .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.40	$ 1.99 for a stubby 12oz bottle @ bevco . abv : 5.0 % ibus : 38.0 brewed with wheat and pale malts . hopped with willamette and perl . michigan bitter cherries are tossed into the secondary . pours out to a clear medium amber with ruby highlights , forming a modest off light yellow head with ok retention and nice sheets of lace . carbonation is medium . the nose is tart with green kiwi fruit , cherries , and sour aluminum . the mouthfeel is tart with a medium body . the taste opens with some peculiar yeast esters and faint hop flavor , then is quickly replaced by bitter red cherries and a medium chemical bitterness . the aftertaste is earthy , tart and bitter . i ca n't say i really care for this beer too much . the brewers were trying to not make a syrupy sweet beer , which often happens with the fruit beer style , and by adding hop bitterness , they only turned a syrupy beer bitter . it 's not well-balanced and does n't quite sit right . wierd metals , tannins , sourness , bitterness ... it all just turns out to be a mess .

0.60 0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90	finally having this again after drinking at dark lord day , thanks to a trade with claaark13 - it was amazing then , so let 's see how my memory holds up . . . yeah , it 's still pretty amazing . once you crack this bottle open , the room is instantly filled with that fresh hop aroma ( someone should make candles out of citra hops ) , and the pour just brings out more fruity hop notes . while the appearance is a little less than to be desired from a pale ale ( looks more like a dipa , honestly ) , the taste is so clean and crisp that you drink it so fast you can barely look at it . loads and loads of clean hop characters - pineapple , lemon , peach - all the usual suspects are there , with just a touch of bitterness . for pale ales , and ipa 's and dipa 's for that matter , i prefer the clean fruit over bitterness - if you 're looking for the opposite , this may not be for you . however , if you 're looking for an almost perfect , unique , and super clean american pale ale , look no further . bravo , three floyds , bravo !

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80	its been awhile since i went belgian even longer since i had a lambic beer for wich iam not a big fan but i decided on taking a chance on this pretty highly acclaimed on today and iam glad i did.first off what a pour into a tulip glass a a rosey color with a fluffy pink head that settles slowly into a creamy-like mass with globs of lace behind.a whole lot of stuff going on in the nose a little funk and iron to go along with the sour cherry and vanilla just alot to take in , the flavors are just so much rolled into one starts off big and nearly puckering sour but is stopped abruptly by a cedar wood dryness and iron/metallic note.a nice vanilla pod lends itself well as it melds nicely between the two extremes of this beer.this is a doozy and makes me think more about a style that i didnt care for much before but maybe i havent explored it enough , it might be my beer phase i go into exploring the fruit lambic style .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	12 oz bottle . beer pours a very nice hazy light amber color with a nice but not lingering white head . good start ! lacing is decent too . nose ... umm , i think i detect a hint of berry there ? ok , so it is big on sweet berries . and while i like berries , to me it is artificial-smelling . i grabbed a bacardi silver raz *shudder* out of my wife 's hand and confirmed that it smelled about the same . i detect some wheat in this too , but i simply do n't like this smell . taste ... i think this won because after the smell they were expecting it to be awful , which it is not . there is some good dry , wheat maltiness here , but to me it is too sweet . cloying by mid glass , i struggled to finish this and looked for something else to rid my palate of any memory of this . if this were a little less sweet , i 'd likely have no trouble finishing a bottle , and on the right hot day , perhaps two . not particularly fond of the expressive carbonation , and i think the spritzy fruity sweetness has masked some other flaws . i 'll keep the other bottle in the fridge until it is much warmer and give it another shot .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80 0.80	as an occasional hophead , i 'm glad the belgians brew an excellent ipa too , every now and then . urthel has a nice website . their labels are funny . orange golden clear colour , creamy head , absolutely great lacing , massive carbonation . simply great to look at . smell and taste are of hops , pine , and peppery spices . it has really a tough bitterness , next to malt and yeast . the alcohol comes somewhat through , in both the aroma and the flavour . the carbonation makes this a good beer even for a warm day , buti have to say : this is no easy beer . it 's demanding and strong . not for the fainthearted . i 'm hoping for more ipa 's from us on the european market , but for now i 'm perfectly happy with some of our own .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	pours with a giant , foamy , frothy , fluffy , white head and lots of lace . color is a clear yellow and some tiny bubble trails . aroma is beer and a hint of hop . flavor is mostly sweet with some floral notes and a little bitterness . body is a little watery and carbonation is good . finish is like flavor and short . not bad beer .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	quick notes from tigris beverage/g.housen tasting earlier today . 500ml brown glass pry-top bottle . super pale yellow with thin white head that falls quickly . nose is huge compared to the appearance : white smoke , rocks and gravel , and some barnyard funk . palate is crisp and dominated by pear notes ( like peary ) . tart and earthy . not a lot of wheat character . very clear and clean finish .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	`` coffee and love are best when they are hot . '' -- german proverb mahogany brown with reddish caramel edges and a thin slice of khaki colored foam that should have been bigger given the increasingly aggressive pour . the featureless head shrinks to a barely covering film in minutes and leaves no lace . the nose is exactly as expected for a coffee bean added porter . each sniff delivers a big blast of java , along with roasted malt and hints of vanilla bean . 'outstanding ' is the word that comes to mind ... and i 'm not even a coffee drinker . alta gracia coffee porter is damn good beer however you slice it . the brewers have done a bang-up job balancing the three major elements , allowing none of them to dominate on the palate . having it favor bitterness rather than sweetness was also a good call during the design stage . vanilla is ( almost ) lost in the shuffle . having those beans share the spotlight with the coffee beans might have made this stuff even better . warming brings more flavor intensity and even better flavor definition . muy drinkable . one source says the abv is 5.0 % . if true , then there 's plenty of barley to go around . that , in combination with well-done bubbles , leads to a light creaminess and a decent amount of cling . otter creek/wolaver 's is not one of my favorite breweries , though they do have their moments . alta gracia coffee porter is definitely one of their finer moments and is an offering that deserves to be released on a regular basis .

1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.80	ten fidy : another thanks to nightwing002 for the trade ! bod : 11/17/10 pours a rusted mahoghany and settles jet metal black . a fingers worth of burnt caramel head sits for a short while . the edges leave very little light to pass through . spotty lacing clings throughout . the nose brings a lot of milk chocolate that has a bittering end to it . roasted malts and a presence of alcohol are also noted . the taste is interesting . the roasty malts bloom but an annoying metallic taste lingers . there is a light hop presence . as it warms , the flavors intensify . the mouthfeel is very full bodied and sits like an anvil . creamy feel with good carbonation . overall , pretty good impy stout but that metal taste was a bit off-putting . i would like to try this fresh to see if there is a difference .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.40	i always try to hit wagner every year when i vacation up in the finger lakes , and finally decided to properly review a few of their offerings . first up was the signature dockside amber lager . poured the 12 oz . bottle into a pint glass . deep , deep amber color , somewhat cloudy , with good head retention and lacing . smelled pretty nice too , with some malt and floral kick to it . but the taste ... hmmm . what is this beer ? much fuller and maltier than i would 've expected from a lager , amber or otherwise , and not in a good way . i found the sweetness overpowering and cloying . there 's some hop bitterness in there somewhere , but overall i found the flavor profile a bit of a mess . mouthfeel , for what it 's worth , was fine , nice carbonation , but again , the sweetness made it a difficult call overall . it 's drinkable to a point , but i could only really handle just one . it 's a shame , because wagner does some awesome brews , especially the sled dog . and maybe i got a bad batch . but overall , i 'm not going with this one again .

0.50 0.20 0.40 0.40 0.30	wiseman zach brought this back from rochester , ny . thanks dude ! poured into a cigar city snifter . appearance : a white , fluffy , head sits atop a hazy goldenrod body . retention is really weak . no lacing . nothing special . smell : ew . smells like sweettarts or maybe pixie stix . the cherry is there , but it smells more like cherry-vanilla ( yogurt ) . sickly sweet . does n't show any semblance of saison . downright awful . taste : tart cherry and rum-like esters are the first things i get . lemon , clove , and hay are also in there , but the overall taste is very ho-hum . much better than the smell , but so far this beer reminds me of a phony pumpkin ale . lots of non-beer qualities to this beer , if you catch my drift . leaves a really crappy taste in my mouth . mouthfeel : moderately carbonated , malty , medium-bodied , and ... fuzzy ? not as creamy as i had hoped , and all of the off flavors are really ruining everything else for me , too . drinkability : boo . this was the lousiest saison i 've ever tasted , and i 've had quite a few . i was hoping for some sour notes from the cherries , but nope . this was all phony sweetness . yuck .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.70	wow ... got this beer the other day for a kickback because it 8.99 for a case . so of course we were n't expecting much . but i must say this is actually a pretty descent brew . and id pick this over most of the other cheap brews . it has a nice clean , taste of malts that are pretty sweet , with just a little bitterness on the end that last for just a little bit before it finishes cleans . the malt is balanced , not to ricey or too corny or none of that . crisp and refreshing with a light-medium body . still a little watery in taste though ... but hey , you know how that goes . its a good beer for what its meant to do , which is be cheap . next time you need a cheap beer , id highly recommend this one . you may be pleasantly surprised .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	big , complex , intense beer ! it pours gotham city dark with a big , creamy , fat head of mocha that has pretty decent retention for such a big beer . the head fades slowly into a thin , creamy film and leaves sticky thin walls of sea foam lacing . the aroma is intense , complex , intoxicating and inviting . rich , dark chocolates , roasted malt , notes of coffee , toffee , and caramel fade into a complex arrangement of dark fruit ; raisins , dates , figs , and overripe plums . notes of sweet tobacco with hints of vanilla oak with aa boozy phenol finish . again intense , rich , and complex . full of flavors and all are complimentary . follows the nose . bold cocoa , coffee , and rich dark chocolates . caramel and dark toffee melts into a bouquet of sweet tobacco and dark fruits ; chocolate covered black cherry , black currants , raisins , fig and plum . faint notes of vanilla . burnt sugar , licorice , and honey notes fade into a roasty , espresso finish with a big boozy bite at the end . earthy hops hide way back in the dark . big , rich , sticky , thick , chewy , smooth , intense , warming , velvety body . nice low carbonation and quite intense boozy burn finish . finish a bit too hot for me . bit big for me , but enjoyable . a definite slow sipper . complex , interesting , decadent and rich ! love the complimentary complex flavors that go from roasty , to dessert-like sweet , to dark fruit , to earthy , to hot . its the hot finish that cuts an otherwise smooth , lucious treat . intense and delicious , but a again ... a defnite , rich , sipper .

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90	sherry barrel-aged real ale real heavy , served at the draughthouse in a 4oz mini-snifter . pours a honey-amber hue with immaculate clarity and lots of depth to the body 's color . nice lace left behind on the glass from the scant sawdust head . a great aroma greets the nose , with soft cherry fruits and lots of toffee sweetness . a hint of floral & piny hops lingers in the background -- -very barleywine-line , which i enjoy . the flavor has the typical wee heavy malt profile boosted by a vinous barrel note . gummy , sour and sweet with a nice finish of yeasty tropical fruits and hoppiness . spicy with booze , but the 10 % abv is very well-hidden . mouthfeel is dry and a bit thin , while remaining low in carbonation . overall , a great special release from real ale , and probably one of their best beers i 've had to date . very excited for the rest of the mysterium verum series ...

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.50	was extremely tentative when trying this beer , being a fan of brown ales a little weary about the high alcohol content , but boy was i glad i tried this , probably one of the most complex brown ales that i have had so far , look for a full review at a later date

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	elnw entry # 19 : as before , while i know this is a california beer , i found this one in poulsbo , wa 12oz capped bottle a : dark near black brown with some reddish highlights throughout and golden brown rims . no head to speak of save four a few misty whisps floating atop the brew . n : chalky cocoa , shoeboxes , leather boots , wheat crackers , flourless dark chocolate cake , roasted malt , very slight alcohol and sherry notes . closety , boxy . p/m : causes me to grimace upon initial sip . second sip is better , but still a little out of balance : day old cold coffee , hippie grains , burnt rice scraped from the bottom of the pan , sourness , spoiled grains left in water , charcoal . very little harmony here . the label reads : `` store our fresh perishable product in a cool place . '' this did n't have much downtime between the central market and the fridge , so i have n't a clue if this is a factor or not . it do n't taste spoiled , it do n't taste off , it just taste out of tune ... gets better as it warms with some smoke factors coming into heavier play , but all the same this is one chalky stout . carbonation is strong and body is nice and full . why could n't the alaskan stout had this thickness ? damn ... notes : everything is right about this beer except for the taste . maybe it needs to age , or maybe something went wrong during the shipment , but something is just way out of balance here . being a guy who likes both gammel dansk and jagermeister , i do n't think my palate is the entire problem . might be something you need to try at the brewery for best effect owing to the organic bit ...

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	ah ... sierra nevada pale ale ... . i lost my craft brew virginity to this green labeled beauty . sampling this from a bottle . pours a crisp copper with a substantial 1 '' + head on a rough pour . lots of lacing . gradually reduces to just a thing bone white film . beautiful coloring . smell is mild and not tons of identity here . a bit of a metallic smell . hint of malt . nothing overpowering . taste is good . mild hops with good malt balance . fruit in the aftertaste . a pleasant taste , mild character . slightly bitter finish . mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth so easy to drink i could have this all day long . love it . the original . i do n't think i appreciate the hop character and bitterness as much as i used to when i was just a `` virgin '' . but for some reason this is not as distinctive as it used to be , but still a very good brew . like classic rock . you can do it over and over again and it is still great .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	12 oz bottle poured into a snifter - fridge temp - 2008 appearance : pours a clear brown color with an orange/red highlight . the head is white and is so short-lived i do n't know how tall it actually was . swirling makes some lace . smell : smells sweet with malt and almost an anise/licorice aroma . not sweet or hoppy . taste : a little bit of spice . some nutter flavors go well with the caramel malts . not much else . mouthfeel : medium bodied and lively with carbonation . this beer has no real noticeable alcohol . drinkability : pretty good . not the oktoberfest that i would reach for . maybe it could be the green bottle ...

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	thanks to paxton1978 for this one popped the cork that did not `` pop '' and poured pitch black with little head turning to film rather quickly . aromas of dark malty goodness , toasted coconut , roast nuts , fruit cake , anise , sweet spices and alcohol sweet tallahassee ! ! ! ( as my friend arty says ) it 's like a dessert in a glass . burnt sugars , brown sugar , chocolate , coconut , syrup , dark fruits , cake and then more sweetness . there is a bit of bitterness but it is no match for all the sweetness and throws the balance off completely . carbonation was lighter than expected which was not a bad thing but the body could have been much fuller and richer especially for what i expected from such a sweet decadent beer . i have really loved the ab series and am a brewdog fan . i had high expectations and was not impressed . well made and i love what they do but not this time so much .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	wow . she sure is pertyyy . i am under her spell . snifter pour and i am met with with a beautiful black ale with a major mocha foamy head which dissolves to a thin layer . the aroma is amazing . major chocolate aroma with a dose of roasted malts , vanilla , toffee and cocoa . i could smell this all day . hmmm . sort of a letdown on the taste . first off the drink is much too thin for what i thought would be big-bodied . coffee characteristics in the flavor with some smokiness and big roasted malt ! drinkability is good but the mouthfeel is very distracting to me . i was hoping for so much more and though this is a good beer , a little fuller body would make this beer top notch .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60	the beer poured into the glass crystal clear dark amber brown with a low off-white head which lasted well to lace the glass . the aroma was gingerbread spice and cinnamon spice with some light caramel maltiness . almost the aroma of allspice one finds in a pumpkin beer . the flavor was chocolate and caramel and ginger/allspice . the flavors were muddled and more akin to a brown ale with some spicing added . the chocolate and the spice just did not work very well together and the flavors collide in a battle that neither was well suited to win . some slight bittering also detracts in the flavor . the finish was dry , bone dry , with some chocolate and a slight coffee flavor coupled with low spice into the afteraste . the body was medium light and a bit watery . not a favorite , just to muddy in the flavor to be worthwhile . 22 ounce bottle . purchased in ga .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	a dark orange color beer that is very cloudy with a long lasting bubbly head . quite a citrus filled aroma with some cinnamon mixed in and some ginger . plent of citrus and spice . the alcohol is also present . not too much malt . medium to thick with a mild carbonation . not easy to drink , but great to sip . pretty good flavors .

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	this is an exceptional beer from the get go . from the 750ml corked bottle , to the pop of the cork itself it screams class . it pours a hazy golden-yellow with a thick , rich white head with some pretty impressive lacing . the head sticks around for a bit , too . the nose is hoppy , citrusy and spicy . some fruitiness there , too . the first sip is like a slap across the face with flavor . beautiful hops and malt with undertones of citrus and severe spice . it finishes smooth with a lingering bitterness and a dash of spice . truly a great beer . though i have n't tried any other saisons , i venture to guess this is a very good example of one .

1.00 0.70 1.00 1.00 0.90	bottled 06/15/09 pours black - now most stouts are dark brown - this one is black - with a big 2+ finger tan head that left lacing all over the glass smell - not that strong - chocolate oak some hops taste - by far one of the best stouts out there and the best yeti i have had - oak first then the wonderful chocolate malt and then the hops mouthfeel - a medium to heavy body that has perfect carbonation - creamy smooth drinkability is great - i just wish i i could find this beer closer to home and didnt have to drive 100+ miles to try it

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.60	a - foggy , grapefruit meat-colored body . quickly dissipating white head . looks pretty delicious . s - slightly sweet raspberry/grapefruit scent . smells bright and interesting . t - what a letdown . this beer is pretty damn boring . the raspberry flavor is very , very faint . there is some slight tartness on the back of the palate . that 's about it . light bodied but pretty boring . m - crisp start but the finish ends up being very watery . disappointing . o - this beer is incredibly misleading . it smells and looks great but it does n't deliver in any other areas . probably wo n't drink again .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	as i pour , a delicate hop smell fills the air . a : off white head on a golden body . the head is huge and taking it 's damn hell time shrinking , so this will be an ornate visual description . it 's in my sam adams perfect pint , poured the randy mosher big head method . the body has the slightest haze and little active carbonation . it 's also too light for me , suggests this dipa might not have the appropriate malt balance . we'lll see . successive pouts provide a well built , creamy head . i like it . s : never have i ever smelled such a grapefruit smell for me . this sets the standard for me . this reminds me of standing beneath the grapefruit tree in my brothers backyard in l.a. with broken fruit all around us . that , and my grandma 's kitchen when i was very young when she ate grapefruit every day . a more delicate smell -because the grapefruit is everywhere- gives me also just a hint of a piney smell . just a hint . t : first sip : the taste is not as strong as the smell . the grapefruit is much less defined for me , as is that pine at the end . i get just the slightest hints of a light malt going on , not the caramel i would want to complement those hops . there is a much more bitter feeling here , but not very strong . as this warms to just barely cool , i get a rather bitter , though somewhat grapefruit taste on the back of my tongue , almost in my throat . all in all , i just ca n't be impressed with this beer 's taste . m : smooth and creamy , without too much carbonation at all . it feels kinda heavy on the tongue , but not much more than i would expect . d : very , i suppose . but not really my style . the flavor does n't wow me enough for how far it is out of what i normally drink . but is does n't taste like the abv is it .

0.70 0.70 0.30 0.30 0.20	a : poured a very dark brown/black , definitely not the darkest stout ever . looks damned syrupy in the glass , almost no head , however what little head there is appears to be a dark brown . lacing is totally absent . this stuff looks scarey . s : smells nice actually . i get big whiff of balsamic vinegar right off the bat , probably just the sweet smells mixed with that high alcohol content . but behind that freight train of scent , i smell dark fruits like raisins , plum , figs and prunes . also noted a bit of a woody brandy-like presence . smells nice , but still a little intimidating . t : woah . what in god 's name is this ! ? it 's sickly sweet like too much aspertame in a perfectly good cup of coffee . i ca n't taste anything but balsamic vinegar and alcohol . this is an assault on my taste buds and my gag reflex . m : bitter aspertame overdose , that 's all i get . bitter-sickly-sweet and pretty horrifying ( to me ) . thick , syrupy and almost oily . i am literally gagging , and sipping lightly only seems to prolong the torture . d : i could see this being drinkable in a year ... better yet , 5 years . i could even see myself sipping on a tiny glass of this as it is . but this stuff either needs some aging or a price adjustment , because if it does n't get better after a few years , then that means all it has going for it is alcohol content . my reflexes are having a hard time accepting that this is in fact a beverage . notes : no disrespect to dfh , i love their other brews , and i 'm sure someone out there likes this stuff . however , i 'll be shelving my other bottle for a few years before i even think about it again . at least i can say i tried it .

0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	this beer pours a deep garnet orange with a stiff white head . this beer smell awesome ! ! ! cinimmon , apple , spice , wheat bread , oak , vanilla , tobacco ... mmm good . as i drink it , the problem is , what flavors match up with these aromas ? the beer has a great london/english fruity estery taste with christmas ale type flavors of nutmeg and cinimmon . i bet this would be a great mulled beer . i wish i had more than one of these to review beacuse its a really complex ale that i would like to clone . a very drinkable ale with a great nutty spicey fruity finish . thanks to mccaaina for this beer .

0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	the pour was golden yellow with absolutely no head and nothing left on the glass . there seemed to be a total lack of smell , save a slight hint of fruit . the taste , i 'm sorry , i have to rank behind budweiser . there was , to me , a total lack of taste . it bordered on carbonated water . but on the same lines , it was refreshing and had good mouthfeel . i wo n't be stocking this one for lawnmowing season , or any other season for that matter .

0.80 0.20 0.40 0.30 0.40	this is a very , very , very bad beer . on opening the can you get a whiff of fermentation by-products . the colour is an attractive deep amber and it 's sparklingly clear . the aroma is mostly of diacetyl , with a little caramel and possibly a slightly roastiness . dry finish . it is actually reasonably bitter , but has no hop aroma or flavour . possibly this is why people think it a sweet beer . avoid like the plague .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.70	12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass , no freshness date . a : pours a slightly hazy pale copper with a one inch foamy slightly yellowish white head that initially leaves some sticky looking lacing but after a few minutes the head completely disappears and all lacing disappears , though with some agitation a creamy quarter inch head can be brought back to life for a little while at least for a moment . s : strong piny medicinal hop kick , very strong and spicy floral aromas with a bit of grapefruit rind mixed in , there is also a lightly detectable sweet and grainy maltiness hiding in the wings here as well , very fresh smelling . t/mf : this is were i was a bit disappointed after such a nice nose . pretty damn astringent and medicinal hop kick in the teeth and localized on the tongue . pine is there but that medicinal taste is really kicking my ass here . it sort of covers up anything else that might be hiding here . the carbonation and hop bitterness are working well together but the taste they spread so effectively across my palate leaves something to be desiered . d : very nice and fresh and strong hop aroma but that is where the goodness ends for me . the hops are a bit out of balance and undermines everything else that might have been in this beer . still there are worse ipas out there than this one .

0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80	from a 22oz bomber into a shaker pint , prophecy is a macro larger colored clear yellow with a creamy , moderately thick head that leaves sticky lace . the arom is fairly dull , mostly grainy , a surprise since this a barrel aged trippel . it got sweeter as it warmed , but only moderately so . from the first sip , wow , there 's all that complexity i was expecting in the nose , predominantly a strong vanilla and bourbon taste , with some yeasty spice . smooth and strong , the finish is boozy and dry , but sweetens somewhat as it warms . i really dig the vanilla here , very nice , but a touch hot . wish i had another for the cellar to let that mellow , but i ca n't get it here and did n't bring an extra home . the mouthfeel is fantastic , light , creamy and luscious . this was very drinkable to me , a big complex beer that is tough to decipher . however , a few people i was with , some general beer enthusiasts but not geeks , some generic beer drinks , found it to be too much . too bad for them !

0.70 0.70 0.30 0.40 0.40	6oz bottle acquired in trade with jetsbeer . thanks for the opportunity . gold foiled cap . poured in a rapscallion glass , poured a totally still almost opaque root beer brown brew . aroma is boozy scotch , with oaky notes . almost scared to take a sip , maybe i 'm not worthy , but here goes ... taste is of leathery malts upfront , but quickly shouted down by tart dark fruitiness , and closes with a return to the leather albeit with some warming from the alcohol . mouthfeel is way thin , and i just could n't see trying this one again . it 's like the smokey malt flavors that i love in a scotch ale were taken out , and replaced by these other flavors that do n't really belong . not sure this is the barrel effect , or what , but not impressed .

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.40	poured into a tall pilsner glass and boom the head almost literally exploded out of the glass . it was n't like a did a vigorous pour or anything , there simply was this explosion of carbonation and massive head . i barely got a few ounces of beer in the glass before i had to stop pouring . i did like the appearance of this hazy light colored beer . the smell was unlike any other pilsner i 've ever had before . it has a musky almost soapy smell . it has none of the characteristic smells normally found in a beer of this style : not good . the taste is equally disappointing . i guess there is quite a bit of malted barley , but it 's not sweet or pleasant like a heavily malted beer can taste . it 's bitter without any floral hop tastes or aromas . the mouthfeel is brisk and decent . i got this as part of a beer mix-pack for costplus world markets . maybe this particular batch of the beer is flawed , maybe the beer is just flawed . i do n't want to waste my time finding out . there are much , much better domestic pilsner style beers to enjoy ( lagunitas , trumer pils ) .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.50 0.50	appearance - pours into a pilsner glass and shoots to about 5 or 6 fingers of head right away . as it recedes , what forms up is perhaps the palest beer i 've ever seen . if it were n't for some light haze , it might not have any color at all ! that 's not true , but it really is nearly transparent . the head pulls back and holds at less than a finger , leaving a thick but ragged cover . 4.0 aroma - very light yeast poking through a lemony grain . some nice depth to the yeast despite its restrained intensity , perhaps even a light funkiness . 4.0 taste - mild tart/citric up front , and an unmistakeable 'funky ' element . it 's not overbearing but it takes me in a different direction . the swallow is prickly with carbonation , dry and a bit lemony . some positive elements but i do n't really like it much . 2.5 mouthfeel - very zippy , clean , and refreshing . 3.5 drinkability - no , i ca n't see myself having this one again ; *maybe* i 'd try it again on tap . 2.5

1.00 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.40	shiner is one of those beers that common people love to love . they believe it 's higher class than a typical bud/coors/etc but really , it 's not so great . the appearance is about all it has going for it . it 's a deep , clear , saturated brown . the smell is lacking . have you ever smelled stale water ? the taste is bearable , but seems burnt . there 's almost a slight caramel hint , which would be okay . i did n't taste it when i sipped and looked for it again . the mouthfeel also leaves something to be desired . it 's far too light and water-like . it also has a cheap fizzle that comes out of nowhere and clashes with the thickness . overall , it 's yate .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.90 1.00	poured like the bottle says , with the last one-third or so swirled in the bottle before being poured into the glass . appearance - uninspiring and dull , cloudy orange ( it 's an unfiltered beer ) with a head that starts out relatively large but soon diminishes completely . smell - a wonderful yeast or dough or wheat smell dominates , with orange or another citrus fruit tagging along . absolute heaven for the nose . taste - light and crisp but not without complexity . irresistibly smooth finish , tastes much the way it smells although the wheat is less noticeable . it goes down almost too easy , and yet there is more than enough to keep the palate interested . overall - an excellent lighter-style beer , perfect for people just getting into beers but fine for the beer geek as well . i am prejudiced against wheat beers , in fact i ca n't remember any other wheats that i like nearly as much as this one . but love it i do . well worth trying .

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.70	thanks h+a ! ... smell needs major improvement ... heads abit low for my liking ... golden copper in colour ... hides the abv quite well ... lacing is very nice ... smooth and drinkable but lacks that special something to make it stand out ... 'jiminy jilikers ' ''

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	looks like a triple , tastes like a triple , smells like a tri ... . oh wait . after the pour reveals a nice , hazy , orange-ish colored beer with a medium-high amount of head , the first thing to do is put it to the nose -- and it certainly does smell like a triple . but man . aroma of spruce and tiger lillies . supremely floral . this is not the aroma of your average triple . this beer could be marketed as liquid potpourri , and i 'd be proud to buy a lame plug-in air freshener that smelled like this . certainly , all the qualities are there . tastes great too -- strong orange flavor mixed with a kind of candi sweet malt flavor . a tasty beer to be sure .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.50	this beer looks like motor oil . were it not for the slightest swirls of head , i 'd funnel this into my car engine . the specks of head presence actually last , spinning slowly around as the liquid sits . still , a foamier top would provide a more impressive production . the smell is purty raw-dog bourbon . i mean it is sweet , sweet alcohol . not sweet like sugared candy , but sweet like yeast-infested , alcoholic , sugar-laden slop . it 's like a fraternity house on a football saturday . it 's strong , sweet , and unrefined . the liquid 's more quaffable than its sight or smell might attest . as the snifter reaches my lips , i brace as if i 'm shooting a shotgun . initially , the sip is sugary soothing -- like a pixie-stick . even in this 2008 , the alcohol is still hot : as i focus on taste and close my mouth to feel it , ethanol singes my cheeks and escapes thru my nose . it 's an obnoxious beer but , by god , if it 's a bourbon stout you want , it 's a bourbon stout you get . instead of having bourbon influence , this beer is like an android : 1/2 beer , 1/2 bourbon . it tastes like an average stout with a bourbon shot poured in it . it 's a kentucky car bomb . the initial feel of every sip is a comforting layer of sweetness . as the sugar breaks down , however , you 're left with a brow-furrowing , bourbony blaze . even if served cold , this beer is hot . though extreme on these continuums , it 's actually well-balanced . the sequence , though , from milk stout to liquor shot , might be better reversed . drinkability is less than average . how many beers actually taste like liquor ? it 's a novelty brew , and a good one . i 'd like to keep one on hand to occasionally show the buddies . i know its aim is not everyday sessions , but it 's not a real pleasant-drinkin ' brew . it hits harder than 13 % ; in fact , it ai n't far off from the 40 % of its liquor counterpart . if you 're just lookin ' for a punch , perhaps you should consider the liquor approach .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	a - clear golden yellow with average ultra white head . moderate retention and good lacing . tons of little bubble rising up through the beer . s - wet straw ? has a funky aroma , almost skunky smelling . t - sweet and crisp . much better tasting than the aroma would lead you to expect . m/d - medium bodied and very crisp . excellent carbonation .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40	2009 it says on the bottle . the pop out of the cork was like a hot dog being thrown down a hallway . no pop , no head , poured like water , but a very dark black with some brown highlights . lacing around the edge of the glass like its got legs . got some bourbon , some heat smell , some roasty toasty dark choc o latte . first taste of mixed bourbon and hot chocolate , then a lingering bourbon aftertaste . that stinging feeling is not carbonation but alcohol . good beer on tap i can only imagine , for 12 bucks , buy something else . close , but no lumps ...

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.30 0.40	anyone who 's brewed with a kolsch yeast has undoubtedly noted the terrible smell given off during primary fermentation . only with aging at near-lagering temps and perhaps a finning agent or two can you get rid of that and let the more delicate notes shine . my impression of karnival kolsch was that it was rushed through production and filtered for clarity .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50	this beer is available at the 8th street grill in downtown minneapolis . they are trying to be a beer destination , with over 30 beers on tap , but that 's a topic for another review . although this site lists this as a winter warmer , the bar lists it as a belgian dubbel . although this tastes more like a belgian than a winter warmer , it 's claim to either style is weak ( just like the beer ) . served on tap , this pours a pleasing clear amber color . there is no smell to speak of . the taste has slight fruity overtones , with apple and pear predominating , but it tastes as if it was watered down . this is the classic macro attempt at a craft brew style . do n't make the taste too strong so as not to offend the point lager crowd . well , i 'm not buying it ( literally ) . the mouthfeel is weak and the drinkability is poor . whatever style this is supposed to be , it just does n't get it done .

0.60 0.80 0.20 0.70 0.60	presentation : 12.7 oz . corked and caged bottle poured into a tulip glass . bottle is labeled lotnr . a . presentation : pours a completely flat light pink . reminds me of falt cherry 7up . not really appealing at all . aroma : i get some light raspberries and sour lemon . a touch of oak but not a whole lot else . some nice complexity here . taste : some nice raspberries and acetic notes here . not overly sour at all , but a pretty nice balance of raspberry and sourness . not getting any oak here . i think the lack of carbonation really does n't let this beer pop for me . mouthfeel : completely flat , not even a hint of carbonation . by far the worst part of this beer . drinkability : i find this really easy to sip on and alsmost drink to easy with no carbonation and these light , balanced flavors . i took away points here for the price . overall , a really big disappointment for me . the carbonation really is the death knell . not a bad beer otherwise , but something i 'll avoid at this pricetag .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	a- medium golden . head is one and a half finger white head and lasts well . minimal lacing . s- aroma is a sweet aduncty lager . pretty strong aroma though . t- it 's sweet up front . there is a bit of a vegetal nature , and a bit of apple in the finish . m- sits more firm on the tongue than i expected . a bit of lingering sweetness . medium carb . o- it exceeded expectations . it 's an above average pale lager , but it 's not a particularly great beer .

0.30 0.80 0.60 0.20 0.30	this beer is not retired , i just bought it . nice dark body , tan colored head with medium-sized bubbles showing good carbonation . a bit soapy looking later on . nice roasted malt initial flavor and aroma , but then it tastes a burnt on the back end . yes , burnt , they did n't just roast , they turned the malts almost into charcoal . i ca n't say i really like this burnt aftertaste . it is too bad , because it could otherwise potentially be a very nice beer . the burnt flavor overpowers the hops , so i ca n't say anything about them .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	this beer is dark . nothing new here . the smell is great . as a chocolate lover , i really like this . smells like straight up melted chocolate . and now i know why people say it tastes like chocolate syrup , because it kinda does . but i like it . if you 're going to do a chocolate stout , do a chocolate stout ! southern tier did . i forgot this was a beer for minute . do i want to finish this entire bomber myself ? no . but this is really good if you like chocolate . probably 1200 calories in this bottle . but who 's drinking beer and watching calories ? i 've been wanting to try this for a while and i 'm glad i did . next time i will pair it with some raspberries or strawberries , or make a damn milkshake out of it . i bet this would make a great stout cake . like chocolate ? try this .

0.90 0.70 0.90 1.00 0.80	bells special double cream stout : a vigorous pour leaves a good-sized head , with very nice staying power . the head is tan , and very creamy . the beer is absolutely black , and not a trace can penetrate the brew . the aroma is very mild , in fact , a deep sniff reveals little but a trace of chocolate milk . whats immediately notable is the fact that this is a smooth a beer as ive had in my life , im guessing the cream refers to the mouth feel of the beer , its more like a milkshake than a beer . the taste is very nice , needless to say very malty , but very well balanced , and it bears repeating , exceptionally smooth . the flavors here run the gamut of malts : chocolate , espresso , rye bread , and a bit of toast , with a pleasant taste of buttered rum . the hop flavor is subdued , but rises to the task to help clear the palate toward the end . this is really terrific .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.40 0.40	this is not a beer for me . disappointed , as i am an avid stone fan and this being my first opportunity with the levitation ale . while the prose was sweet as ever , the brew itself was exceedingly oppressive , strongly hopped -- i would hands down prefer ruination to levitation when it comes to high hops from stone . a pleasingly aesthetic amber red in a glass , this one just did n't have it in flavor to warrant another buy from me anytime soon .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40	poured a cloudy yellow , orange with a medium white head and no lacing . huge fruity nose with lots of pineapple . tasted pretty flat which makes me think i may have gotten a bad bottle . had more of a wheat beer feel to it than and definitely not an american pale ale . pretty sour which also makes me think it may have been a bad bottle . hugely disappointing considering how much i had heard about hair of the dog .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	dark amber and very clear . head does n't really leave lacing . smells like oak , vanilla , rum , chocolate , caramel and other malt notes . a lot of wood up front , very sweet malt beneath and a strong rum and vanilla character in the finish . leaves lingering rum/vanilla flavors on the palate . a bit watery . sweet , but never quite too sweet . i like the barrel flavors here ; interesting to see a rum-barrel beer . mouthfeel is light-medium and less than expected . this one is a unique beer and rather tasty , if a bit sweet and one-dimensional . i wish there was more malt complexity in the flavor . but it 's got to be one of the better beers you 'll find in a clear bottle .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	on tap at victory on 8/12/08 . a - highly carbonated light copper body with one-finger bubbly off-white head that quickly diminished and left spotty lacing . s - this brew primarily has a fruity nose with hints of apple and grape , along with a bit of spice , mild hops and sweet caramel malt . aroma is a little muted due to the cold serving temperaure . t - fruity , sweet , spicy , hoppy . lots going on with the flavor profile and all working quite well together . the caramel malt pulls everything together with an ever-present sweet base . hops emerge in the finish with a grassy and spicy character . m - medium body with moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy texture . dry finish with a crisp , fruity sweetness and a bit of hop bitterness . d - i was surprised to see a steam beer on the menu at victory . their take on the california common is solid with lots of flavors gelling together and producing a very tasty brew that is highly drinkable .

1.00 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60	this beer pours a brilliant brown amber with a sandy off-white film that left some nice lace behind . this is truly an attractive beer . smells of dry , sour grain , ash and feet ? there 's also a sweet and easy doughy malt followed by a crisp woody hop . tastes of thin molasses with a touch of lime rind followed by a dry touch of coffee . there 's also a thin tomato juice . why do alts tend to taste like vegetables ? felt a bit watery but slightly thicker than water with a light , almost forgotten carbonation . i have n't had too many of the style , but this was n't my favorite .

0.70 1.00 0.50 0.60 0.50	1pint .9 oz brown bottle . glass is stamped 0.5l it pours out all fizzy , a deep chestnut brown color . but very little head . big sweet malty aroma . caramel , candied walnuts , raisins . as expected , the taste is all malts , no trace of hops . sweet brown sugar taste . by the bottom of the glass , its a bit cloying . oddly , even though tiny bubbles stream to the surface , it does n't taste that way on the tongue , instead more flat . thick , coats the mouth . while there is no indication of the 9 % abv , it is too sweet to have good drinkability .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90	bottle 30/50 ... big thanks to casey for this ... dark brown body with not much carbonation ... the nose is outstanding , so much is going on , super strong notes of maple and roasted coffee , they play perfectly off each other ... the taste is more refined than the nose , simply outstanding melding of maple and coffee , a bit of molasses , the maple is so sweet but the roasted bitterness of the coffee balances ... i could drink about a half bottle of this , but would get too sweet after awhile ... worth trying

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	pours a dark copper amber color with lots of head that dissipates very quickly . nose is a bit off , smells funky in a bad way . lots of carbonation with this beer . the taste is pretty standard lager with some malty complexity you do n't get with large production american lager beers . one thing i 'll say is this beer is very drinkable , i would n't hesitate to take this to tailgate . the finish is clean and helps make this a better than average lager .

0.50 0.90 0.40 0.80 0.80	my 1st growler very generously sent by miketd . thanks man ! this beer smelled like heaven upon opening the growler . big , bold aromatic amarillo hops billowing out . pour is gold , with no head , as it seems to have lost carbonation in transit , unfortunately . almost reminded me of a fresh hopped beer with a nicely spicy tasting hop presence that was big in flavor , but not overly bittered . very drinkable and i can see this being fantastic properly carbonated . great ipa .

0.90 0.60 0.90 1.00 0.90	this should be given to anyone who thinks that all stouts taste like guinness . black in color with a thin tan head . i found little to know aroma at all . this is it 's only downfall . the taste though , is fantastic . it 's a very robust molasses like taste that lingers on my tongue for quite some time . the mouthfeel is very thick and it goes down smooth . certaintly one of the best examples of the style .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.60	22 oz . bottle , `` jul2511 '' screened on the neck . pale straw gold , bright and clear . a finger of white foam audibly fizzles down to a skim , leaving some spotty lace in the mug . there 's a feeble skim across the surface that lasts for a little bit . metallic wet grain , corn sweetness , sulfurous malaise . bland and hollow , sweet corn flavor with club soda carbonation . dry aftertaste , thankfully not overly sweet as some malt liquors can be . papery , dry , wet grain husks and manila folders . not overly carbonated , somewhat fizzy , designed for chugging basically . some light astringency is there , but it finishes clean , which is somehow impressive in some small way . a safe budget buy , i 've encountered much worse in this realm . `` ... as i rewind my thoughts and reminisce , sippin ' oe quarts ...

0.40 0.80 0.20 0.40 0.40	enjoyed at tonight 's nova tasting . bottle 57/1188 a : pours like an under carbonated old ale , absolutely no head . nothing , no pop of the bottle , no head at all . s : the smell is nice . whiskey , booze , malts , molasses , really deep and balanced . t : wow this is not great . tastes like a watered down whiskey . a malt character , but the barleywine base is gone . disappointing . mf : flat , stale , boozy , bad . o : huge disappointment . wish i could have had this a bit younger , hope my ba yeti does n't do this .

0.70 0.20 0.60 0.70 0.80	what ? captain morgan 's and porter in a cask , hand pump ? got ta try it . pours a glossy black , brown . no head , well maybe a bit . smells ... holy cow ! alcohol ... rubbing alcohol and dark chocolate . nasty . my god , this is gon na burn . surprise . no burn at all . alcohol is gone . wtf ? very smooth . hints of chocolate and slight rum . wtf ? this is a weird beer . feels like water . very smooth again . i 'm confused . not sure how to suggest this brew . try it if you can , but it only stands out for its awkwardness .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70	i love beer trading . ten fidy in chicago . a- unbelievalbe . thicker than gi bcs . i mean this stuff is almost like chocolate fondue . should almost get a perfect 5 . no head whatsoever . beer is so dark that remnants even add a tint to the glass . but enough about the longest appearance review ... let 's get on with it . s- wow . i do n't like this . a little chocolate but what get 's me is this overwhelming tootsie roll factory smell . overpowering . different but not good . t- not as bad as the smell . pretty well balanced more a ris at 10 % . dark chocolate and bit of coffee . not much alc . considering . m- really thick . maybe thickest beer i 've had . d- yeah , , , really not bad . typically high alc . make drinkability a negative for me . this one as said is balanced but this beer is just so much that i do n't see drinking more than one .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	poured into a duvel tulip a : when first opening it let out a loud carbonation release , however no foam came out of the bottle . when pouring it had way over 5 fingers of head . it foamed up real fast . once i got past all the head on this , i noticed the beer was a semi dark golden yellow with some haze to it . s : aromas of piney hops , almost like an ipa . malts show up towards the end of a big sniff of the beer . t : very light taste some citrus , and again some of that nice hop in the aftertaste with a heavy dose of malt . m : very carbonated , but does n't bite the back of your throat . the hop linger more then the malt . o : this is a perfect summer beer in my opinion , very refreshing and light , not overpowering at all . i think this would be a nice beer to go along with a pizza .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	a richly carbonated head with tremendous lace retention . color is a very clean copper . i am actually very turned off by the smell of this beer . smells of rotting food ? upfront with a hoppy malt aroma . so this beer seems somewhat watery and unrefined . it does have a abundant hop structure , with the expected grapefruit and citrus flavors prevelant . but everything just seem slightly discombobulated . well after about 20 mins this beer seems to open up somewhat . pulling itself together . and become much more drinkable and appreciative . the mouthfeel is pretty much described in the previous paragraph . meaning it 's not an overly drinkable beer but after some breathing time makes great progress . one or two and move on . i had this on draught against 90 minute ipa with randall the enamel animal at bw3 indy a few days ago and this beer held it 's own . totally different draught and spectacular . unfortunately i did n't take notes on that one . would have scored mid fours draught .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	a clear golden yellow . pours a nice white head with ok retention and lace . s soft honey . grassy tarragon bitterness . light bready note . overall the nose is pleasant , but restrained . t unusual profile . opens with a bright citrus-hop character laced of grapefruit pith , and then drives into dry earthy notes of grass and dusty pine . m medium / light body with a lingering dusty , woody bitterness .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	it 's been a while since i 've reviewed , and i wanted to get the ball rolling with the right equipment . the ten dollar , 12oz bottle at the beerstore was an obvious choice . probably the most expensive beer i have ever bought at retail by volume . but hey , still cheaper than moderately priced wine ! used a tulip glass for this special occasion beer . pours a dark ruby-mulch color . exceptional head retention , leaves a paper-thin sheet of head on the side of the glass . smell is very focused and potent , sweet , toasty , and chocolaty . the smell is strong enough smell to sample without bringing to my nose . definitely a sipping beer . obviously , alcohol taste is dominant , as is the malt profile . tingly and warming , this beer is not unlike brandy . though a very occasional smoker , this is probably the number one beer i would pick to pair with a cigar . i could n't drink this everyday , as it would kick my ass , but a definite must-sample for any beer lover .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	poured from a bottle into a large tulip pours a medium amber with a thin head that recedes to a cap . aroma is of ... dog food ? seriously that is the first smell i get . the smell is mealy and grainy with a sweet backing that reminds me of dry alpo . not in a bad way that is just the way the grain smells . not much for hops . flavor is deep roasted grain that is sweet like , well sugar . turbinado and dark brown sugar flavors permeate , with a slightly burnt character . the caramel and molasses flavor is powerful , but the bitterness of the roast balances . i use muscovado sugar a lot in my cooking and this beer reminds me of that . hops come in for an appearance on the finish . the hops are bittering to the tongue and almost numbing . alcohol is very well hidden here , if i did n't know abv was this high i would never guess . the yeast gives a slightly fruity almost raisiney flavor that sticks to the tongue . feels very nice on the tongue , smooth and lush with a good level of carbonation . very easy to drink with this abv .

0.30 0.30 0.40 0.50 1.00	after some glasses of pinot noir at a wedding reception , i opted for a moosehead lager but something about its combo of sweetness/skunkiness did n't fit the bill at that moment with the dance floor heating up . in fact , though it was about 40 degrees f outside , the heated cottage where the reception was held was quite steamy so it was the closest i 've come to that hot summer day in some time . because i was dancing at the time , i sampled this beer from the bottle rather than pouring it into a fluted champagne glass ( though they were available ) . i did receive a lime wedge and when i had a hand free i like to suck on the lime before sipping the beer . there is nothing noteworthy about the appearance or smell of this cerveza . as often described , it has a straw-urine color and i 'm not sure there would be any head or much lacing to speak of had i poured it . tastewise though corona is different than your basic mass-market lager . it is smooth , with some skunkiness but in a way that is pleasant when enjoying the beer as refreshment . the taste is not one that lingers on the tongue or palate , mouthfeel correspondingly suffers . the addition of the lime wedge , over time , provides the illusion of a citrus aspect to the beer that i enjoy because i 'm drinking the beer as it is intended , the same way one might savor bleu cheese with a glass of port . a previous reviewer commented on the sexiness of the beer , and i think this is a strong suit though not a typical rating factor here on ba . with the heat of the dance floor , the fizziness of the setzery beer , and the tartness of the lime , this bottle was enjoyable and i would rate the drinkability above a five if possible . goes down easy , begs for more , clearly and cleanly refreshing .

0.60 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.70	i do n't know what to think of this beer . it 's not a blonde for sure . an amber ? nah . no idea . the pour is golden , more orange than yellow and a nice head , for a short while . no lacing , i 'm hesitant to score it a 3 ... could be lower . no aroma . no `` 1 '' score b/c it is n't awful , but there 's nothing really . perhaps some very very weak orange peel . pale malt ? taste is flat , but not horrible . it 's easy drinking b/c it lacks flavor and complexity . what is this thing ? it 's like water , a bit thicker . nothing else . weird .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	a : pours a deep black with a dark tan head . very little in the way of a head and this beer is quite viscous judging by the pour . daddy likes . s : a touch of alcohol , a touch of chocolate , some roast malts , a little sweetness with a hint of vanilla . things are looking good , very good t : a little bland at the front but it builds slowly with some nice coffee and chocolate flavors . plenty of roast malt flavor to go around with a lingering slightly aftertaste . it takes awhile for this beer to gain flavor but when it does it 's great . m : a touch watery with light carbonation and although a touch watery at the front it finishes slightly chewy . d : this is a sipper and due to being a stout it is n't exactly sessionable but finishing off this bottle wo n't be a problem o : a solid offering from the folks at bell 's . if it had a bit more flavor at the front end it would be a home run .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.90 0.80	dogfish head , raison d'etre , draft , 7.5abv . a4 , s2.5 , t4.5 , m3.5 , o4 a a nice clear brown color . absolutely no head at all . there was just a hint of head around the edge of the glass . came in a frosted thick goblet ; probably too cold for this beer . s there was hardly any aroma on this beer aside from a very faint raisiny sweet note . t sweet , raisins , a litle peppery . complex , clean , no big lingering aftertaste . there is a sweetness at first , but it fades quickly . i am not able to detect any distinct hop flavor . this beer is well balanced . it is really hard for me to pick out individual flavors . m it appears as though it would be heavier , but is medium body and is thined by the relatively high 7.5abv . there is a little warming , but not very noticeable . it is a little sticky , so there must be some unfermented sugar left . o tastes a lot like belgian darks that i have had , although sweeter . a complex brew that changes as it warms toward the end of the glass . recommend .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	appearance- fluffy , off-white , head . tiny fine bubbles , good lacing . color is outrageously pretty , deep amber hue . this beer gives you a great looking glass ... smell- ... and a great smell ! incredible smell , might be the best smelling ipa i 've had so far . really nice batch . smells like a field of flowers and with its distinct flowery smell that might remind some of opening a pot of honey . taste- really shines here too . tastes like honey and has great citrusy/pine character from the hops . reminded me a bit of spruce beer without the sugar a little . both flavors take on their own distinct part in the overall taste of the beer . at first you get a blast from the flowery/sweet hint of the hops and then it booms back with nice long lasting bitterness . mouthfeel- nothing spectacular here . all the right notes are there but it lacks the umph this beer has in all other categories . long lasting taste , pretty good coating . overall- great year for this beers first year . they were exceptionally lucky this year it seems . the taste and smell really shine .

1.00 0.70 0.80 1.00 1.00	bomber i received in trade a few months ago ( thx tprokop7 ! ) and have cellared since . poured into an impy pint , cadillac mtn . stout is a dark blackish brown with a very foamy , nitro like body that quickly settled to a massive , creamy tan head that 's tight and rocky settling and leaves nice and heavy sheets of foamy lace . how they pulled that off without a widget i 'll never know , but sure am impressed ! ! ! smell is spicy , herbal hops and chocolate malt , very light , clean alcohol vapors . not bad , but underwhelming compared to the rest of this awesome beer , which was served at ~55f . taste is a fantastically tasty balance of roasted and chocolate malts , ( english ? ) hops , with just a hint of heat on the finish . a touch acrid , a touch sweet , a touch bitter , a touch herbal , and all around awesome . i really ca n't think of anything else i could ask for from an american stout , wow . mouthfeel is oily and crisply carbonated , with a dry finish , but really rather smooth overall , medium-light bodied . drinkability is the tits . wow , super impressed , yummy ! ! ! ! this went down like apple pie , and if i had more bombers , i 'd probably drink them the rest of the night . while we got some great locals , this one is right up there with the best in class , no doubt !

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.80 0.60	drank from an 8.5 fl . oz . bottle 2004 vintage , no . 74266 poured a cloudy , crimson-amber with absolutely no head . smell was intense and unpleasant . soy sauce was most apparent followed by burnt sugar and a woody , oaky aroma . taste was rich and somewhat brandy-like . prunes , raisins and dried fruits along with some caramel sweetness were noticeable . the beer had a big alcohol punch which was nicely offset by the hearty flavors and aromas . the mouthfeel was syrupy and rich with only a minuscule amount of carbonation . at 11.9 % abv , this beer was definitely more drinkable than expected . nevertheless , this is definitely a sipping beer , perfect for savoring on a cold winter night .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	pours clear , amber/orange in color . copious amount of head , over 1 '' . not a lot of smell coming off of this one . it smells sweet , with pine and citrus coming through . quite sweet , at first , then piney bitterness comes through . the taste does n't go away . it stays on the palate for a very long time . great balance . light carbonation , not syrupy like some sweeter dipa 's tend to be . the mouthfeel is much thiner than i would expect from the taste . the warming of the alcohol is present . i really enjoy this beer . it has a great hop sweetness balance . i do n't mind the alcohol feel so much , the sweetness is not overdone to cover it up .

0.50 0.40 0.80 0.80 1.00	thanks to jesse13713 for this beer , got it in a trade with him - great box jesse . pours a reddish orange , with a jewel like clarity and translucence . head is one and a half fingers , dissipates quickly , and leaves not much lace . good looking body , pathetic looking top . has a weak toasted aroma with a tinge of metallic character . trying to get some more scents , but the smell really is quite weak . taste is better , as toasted biscuits come out . flavored a bit like a snickerdoodle or sugar cookie with some bubblegum character as well . slight sweetness throughout makes this a very pleasant drink . there is some spice here and there , cinnamon being the one that strikes me . graham cracker also makes an appearance . mouthfeel is crisp and clean , and neither sticky nor dry . a bit watery , but it works for the style and beer in this case . drinkability is where this beer makes a name for itself , as the sweetness is perfectly leveled to keep the beer going down easy swig after swig . flavors go well together and the beer just works . was shocked to see this one is 6.5 % abv , as it goes down ridiculously easy.this is a case of a beer being more than the sum of its parts .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	appearence : pours a light cabronation-filled copper with a thin , decently lasting but zero lacing white head . smell : the smell is a wonderful mix of rich malts and strong , powerfully complex hops that are almost perfectly balanced . perhaps this flying dog may stand the test ... taste and mouthfeel : the taste is not as good as expected , but still not bad . the hops are strong , flavorful , and have hints of citrus and almost an earthy feel to them . the malts are almost non-existent , and the aftertaste is that typical yeasty taste that flying dog tends to have problems with ( or they want it that way ) . the mouthfeel is thin . drinkability and overall : this beer is just a tiny bit above the average ipa , but definitly nothing too seek out . while it 's gorgeous boquet promises greatness , the rest is lacking anything special ? would i have another ? yes . would i enjoy it ? doubt it .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	a - poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter . dark brown , almost black . nice tan head and lacing . s - its a camp fire and smores in a bottle ! smells amazing ! t - not too much smoke , bet definitely present . a little bit of cocoa . nice bitter finish . m - low carbonation and a medium body . its creamy with a slight chewiness . soft and great . d - i have n't had many smoked beers , but this one is definitely at the top of the list . the taste does n't quite match the deliciousness of the smell , but it still tastes great . perfect on a cold cold night , watching a movie , and a fire blazing .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.20 0.20	double ipa brewed with lemon and orange zest . $ 14.99 for a 6 pack . thin layer of yeast in the bottom of the bottle . pours out to a cloudy burnt orange , forming a decent sized poofy light yellow head with good retention and nice sheets of lace . the carbonation is mild to moderate . the aroma is of grapefruit and mango from the hops , with more mango when swirled . not picking up any lemon or orange . the mouthfeel is rich , without being syrupy , with a medium dense body . the taste opens up , all too briefly , with the mango , then is replaced by a huge grapefruit pith bitterness . way too bitter for my taste , as it burns all the way through the finish and you are left with an extremely bitter aftertaste . very high alpha 's here . youch . any subtleties of malt and hops are lost in this brew . 1/3 of a bottle is enough for me . i wo n't be buying this again . i do n't think i could even give this one away . one of the worst , if not the worst double ipa i 've ever had . i love ya joe , but i ca n't drink this one . sorry .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	pours more translucent than most stouts ; light passes through at the bottom and sides of the glass . head immediately fizzes down to nothing . aroma is a decadent mocha and milk chocolate , but the taste does n't quite live up to it . rich chocolate and coffee tones lead the way , with an almost hershey 's sweetness . drys slightly in the finish , with roasted malt making an appearance . this would be worthy of a 4 if not for the metallic , almost canned background flavor .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	appearance : dark brown with no light coming through and a creamy tan head made up of unevenly sized bubbles . smell : oddly this beer has no aroma , nothing . it 's rather scary , but i had my nose way down into this beer and i could n't smell anything . taste : roasty opening with a lingering coffee flavor . the beer is watery and thins as the flavor progresses . some astringency and a bit of fake cherry flavor ( like cough medicine cherry ) . mouthfeel : soda-like carbonation in the mouth . very lively . clean on the palate without any residual uncomfortable feel . slightly dry . drinkability : it 's not offensive but i think it lacks a lot of flavor and leaves a lot ot be desired .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	pours with a one-fingered white head that fades quickly and leaves hardly lace . cloudy amber color . i agree with todd - the nose is musty and metallic - unusual for any beer . light - medium carbonation . starts sweet but thin bodied , finishes smooth . $ 2.99 for a 500ml bottle .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.50	pours an orangey golden colour . head is huge and frothy . sudsy lacing . boisterous bubbling . very vibrant and alive , which is what you want in a saison . looks pretty interesting . nose is big and funky , with huge citrus characters , and a really nice almost smoky malt character on the back . something solid and very grounded connect with the light and airy saison characteristics . bit of pepper coming through as well . it has some really pleasant saison characters . perhaps not as well integrated as some of the best examples , but the malt character grounds it nicely . taste is unfortunately quite thin , and rather insipid . some spice on the front , with a lingering acerbic bitterness and a touch of acidity throughout . but there 's no depth to it , no connection with the malt as in the nose - indeed , there 's little body or malt on it whatsoever . just a woody acidity , some funk and a green organic character on the back . and that bitterness , which does n't really match with anything else . no , it does n't work for me . oh , no . the bruery has done it again for me . every time i 'm expecting something big , exciting and robust , and there 's always an insipidness to their beers . it 's happened every time so far , and i 'm wondering how long i can continue to stick it out .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.80 0.60	light gold color with no head . does n't look too special . aroma is ok , has that `` european '' smell . light carbonation . upon tasting you realize that this is not your typical european lager . starts somewhat sweet , then some heat from the alcohol kicks in . from there , i get a long lasting flavor that eventually fades to a moderate bitterness on the back of my tongue . very smooth . yum ! well done stong pale doppelbock . i usually prefer dunkel bocks , but this beer is quite good .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	this bock pours dark brown with some reddish hues . a big fluffy head reduces at a fair rate to a crown which leaves nice lacing . a hoppy nose greets me . some pine there too . initially the flavor is smooth , sweet malt . before the sweetness becomes too much , some piney hoppyness comes forth to balance things out . crisp from the high carbanation . an slightly oily and astringent finsh invites the next mouthful . a nice bock . the alcohol is hidden well , so watch out . nicely balanced . my first `` sixer '' of optimator was a good experience . i 'll be buying this again .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	bottle 151 of 336 . poured into a tulip . this pours jet black with a thin layer of dark mocha head . it settles quickly leaving some thick lace . the aroma is jam packed full of rich bourbon right up front . hints of chocolate and licorice in the background with dark fruits . the pallet has a nice chocolate flavor to it with some vanilla notes . a little bit of a dark cherry flavor rounding it out with good roasted malts throughout the drink . the body is a little lighter than i would prefer and the carbonation could be toned down a bit . but it does n't ruin the end result . overall a nice treat here . i look forward to new beers from these guys .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.80 0.70	this beer ... is `` americas largest selling ale '' , which has become sort of a joke amongst my circle of friends ... something about the vagueness of `` largest '' does n't say much ... best selling ? largest selling container ? largest volume produced ? probably more of the latter , but still ... this is my go-to beer when i 'm reaching for an ice-cold 40 ... they 're cheap at the local bodega ( about $ 2.50 for a 40 or a dollar or two for the smaller cans ) and pleasantly skunky enough to please your average `` ale '' lover 's palate , especially if you 're just looking for something tasty , cold , cheap and readily available on a hot summer day . i 've drunk this beer hundreds of times , starting back when i was always broke , but now that i can afford better beer , i still get it from time to time . note : its better in cans , for some reason . i know people say this sort of hting about lots of beers , but this one is very noticeably different in cans . more bitter , more fresh , as close to `` ale '' as this beer gets ... try both , see which you like .

0.50 0.70 0.40 0.30 0.30	thanks , bendurgin , for sharing ! poured into a tulip . during the pour this fizzes like cola ; the head disappears immediately . the first whiff is all peanut butter . there is some malt sweetness detected the more time my nose spends in here , but this is mostly peanut butter . the taste is a muddled delivery of sweet malt and peanut . this is for the most part alright , but the aftertaste is where the real horror begins . there is a vegetal flavor throughout and there is n't much bitterness to offset the sweetness . this is kind of light for a stout with sharp instead of smooth carbonation . not good .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.50 0.40	i 've recently developed a taste for hoppy beers . this beer proves to me that it is not that i did not like hoppy beers in the past , i just did n't very bitter beers . a : nice brown ale with decent light tan head . s : smells of sweet floral hops . very nice . t : sugar sweet ( touch of brown sugar ) along with some malt sweetness . light alchole flavors present as wel . very bitter . not so much hop flavor , just a lot of bitterness . very minimal belgian fruitiness . m : full body with light creaminess which , in my opinion , was cancelled out by the bitterness . d : once finished , i was ready to move on to something new . this beer did n't do it for me . it kind of reminded me of the santa 's private reserve , but not as flavorful . too bitter .

0.40 0.80 0.60 0.70 0.60	pour : 11.2oz bottle to wide mouth glass . cloudy dull brown body w/ absolutely no head . bottle opened w/ a hiss but nothing like that in view in the glass . nose : mulled apple cider . sweet and fruity . malty , caramel , honey . mouth : somewhat fizzy , minty , malty , cider-y ... a touch of roasty , brown malts . warm alcohol heat . enjoyable but perhaps a bit past its prime .

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	a big pale ale for a lover of big beers . if you like west coast ipas , you 'll like this one . very hoppy , yet with a well-balanced flavor . from a can , poured into pint glass . appearance- a nice amber-orange . not much of a head , but somehow carbonation lingers in aftertaste . smell- a pleasant combination of alcohol and hops with a little malt . somehow , it punches you in the nose every time you come back to smell again . you do n't adapt to it . that 's what i like most about it . taste- delicious representation of the smell . strong hops up front , especially for a pale ale , then dry malt . i get some lemon lingering afterwards . want one more note ( some sweetness ? ) , but great . mouthfeel- the malt/lemon sits on the tongue nicely . `` carbonation '' stays too . something about the aftertaste feels like bubbles on your tongue . i find it very drinkable and pleasant , with the taste complexity of a sipping beer and a lack of heaviness so that you could have more than one . excellent deliciousness .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	poured from a bottle to a gass stein . it had an orangish-copper color with a bubbly white head that became a thin lace . the carbonation began as medium but quickly became low to moderate . there was not much of a smell . it was n't bad , but very faint . the taste was a bit spicy , quite hoppy , especially for this type ( though i do realize that it can very quite a bit . ) although it was a bit watery , it left a dry hoppy taste . i 've had better , and i 've had worse . not bad , but nothing exceptional either .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.50	poured into a sam smiths pints glass from a 12oz . bottle . appearance - a see through copper color with a small head of about half a finger . smell - nothing great . some tart hops , and little else . smells more malty than anything else taste and mouthfeel - pretty bland . nothing at all to jump out and grab your tongue . mouthfeel is smooth with the malt , and theres a hoppy bite fluttering around in there somewhere . sweet caramel , and some orange in the taste . hoppy crispness in the end fades fast leaving the mouth dry . drinkability - more a pale ale than an ipa . a great brewery , but a sub par offering . nothing grabbed me about this beer at all .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90	2009 bottle poured into a pint-tulip hybrid . from last nights notes . dense and dark copper body with a very large tan head composed of loose soapy bubbles . the head takes a little time fading but eventually goes away almost completely . big on the aromatics ! the carmel and sweet bread maltiness is backed up by big bitter and citrus hops . perceptible alcohol is offset by a great earthy wood character . perfect for the style . flavor brings on even more fruity ( apples mostly ) malt and alcohol sweetness but it 's held in check by the equally healthy dose of hopping . hops seem more bitter and leafy and less citrus than the aroma . oak is even more present here . this one is slightly `` hot '' on the palate but not too much for the style . carbonation is very low , near flat actually . i 'm not one of those who think every beer should have soda-like effervescence , especially on barley wines , but i have to admit i 'm missing it here . just a slight carb would make a big difference . fairly drinkable for the abv . overall this is a great , but not perfect , barley wine . i 'll have to do another review after i age this for awhile and see how it improves .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	this one hit my abf tasting cup with a resounding splash of nearly opaque cola colour with edges of ruby . i was ratehr amused that on first sniff , there was no real smell at all . on a second try , i picked up on a hint of molasses . the flavour was a nice smoky undertone with a hint of tanginess . it was rounded out by spice and and molasses . body was a bit deceiving . at some points , it felt a little syrupy , and others a bit watery . a good one i enjoyed , and would n't mind having again- but it probably would not be one of my regular beers . be well -uf

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	this is a really nice blended saison style from goose . it 's got a nice effervescence and aromas of citrus and orange . the orange peel really comes through in the flavor , my only complaint is it 's still slightly young on the palate . it 's a bit dry on the finish , but i think it 's got some great potential to shape up really nicely !

0.50 0.40 0.90 0.80 0.90	i found this single , 5ooml brown bottle at sal 's liquors in addison , il for just 99 . the freshness date on the back label is marked oct. 1o , 2o1o , so this bottle is pretty fresh . the beer poured a crystal clear medium gold color and it made a nice 1 finger fizzy white head . unfortunately , the head disappeared rather quickly and did n't even leave a white ring on top . when i say disappeared , i mean totallt disappeared . it also left zero lacing . there was no bad smell to this , but there was no good smell to it either . there was simply no aroma of any kind . i swirled the glass around and stuck my nose down into the glass as far as it would go , and still nothing . this beer is pretty much odorless . taste wise , this is a pretty good lagerr . you can taste both the sweet malt and light grain flavors , and there are just enough hops in here to keep it balanced and give it that beer flavor . light , but not watery mouthfeel , with a pretty high dose of carbonation to keep it crisp and refreshing . this is a very nice pale lager from poland . very easy to drink with only the slightest alcohol aftertaste . i do n't know what their regular price will be after the 99 sale is over , but for now , this is a really good deal .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.60	pours a clear gold with a quarter inch of head and little retention . smells grainy but little else of note . taste is grainy with a little hoppy bitterness and some sweetness finding their place in the finish . mouthfeel is smooth , clean , and crisp . for the style it 's not bad . none of those metallic or overly adjuncty flavors one would associate with this style .

0.90 0.30 0.60 0.70 0.60	it 's hard to make a stout i dont enjoy but i am not so sure about this one . the color is most excellent ( pure pitch black ) and it poured with a nice head but unfiortunately it did n't last and left very little lace on the glass . the generous chunk of yeast left on the bottom of the bottle was unusual for a store bought beer . no smell , i 'll say it again . it had virtually no smell giving me no preview of the first sip . it had a sharp taste on the tongue that seemed to decrease as it warmed up . the finish was long and smooth which saved its rating in this category . not what i expect of a stout . i 'd drink it again but i think it need sfood to bring out its better qualities . the oyster accompaniment recommendation on the bottle seems appropriate .

0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.60	looks like a typical ipa but with a bit frothier head . nice . excellent nose showcasing the belgian yeast strains . definitely a hint of bananas and bubblegum , and hops too . total letdown when i tasted it . almost none of the complexity of the nose is there . even the hops come out kind of boring , with a mild bitterness that does n't satisfy . slightly malty . sorta tastes like just beer . good body and carbonation , but drinkability suffers because it just does n't taste that great .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.50	a pleasant golden colored fluid pours from the brown bottle . the head is fizzy and does n't last very long . a surprising aroma to me ... .buttery , and crisp with some hops too . i enjoy it much . the malt flavors in this beer are vaguely similar to an english ale in a way ... .buttery and a crisp/zingy mouthfeel . the aftertaste is weird to me though . it 's a lingering and unpleasant bitterness that is n't my preferred bitter character flavor . damn , it 's disappointing to have this happen after enjoying the aroma and malts .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	happy to get this through a couple trades , thanks go out to the midwesterners . 12oz bottle poured into wine glass at thai byob restaurant . a : cornlike , crystally yellow with plenty of bubbles . bright white head with strong retention . good looking kolsch . n : not much of anything . really need to seek out the malts , not much heartiness . minimal fruitiness and spices climbing to mostly lemon as it warmed . t : definitely shined more when it was crisp and cold than when it warmed . the malts more here than in the nose and the lemons were again the dominant flavor . still a lack of any of that backended german bite i was expecting and no sense of alcohol . m : spritzy and thin . could use more body . d : probably my least favorite gi so far and i had anticipated it for a while . not horrible , but not something id trade for again . if you handed me one on a summer day or the beach id be happy to drink it but not anything out of the ordinary .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.40	purchased a single of this while in florida . canned on 4/21/2011 the beer has a mild haze to it that cleared nicely ; gubna is a muddled straw color with warmer orange hues . tall white head that quickly receded to half the original size , and then that cap of foam sat patiently for several minutes while i began typing this review . there are limited dabs of lace here and there . wow is this potent . big aroma here , folks . at first large doses of resinous pine waft across the room . then i began to smell angel food cake . this beer smells quite sweet from a distance of several feet . upon closer inspection the nose is very malty . bready and sweet , sort of how moist cornbread can be . though the hops continue to waft in and out , the malt seems to overpower most of the time . i continue to get sweetness , that i again am associating with baked goods - only now i 'm detecting white cupcakes , complete with icing . the taste leads with bitterness , but quickly the malt takes over just as in the aroma . at times the flavor reminds me of 90 minute ipa , essentially a malt forward ipa with some sweetness to it . but this is n't nearly so refined , nor half as enjoyable . the hop flavor is mute - largely powdery bitterness , though some earthy and grassy notes are there to be found . very dry , and also very hot . there 's a long lasting residual warmth deep in the throat . overall : hmm , this is mildly entertaining , but soon enough i am bored and annoyed by aspects of it . as a dipa there are far too many superior examples out there . despite all of the perceived heft 100 ibu 's might have , the beer is exercising little of the might so many hops ought to impart .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured in st bernardus snifter a : solid amber color , two fingers of head that dissipated faster than i expected . left a small amount of lacing behind . s : great smell , fruity although i can not place exactly what fruit . t & m : this beer had really been built up to me prior to drinking . i must admit i was mildly disappointed . the brew had a slightly metallic aftertaste which i was not expecting . it was still very solid though , great belgian strong ale example . slightly fruity taste , hides alcohol level quite nicely . lingers on tongue after drinking . d : highly drinkable , i think letting it breath for few minutes let some the of aromatics out . at the local central market this beer usually sells out the same day a new shipment arrives and i can see why .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.80	bottle courtesy of dkachur - thanks ! tried this one before many a time ( being from ga and all ) , but it 's good to finally sit down and review it . poured into a traditional american pint glass . appearance : pours a nearly completely transparent golden body - apropos of the name - capped by one-finger of foamy , bubbly , pure white head with average retention that ultimately fades to a pretty thick sea foam-esque sheen . well-dispersed bubbles of medium size and medium speed stroll lackadaisically upwards towards the dusting . leaves a few patches and streaks of solid lace on the sides of the glass . aroma : not much goin ' on here . pretty faint and far away , with a few dashes of leafy , hay-like hops , slightly spicy but mostly vegetal , as well as a few sweet , candied lemon/orange zest notes . way too faint , though . taste : pretty simplistic . a few tart and slightly grassy hop notes more than hold their own against a sweet and slightly spicy malt foundation , pale and rudimentary . the grassyness is slightly vegetal in places , too . it 's actually not too sweet , which is nice , given the body . mouthfeel : very well-carbonated , thin , and light . not too many complaints about the mouth - it 's appropriate for the style , and works decently well the flavors . drinkability : probably terrain 's worst beer , though at 5.0 % and given its price and availability at many bars in atlanta/athens , i ca n't knock the drinkability too much . it 's light , inoffensive , relatively easygoing , and actually sort of flavorful - though the flavors really are n't my cup of tea ( beer ) . worth trying , and better than many alternatives at many shitty dives in georgia , so keep an eye out for it if you 're ever in those situations .

0.50 0.20 0.50 0.40 0.20	ugh . the beer is a flaxen gold , with a thin meager ring of head edging the glass . the aroma is diacetyl butterscotch . the flavor is diacetyl butterscotch . tastes like a butterfinger candy bar , with the same sweetness , and perhaps a lackluster toasted malt presence . no hops . no complexity whatsoever . just sweetness . i can imagine that this would be a good beer for your macro buddies , since it 's so candy-like . i thought it completely sucked .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	pour : 22oz bomber to tulip glass . hard pour produces big 3 finger dark brown head over even darker brown body . body is opaque , no light getting through even around the edges . descent is slow and rocky , providing a solid cappuccino like foam . does n't leave a whole lot of webbing along the glass , but a nice cap of lace remains . nose : chocolate and caramel , some fruit notes like plums , brown sugar . quite sweet smelling , marshmallow and milk chocolate . nice roasted malt character as well , a bit of burnt toast , a bit coffee . mmm . mouth : roast character is much more pronounced in flavor than in smell with a chewy , burnt toast feel to it all the way through . a touch of heat as it comes back up . the flavor falls a bit flat , though , as there does n't seem to be a lot more than the roastiness . a roast bitterness lingers , very nice , but where 's the balance ? mouthfeel is quite well carbonated but not as smooth as it could be .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	bottle 1838/2500 a - hazy gold , nice this off white head . reduces to clumps on top . sticky , webbed lacing s - booze ! bourbon , vanilla , malt hiding under there somewhere . t - booze ! tastes like a watered down whiskey . very dry finish , not much sweetness in general . hey , i like alcohol , but i like a little beer in my beer , too . m - booze ! kidding . medium to light . kinda watery . could have been much thicker . d - booze ! not kidding . would tire easily . i like the style , the imperial brown goose is one of my favorites . this one is just a little too 1 dimensional for me .

0.80 0.40 0.90 0.80 0.70	pours a clear mahogany with an off-white head . smell is not attractive : noes of sweet malts and an almost locker-room scent that is a bit startling . taste , on the other hand , is pretty good : brown sugar and toffee maltiness with a woodsy bitterness . medium body is spot on the money . an interesting beer whose aromas are incongruous with its taste .

1.00 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70	pours out a tawny color with a well retaining foamy head that leaves excellent belgian lace . the nose is full of dark fruits and gives off a syrupy sweet smell that pairs well with bruised banana and spicy clove . both the spice and sweetness come out with some alcohol head . the feel is smooth and full bodied . good example of the style overall , yet nothing to write home about .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.60	a-full bronze . big light tan head . brilliantly clear . s-some toasty malt . light citrus hop aroma . not a lot going on . t-carmelly malty . firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their pale ale . not much in the way of hop flavor . lots of bitterness but not much flavor . m-medium bodied . medium carbonation . no alcohol burn . d-an average tasting ipa . needs more hop flavor and aroma . bitterness and malt are spot on . still not a bad beer .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.60	this is so thick and viscous that you can tell by just looking at it . the carbonation slowly struggles through to form a bit of off-white lacing in this slightly hazy amber brew . the bouqet is powerful , with bubble gum , circus peanuts ( the candy ) , bananas , caramel , toffee , honey , flowers , and a hint of the big alcohol that awaits . taste is a thick , prominent malt sweetness followed by a moderate bitterness and some alcohol burn on the end , but it could be worse considering the abv . mouthfeel is super thick with a just a tinge of carbonation noticeable . drinkability suffers due to the huge abv . this went well with a salty , deep blue cabrales from spain .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	picked up a bomber at julio 's liquors in westborough , ma . a : medium cranberry hue . off white head has slight red tint . good clarity . s : i was expecting a big nose on this but it actually had a relatively unpronounced aroma . essentially a soft malt aroma with some distinct raspberry and grape highlights . these characteristics strengthen as beer warms . t : tart and almost too sour raspberry flavor is prominent . sweet malt flavor is just enough to balance out the puckering raspberry . some oaky highlights also noticeable . mf : tartness affects mouthfeel giving it a feeling of fullness but the beer is really not that heavy . slight alcohol warming . tartness makes you want more . d : an intriguing if not particularly drinkable beer . raspberry flavor is laid on pretty thick . could be a little better balanced .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	very deep copper/light mahogany body topped by a thick , creamy , tan head . the head grudgingly fades , but it clings to the glass like an obsessive lover . aroma has nice sweet notes , but it 's dominated by hop perfume . nice pine and floral notes abound . as for the flavor , bitterness runs rampant . pine rosin , grapefruit rind , and herbal bitterness obscures most of the malt and alcohol sweetness . a bit of heat can be felt , but that 's about it . nice if you like hop juice , but really one-dimensional . mouthfeel is a bit thick as expected . drinkability is great for hop\heads . not really a session beer or one that i 'd even come close to calling `` quaffable '' , but enjoyable none the less . a solid offering for those who love hops , but the uninitiated may run from this beer 'wailing ' .

0.60 0.70 0.60 0.40 0.40	soooo ... fat tire . we meet again . first had this a few years ago on a business trip to seattle . i looked at my co-worker & said `` something wrong with your beer ? yuck . '' we dumped them . tried it again a year ago . i managed to power through the bomber in about three hours , but it no longer revolted me . so ... monday night , bowling , our lanes break down & the waitress offers us free beers . i order a mothership wit . and get a ... fat tire . usually when i 'm in the `` c '' range on brews , it 's due to a lack of taste , or lack of distinction , with just nothing standing out . that 's not the case here . fat tire tastes like its name . i 'm always reminded of bicycle rubber & beer-soaked bread when i put this in my mouth , & it 's not a real pleasant combo for me . it 's weird & unique - but not in a good way . i left half the free bomber in the alley . i can stomach fat tire , but it 's appeal remains a mystery to me .

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured a satisfying dark brown black . an immediate coarsely bubbled head made its appearance , gave a bow and immediately retired . gone . maybe my glass was contaminated and killed the head . but sitting there in my glass the beer looked like a forlorn abandoned day-old beer . no nose -- zip nothing.. do i have a cold ? maybe a hair of alcohol note but hard for me to tell . flavor was a robust strong ale with an up front hops flavor but i had hoped for more -- toasted malt at least , maybe a hair of coffee or hickory or ... the one-dimensional flavor while it made for a generally enjoyable beer but not remarkable nor memorable . finish was fast descent into obscurity . mouthfeel was a lively chorus of effervessence . drinkability seemed to be generally better than many heavy alcohol laden beers -- i could drink several without becoming soused .

0.50 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	unimpressed by the aroma , watery coffee is predominate , but luckly the flavor is better . coffee and big chocolate malts are forefront , only a little alcohol heat . nice mouthfeel from the oatmeal : velvety and smooth with a medium/thick body . not really worth the $ 17 bottle price tag though at all , there are a good amount of coffee stouts that are better that sell for much lower prices . kopi luwak is a huge fad too , it 's a joke in the coffee world , but the mainstream world loves its hype . keep up the hype on this . keep it up .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60	a- pours a nice yellow-orange color , thin off white head that leaves lots of lacing/legs . smell- smell is eathy herbal , a hint of brett is present , i am getting the sweaty horse blanket aromas that are present in belgians , i havent had too many english ipas i am not sure if this fits the profile t- is not what you would expect from a stone beer , im getting a strong grapefruit bitterness , with a lingering sour note in the back of the palate . m- effervesent light body , lighter than expected for an imperial beer . d- i would be able to drink 2 pints of this max , i am a bit of a hop head and this beer only teases my palate , i get an aggresive bittering hop/ grapefruit taste but not much hop presence in the aroma

0.60 0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40	poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter . ah , belgian ipas . we meet again . there 's really nothing i 've had to make me a belgian ipa believer , let 's see if this hits the mark . appearance-wise , it 's solidly average . an aggressive pour reveals a red-tinged mildly hazy golden brew with a finger 's worth of head that does n't retain well at all . the aroma is actually kind of nice , with belgian sugars pairing with just a tinge of citrus hops . the sugars are really the star of the show here , and come through very strongly on the nose . the taste is just ok . the ipa part really does n't come through here at all , this just tastes a lot like a strong belgian blonde . the sweet belgian sugars and yeast really overpower here , along with a hint of fusel alcohol that really is n't all that pleasant . if the hops are to be detected at all , it 's on the long-end of the finish . the mouthfeel is very highly carbonated for the style , and just a bit drying on the finish . the drinkability is alright for the abv , but i just do n't find the overwhelming sweetness to make a very drinkable brew . overall , there 's nothing ipa-like about this brew . this is just a strong belgian blonde , through and through . and not a great one , i 'd take two leffes any day over one of these .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	pours a dark amber - a nice burnt orange . small head is white . leaves little lace . great nose - big , malty , sweet . smells like barley malt fresh out of the bag . quite a large sweetness on the tip . a rather abrasive malt profile - i hate to use that word , but it best describes it for me . it tastes good , but the malts are slightly harsh . nice flavors all the way through , but fails to deliver a big full mouthfeel as promised by the nose and malty attack on the tip . the finish cleans out fairly well . a beer with planty of flavor , just shy of stepping up to the top tier of marzen beers .

0.40 0.40 0.50 0.70 0.80	a - lighter in color than most porters . almost more of a dark amber than a porter . lots of carbonation , got at least 2 fingers of head space out of the bottle . s - not much scent here , nothing bad nothing good . t- nothing as far as roasted malts or chocolate tastes . not bad for a lighter porter though . m - again the mouth feel is light , this could be a more of a session porter . d - enjoyable lighter beer , i can see having a couple of these in one sitting . i would drink this again if offered one , but i will probably seek out more substantial porters in the future .

0.50 0.70 0.50 0.50 0.40	appearance - pours a pale , hazed straw . a watery , bubbly white cap forms but is gone in moments . not enough foam to generate any lace . aroma - grainy , a fruity , citrusy orange sweetness that is n't all that complex but is pleasant . taste - yeasty flavor , thin grain , some decent fruitiness but there is a seltzery flavor throughout . the most prominent flavor is a hefe like grain and yeast combo . the aftertaste into the finish has some hop balance , but it is partially masked by the salty seltzer flavor . mouthfeel - crisp , thin , and light . more like a macro lager in the mouthfeel than a wit . drinkability - it 's okay in a pinch but better wits are easily found .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.80 0.80	running out of beers to try and i have been avoiding this one but the time has come , alas : poured from a bottle into a shaker . pours a light straw with an active half finger head that diminishes and disappears almost immediately , no stick . aroma is the green bottle skunked hops aroma that you get from some of these types of `` imports '' not necessarily bad , but very strong and overpowers the grain bill completely . the light struck hop aroma pretty much covers the spectrum and reaches out and grabs you from feet away . flavor is not what i expected , moderately crisp and bready . musty yeast notes come through on the biscuity flavor that hints at sweetness , but not too much . hop flavor is a little off , it gives one the sense that a small amount of hops were boiled into oblivion to extract every little micron of hop oil , and then left to get light-struck in a green bottle . the flavor is not a bad lager yeast , grainey flavor . it 's just not great . mouthfeel is thin and crisp , about on par with most lagers .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours beautifully from the nitro-can , dark with a large cascading foamy head . smell is weak , thankfully the taste is not . thicker mouthfeel than the guinness nitro-can , which has a much more watery consistancy . at 4 % alcohol , it goes down nice and easy .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60	first review in a couple of months . let 's give it this one a go . so , this is the `` session beer '' by stone , ballast point , and the guy who played frasier , apparently . pours a pale color with a soft , white head that sticks around for a while . the aroma is really great . big hop presence and a flavor profile that screams west coast . there was a big drop off in the taste . it seems as if there was one hop addition at the beginning of the boil and then nothing until it was dry hopped . it is not a harsh bitterness , but it seems to be the only component of the taste . not really something i would seek out again as i really do n't care for the taste . also , it 's not a good value ( $ 3.20 for a single at a place that has the best prices in the area ) at all for a `` small '' beer .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	pours a hazy copper orange color with a thin off white creamy head . mildly strong citrus hop aroma that smells a tough tart . the flavor has a smooth malty background with well balanced citrus and earthy hop bitterness . it has a medium body with moderate carbonation . the finish is semi-sweet as the hop flavor dissipates and a subtle warming sensation grows and lingers for a while after the end .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50	12 oz . bottle . the beer pours a clear dark red with a creamy light tan head and soapy lacing . the aroma is roasty , malty , and somewhat grassy . the flavor has a lot roast with notes of nuts and bitter- sweet chocolate with a bitter almost astringent bite in the finish . the finish becomes less astringent as it warms but it still has a chalky and unpleasant mouth feel .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	cloudy grapefruit colour with noticeable white crown , generous lace left in glass . sour flemish aroma , sour apple , somewhat like a wild ale . numbing sour mouthfeel , with significant carbonation , refreshing . not for a newbie . sour apple cider in taste .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	a-pours am opaque , pitch black color with two fingers of fluffy , tan head . s-smells of heavily roasted coffee , a bit of chocolate , and that 's about it on this one . t-roasted coffee upfront with those nice characteristic porter notes : chocolate and roasted malt with some vanilla notes . m-slick and creamy , yet light-bodied with moderate carbonation . d-this a very easy drinking coffee porter , but i agree with whoever added this beer that this is not an imperial porter . i really like how the coffee is balanced with the beer instead of over-powering it .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80	pours a lovely dark black with barely any head , a bit of tan around the edges of where the head should be . smells heavenly , like sweet coffee on christmas morning . dark chocolate dominates the nose . tastes a bit watery up front , with a bit of dark roasted malt and chocolate . a slight hop bitterness , which is heightened by the carbonation . a bit tart with a clean finish . the aftertaste that lingers reminds you a bit of wood , but that is all . mouthfeel is a bit odd with a very effervescent feel . a bit watery as well . it is quite smooth and easy going however . a good looking beer that smells perfect , but ca n't hold up in the taste realm . i bet this would be a mind blowing beer on cask ! ! as i sip this beer it seems to be all over the place , one time it tastes great , the next it seems a little funny . i will certainly have to try it again .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	poured into a glass . a- poured a black amber hue . 2 finger head . very pretty darkest new belgium . s- only could smell sweet and smoke . t- not as sweet as i thought it was by the smell . the taste of smoke is apparent . atleast to my tongue . earthy and smokey . this was a very good . m- perfect carbonation . no hiccups . overall this was a good beer . not super thin but it could be thicker but i wouldnt take point off of this area just for that . it was great . d- high . the only off area was the smell which is usually the area that lacks in most of my reviews . overall this was a great beer . highly passes my expectations . possibly the highest beer in the new belgium brewing co. amazing .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.50	12oz . bottle served in a pilsener glass . best before 04/11/09 ( yikes ) indicated on the bottle . poured a translucent orange-gold with a two inch frothy , bright white head that left behind a thick band of lacing as it collapsed . copious tiny bubbles present in solution . nose was somewhat skunky - that 's it . taste was primarily cereal grains ( very light ) and wet cardboard with a little bit of corn syrup sweetness lingering at the finish . mouthfeel was light-bodied and lightly carbonated ; probably the best feature of this brew . not terrible , but not great either . the more i drank this , the less appealing it was .

1.00 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured from a caged bomber . a : well , black as night as expected . small , 1/4 inch head with a little froth to it . s : roasted barley ? a little caramel , and some toffee . much more robust than i was expecting . t : rich , with a strong hop taste up front . creamy in the end , with a little expresso . m : thick , but not chewy ( if that makes sense ) . a mild sweet , stickiness to it , but not overpowering . o : a great example of a is , not too sweet , nor too much coffee . you need a wood fire to go with this one . wish i was back in minnesota with this beer !

0.70 0.20 0.50 0.70 0.50	i drank this from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass . the bere pours brown with a light tan head . the aroma is really bad , it almost smells like chroline . i thought it be the glass but then i poured it for my table mates into different glasses and they got the same thing . the taste is much better than the aroma , but that 's still not saying a lot . its light coffee mostly . the feel is pretty light . overall , another st to run from . the aroma just crushes this .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70	had this on tap at the lion 's pride pours an orange amber color with a very white head it is thick and creamy with ample lacing . the aroma is fresh very hoppy , citrus with earthy notes . the aroma is like a fresh hop cone very nice . latter notes of malt in the back support with a slight buttery crystal malt . the mouth is smooth . from what you expect with the aroma is a slight let down but that said it is nice . the taste malty to start the taste turns to a earthy hop flavor . the taste is a bitter finish but finishes very clean . a well round ipa . if the mouth were a tad heavier you could easily convince me that it was a double ipa

0.70 0.50 0.90 0.90 0.70	12 oz bottle poured jet black into pint glass with nice fluffy tan head . head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing . smell is very muted , i almost wonder if my senses are failing me but then i remember the overwhelmingly satisfying scent of a different espresso imperial stout last night , so i know its not me . mostly smell a molasses with mild hints of chocolate malt & can barely pick up the oat scent , but its there . taste is completely different . immediately get a chocolate woody flavor profile early on with the oatmeal speaking through in the end . this stout is not too sweet , but just enough for balance . not too heavy , carbonation is spot on . overall , not a bad imperial stout . i was expecting more from this one . maybe i just got a bad bottle . i will give it another try soon .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	a : a nice amber , clear beer . small head , but the lacing stays throughout the beer . a moderate amount of bubbles rise from the bottom . s : has a sweet smell of caramel . t : the alcohol is a little bit forward to me . i tend to like the alcohol to be well hidden , but this beer is a little less balanced than i prefer . some would really dig it . m : a decent amount of carbonation with sharp notes on the front on the tongue . d : an okay winter warmer . will probably not buy anymore .

0.70 0.60 0.60 1.00 1.00	a - amber , virtually the ideal shade of amber with just the right ( at least in my mind ) amounts of yellow , red and brown . frothed up with a one finger head , almost no retention , no lacing . a bit dissappointing , but the color makes up for that . s - mostly pine and floral hops on the nose . slight metals and a bit of malty tones , i 'd expect better from troegs . t - i take that back ! this is what i expect from troegs ! it is a strong , but not overwhelming pine hop kick upfront . a slight caramel malt taste compliments the hops just right . a bit of dark fruit and flowery notes as well . amazingly well rounded . for the style , i can not picture a way to improve upon this taste . m - thin and flat . fairly refreshing . not terrible , but again i 'd expect more from troegs in this category . d - this beer is very good all around . smell could be better , but as far as drinkability goes , it 's top notch . would go well with almost any meal or as a session beer . definitely a must try . another great troegs beer !

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	picked up a bomber of this at my local liquor store yesterday . pours a dark black with a huge `` root beer '' style head . great retention with thick globs of lacing on the sides of the glass . this beer has a very appealing look ! aroma is mellow . nothing super amazing going on here . mostly malts . taste is a nice balance between malts and hops and finishes with a dry bitterness . this beer is simple , but good . this beer is rich and satisfying . the dry bitterness on the backend keeps me coming back for another sip . overall this is a good beer . very enjoyable , but not anything that is over the top amazing ... just a good beer !

0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	picked this up at goebel 's in wichita pours an effervescent golden/bronze with some pearl colored head . minimal lacing & zero head retention , some oily sheen s : pears , honey , & apples , booze t : honey , a kiss of booze , apple peels & a touch of lemony hops of front . dryness , white grapes , cloying sweet apple cider as this warms . finishes sweet with a touch of ruby grapefruit & more dryness mf : sticky , with slight over carbonation drinks slow , just does n't quite pull together with too much sweetness & not enough hoppyness , another one from a brewery that fails to impress on a consistent basis ; caveat emptor..

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	another nice treat from weyerbacher . this is a nice autumnal beer with plenty of hints of pumpkin pie spice , cloves and nutmeg . not overly hopped , a nicely balanced beer with plenty of veggie pumpkin frontend with a dry spiced backend . pairs well with turkey , honeybaked ham and other holiday treats . a : deep red hues with fine microbubbling . head is fast bubbling and racing to dissipation within 15 seconds . s : pumpkin pie baby ! ! ! seriously , smells of a fall harvest . very nice . t : pumpkin spice , clove , nutmeg and caramel from the malts . the spices linger on the tongue making the aftertaste and breathing quite enjoyable . little if no bitter from the hops . m : light carbonation , medium-rich , dry with spice finish . d : dangerous , because it 's delicious . not a heady brew , so beware if you drink more than one . pairs well with a lot of fall foods . pork , chicken , desserts , etc .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.20	chilled bottle into a glass . purchased at k & l in redwood city for something like $ 12 . a : pours a pitch black at first glance , but it 's actually a dark brown with some ruby highlights ( judging from the stream that comes out of the bottle ) . in the glass it has zero light penetration . the head is half an inch of espresso brown bubbles , and it recedes quickly into a light cap on the brew . nice lacing during each swig , but most of it falls down the glass instead of sticking . s : at first it had a strong waft of earthiness and coffee , but as it warmed , the smell became very muted . some general sweetness and chocolate . nothing pronounced . t : licorice and chocolate-covered cherries dominate . there 's also a strong earthy hop flavor , but it gets hidden as the beer warms and the sweeter flavors take over . pepper , coffee , and roasted malts are strong on the finish , with just the tiniest hint of licorice lingering in the aftertaste . m : full , heavy body . carbonation consists of fine bubbles , and it 's a tad high for an ris . gives it a little sting on the finish to work with the pepper bite . only the lightest hint of a boozy warmth in the aftertaste . really smooth . d : it was n't offensive , but i have no desire to pay $ 12 for this again .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	many thanks to lou91 for sending a beer i 've been excited about trying . clear golden straw color ... almost like watered down honey . thin white head that quickly fizzles away . the nose is more akin to pineapple than watermelon . slight wheat smell and a hint of doughy yeast . once again the taste is closer to pineapple but there 's some watermelon flavor to it after it warms to room temperature . dirty unkind wheat flavors . not my favorite brew overall but i 'm glad i got the chance to try it . i think 21st 's small capacity is the best thing this beer has going for it because it keeps people wanting to try it .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	pours deep orange , almost red , with lots of carbonation forming a persistent one-finger deep head . smells neutral at first , then smells a bit sour . starts a bit sweet then gets tart . the sourness intensifies through beer towards the finish making this beer sort gueze-like . a powdery caramel character manages to surface through the tart character , but this beer is otherwise all about the yeasties doing their thing ; `` tarting '' up the beer with sourness and complex fruit flavors . reminds me a bit of a jolly pumpkin beer , but i 'm not sure which one . this is my second bottle of this beer . i had the first one a few months ago and it was even more sour . it seems to have mellowed an become more quaffable ( despite it 's alcohol content ! ) i imagine this what some of the original farmhouse saisions were like a hundred or so years ago , except probably not as strong .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50	no bjcp for this style so im just going to shoot from my hip here . smell is low floral hoppiness . gold color . clear thin white head . not alot of flavor , like at all . low malt flavor . low adjunct flavor . low hop flavor . and high alcohol flavor . im sorry but this be just reminds me of the stuff i used to drink out of a 40 oz bottle when i was 17. the flavor of the malts just do not hold up to the flavor of alcohol . in fact all the flavors combined do not balance out the flavor of alcohol . medium low body . crisp finish , but the taste of adjunct lingers . im not really sure what they were going for here . isnt `` imperial pilsner '' synonymous with `` malt liquor ? '' in theory this beer should work , take twice as much pilsner malt for the same amount of water , add twice as much yeast , lager . but i dont know what went wrong for them . sorry . my judgement is pass on this one .

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured from the can to a snifter , review is from notes taken on 1/29/2010 . thanks to mpls for including this in a trade ! appearance : pour is a very deep dark brown and starts with a 1/2 finger , light tan head that is creamy looking , but fades almost immediately to nothing but a thin ring around the surface and a light whisp that is unevenly distributed over the top ; body is nearly opaque with the exception of some deep ruby highlights taht appear when held to the light that offer up a glimpse of what looks like pretty strong carbonation ; lots of spotty lacing is left on the sides of the glass . smell : not especially potent and kind of underwhelming . light hints of some earthy hoppiness and a lightly sweet maltiness that becomes a little more pronounced as it warms . taste : very nice flavors combine here -- right away there is a burst of that bitter and earthy hoppy flavor that combines with a nutty sweet ( but not sugary or carmally ) maltiness ; slight hints of a dry cocoa and amildly roasted coffee presence . mouthfeel : body is a little thin , and the carbonation is a little harsh at first -- once the blast of carbonation washes away the body feels smooth and even a little creamy ; a moderate stickiness is left on the roof of the mouth . drinkability : the numbers do n't really show it , but i give it a 4 overall as i really enjoy the flavors and feel that i would find this to be a pretty refreshing beverage on a warm spring day , but not in the dog days of summer , as it does start to sit a little heavy on the belly .

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	a big pastel cherry whipped mousse briefly drifts above the dark ruby red ale , arresting at a thin blanket covering . this one is pristinely clear , without any active carbonation , and puts up a thin film with each swirl , but no lace . the aroma is that of a rich red wine , high in fresh fruit and tart cherry . exactly what i had hoped for , and think this style strives to achieve . complex undertones reveal the earthiness of damp autumn woodland , as it warms . oud beersel is tart , without the whole mouth pucker typical of this style . the cherry flavor is forward and clear , with high acidity . some saltiness shows up in the finish . while there is a sweet side , it is kept well in check . a bone dry beer with a medium body and light astringency and prickly carbonation . the alcohol is greater than anticipated , and interesting , given that it is labeled as 4 % . a well done beer , fits my ommagange tulip glass , and is probably sessionable for some , but for me this style is intended to be a punctuation . either as an aperitif or in place of a cocktail , this will easily cut any fatty cheese . a ton of character , oud beersel is my opinion of a stunning example of what this style can achieve . unpretentious and impeccably crafted , this is a gastronomical work of art .

0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	pours a dull chestnut with a respectable bone-colored head . aroma is dark fruits , sweet macerated figs or raisins mixed with candy sugar . taste is surprisingly dry , lots of bready , musty caramel malt flavors . some mild dark fruit , maybe some prune juice or cola , finish is very slightly sweet . classic dubbel flavors , very solid and sessionable . mouthfeel is medium , not real heavy , quite drinkable . my impression is of an abbey ale with training wheels -- not to imply it is lesser , by any means -- but without the depth and complexity of its higher-abv bretheren . i may like it even better this way .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	12oz bottle into pint glass . pours a golden brown biscuit color with a 1 finger inner almond colored head . big bubbles , no lacing . nose presents juicy flavors of dried mango and apricot with a bit of citrus and rosewater . taste is very bitter upfront , slightly sweet , with hints of caramel malt and resinous pine . moderate to light carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel with a slight resinous stickiness . overall a great beer , nice balance of lightness and flavor . not the best beer these guys make but definitely tasty !

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60	pretaste notes : soba is a sort of noodle made in japan made of wheat . an obi is a sort of sash worn around the waist , so a black obi would be something like a black belt in karate . appearance : poured from the 22oz bottle into an imperial pint.the beer is a very very dark reddish-brown color , topped with a head that grew to 3 fingers , but fizzled out pretty quickly . head was a light tan , with a slightly reddish tinge . smell : introduced to the nose with a quick hit of cherries , then faded into a soft toffee note . caramel is lurking around in there somewhere , but overall the aroma is balanced by a light flowery hop note . confusing smell here , but not unpleasant , just ... weird . taste : it seems this beer has somewhat of an identity crisis . so many tastes here to identify . starts with a light malty note containing toffee , semisweet to bitter chocolate , and something else i ca n't put my finger on . perhaps that would be the soba , but i ca n't be too sure . there 's a fruit note in the middle that tastes like apricot or peach . balanced later on with a quick floral note , and then becoming clean towards the finish , with a strange mix of all these characteristics in the finish . overall , this beer was really interesting , and a work out for the tastebuds . not bad , but i do n't think i 'd pick it up again ...

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	i 'm not sold on this belgian . it pours a clear golden hue with a small white creamy head , no lace , not much retention either . the nose is very good and very belgiany . you get the nice coriander and clove smells , the nice sweet malts , the candied sugars , and some yeasty florals too . i only wish the taste followed the aroma . the taste is compromised somewhat because the beer is quite flat and lacking carbonation . more fizz would have helped , even some of the mouth prickly yeasty fizz would have helped . there is also a sharp spiciness and bite in the finish that is really the undoing of the coriander , clove , and belgiany midsection . the spice tartness in the finish is this beer 's undoing . there is a touch of herbal floral in the finish too , but that spicy bite just slays everything otherwise worthy . the 7.7 % abv is hidden a bit , but it is more noticeable by the finish . i 'm not sold on this beer at all and i find it a tad disappointing .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	drank from an 8 fl . oz . bottle purchased at colonial spirits , acton , ma poured a deep , hazy amber with a off white , fizzy head . later , this faded to a thick film with a substantial ring of lace ( this stayed until the end of the drink ) . large clumps of bubble ridden lacing lasted well after the beer was finished . smell was very mild . malty and slightly peaty with a bit of fruit . some crisp hops lay in the background . as the beer warmed , some sweet caramel malts became apparent as well . taste was malty and alcohol rich . syrupy , sugary and fruity as well as a bit peppery . the alcohol warming effect was apparent from start to finish but , to my surprise , it was never biting or overwhelming . somewhat dry , clean finish . mouthfeel was creamy and smooth but light . drinkability was outstanding especially when considering that this beer is a whopping 13 % abv . the alcohol did however catch up with me in a big way after i was finished .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	pours a deep carmel , maybe a bit hazy . very little head , minimal lacing . yummy , sweet , deep malt . abv present , but smells delicious . alcohol , somewhat dry . a bit watery . quite strange . not much else . maybe a bit yeasty/bready . seems like a lot missing . sits well , abv not overpowering . im searching for the malt though . decent , not sure i would go back to it . id like a bit more walt , less watery flavor .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	sierra ovila , bottle bought at whole foods bowery for $ 10.99 ( overpriced , in my opinion , but i *had* to have it ) . big bottle , caged and corked . it opened with an explosion , almost , sort of a champagne noise and pop . appearance : served in my sierra xxx anniversary snifter ( for once , it fits ! ) , ovila pours rushed , as if it could n't wait to get out of the bottle . a very prominent head quickly forms , but it soon diminishes into less than a finger of pale-chestnut-colored topping crown . good retention throughout but barely any lacing . color is seriously dark and impenetrable , blacker than any other dubbel i 've seen and tasted . smell : after a first beautiful impression , ovila disappoints with a very soft , underwhelming nose . notes of cane sugar , toffee . some raisin juice and light spice . yeast and freshly-baked whole-wheat bread at the end . taste : follows nose , but fortunately on a slightly bigger , better path . some spice , yeast and bread . banana pudding , coconut shavings and brown sugar at the end . finishes dry , slightly bitter and a tad watery . mouthfeel : medium body and flavor , full and beautiful carbonation ( but not overtly carbonated like many dubbels and belgians ) . dry spicy finish that lingers in the mouth and prickles the tongue . overall : i wanted to like ovila ( for various personal , historic and artistic reasons all related to the namesake spanish monastery this beer is named for and after ) more than i actually did , but i still enjoyed it enough . a little thin all around , sure , but also so very drinkable and pleasant . usually i do n't drink belgians ( too heavy/yeasty/spicy/filling ) but ovila , without being outstanding or mind-blowing , i would drink again . it also helps a good cause ... ca n't wait to visit the reconstructed ovila chapter house in california , not far from chico !

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	generous sticky white head sat on top of the clear , slightly-darker-than-straw colored lager . hay and some sweetness give this beer a fairly simple aroma . grainy flavored beer with some faint pale malt sweetness . slight astringency plays off the touch of bitterness and hop flavor for a sort of 3-d hop experience . [ note : this would be considered an overly hoppy beer by anyones standards ] finishes pretty dry . nice creamy mouthfeel and medium body make this one fine beer to have in your mouth

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.70	this is from the new 2003-4 bottling , recently released , so presumably therefore contract-brewed at f.x . matt . deep-reddish-amber with an off-white head that vanishes quite quickly to nearly nothing . big aroma of alcohol and vinous fruit , almost christmas pudding-like . malt , fruit and alcohol notes conquer the taste buds , pleasant and warming but a bit 'rough ' compared to other barleywines ; the alcohol bite is quite prominent so not a smooth drinking beer . quite a monster by nature as well as name .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	a- transparent golden yellow body with thin white head that quickly disappears . leaves no lacing . s- excellent . wheat , yeast , and citrus immediately hit the nostrils as you pour this one . t- initial taste of sweet malt and citrus . then light refreshing hops . sweet carmel lingers . m- high carbonation and light body . goes down easy . d- this was a solid offering from magic hat . i would venture to have this one again . its taste and mouthfeel make it very drinkable .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70	this poured a bright , clear gold with white head . it smelled like sweet and creamy yeast with a bit of honey malt and lemon hops . it tasted like creamy yeast and sweet lemon hops , with a bit of copper hops and fresh wheat malt . it was oily with a bit of carbonation , and had a mildly bitter aftertaste . overall this was very clean and easy to drink . it had nice body , and had a simple and enjoyable flavor . this just seemed like it was missing something , which makes it very forgettable . the weasel needs more kick !

0.80 0.50 1.00 0.60 0.60	review from notes from tonight . bottle thanks to my awesome girlfriend ... split with ericandersnavy . label says no crusts , so this entry needs to be corrected . i have submitted it . poured a nice brown with about a finger of head ... the nose was.. a huge letdown . it honestly smelled like bean sprouts with a bit of peanut in there ... . there was a fresh `` green '' aroma i could only link to the smell of bean sprouts , or alfalfa sprouts . there was a hint of raspberry ... which i could say was jelly . taste was very sweet in the front , and finished a bit on the tart side . in the middle there was peanut flavor , but again , it seemed like fresh peanut flavor , green ... eric said it best when he said it seemed like boiled peanuts . if anyone is from the south , it tasted like the boiled peanut water . no jelly at all . to be honest , i got mustard on the finish . does anyone put mustard on a pb and j ? i dont eat them , so i dont know , but i assume not . the mouthfeel was great , i cant remember the last time i had something with such tiny carbonation ! it was like an explosion in my mouth , fantastic ! overall though , this was a huge letdown . i was expecting so much , and got so little in return . i am glad actually have someone i tried this with that will rate it though ... maybe i had a bad bottle ? i dont know , but from their other offerings i have tried and rated , this was a huge letdown .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	a - nice copper color - light head s - not too much . can not pick up much hops or malt t - average for and extra pale ale . like the smell , light in the hops and light in the malt . m - ok - metallic finish d - well when you are stuck in the delta crown room and you have a choice of bud , molson , coors , miller lite and sweetwater 420 , it is very drinkable ... lol . but to be completely frank , it is average .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.60	12 oz bottle into a snifter glass a : pours a deep golden/caramel brown . looks like a glass of bourbon with head . head pours fluffy white , recedes sort of quick to a few patches on top and a thin lace . s : notes of sticky bourbon , sweet alcohol and toasty oak come through . earthy and fruity . very pleasant complexity that is worth lingering over . t : carmel and vanilla notes , sweetness of bourbon with a lingering smokiness from the cask . you can tell they used a damn good bourbon , makes me think of fall . m : this is the weakest part of the beer , a bit light on carbonation , the beer feels a bit thin . this is probably due to the addition of bourbon to the beer , and probably why most bourbon beers are darker stouts or porters . still it was interesting , and almost better to have it with the caramel color than a darker beer . d : drinkable for the 8.2 abv , but i dont know how many of these i would want to choke down . better for an after dinner thing .

0.60 0.20 0.60 0.20 0.20	i heard a lot of buzz around this beer and when i saw it at the liquor store i knew i had to pick up a couple . i split one with two friends and here 's how it went ... . a= not too bad pretty basic . classic fizzy yellow color with a tiny head that falls quickly with no lacing . s= things went down hill from here . wow what was i thinking . this one smells like those jalepenos in a jar at the store but worst . there 's the smell of the crappy beer in it as well that sort of makes it smell like someone puked up those jalepenos and wanted you to drink the mess . t= after seeing my friends reactions i was growing more interested . i took my sip . sort of tastes like a warm corona not bad . then i swallowed . the back was where the heat was . not overly hot but just enough to make this beer a mess . the feeling of this beer in my belly made me want to throw up . m= average mouthfeel . this beer was awful but you know they mouthfeel was n't as bad as some others . d= never never again . i refuse to drain pour a beer just because i personally think its a little silly . i 'm a little tight with my money so if beer is there it 's gon na get drunk . if i would have drank this on my own who knows . the sick feeling i got from this beer resting in my belly lasted for quite a while and pretty much cut me off that night . if i would have drank another beer i would have become quite queezy i think . not the best experience .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.60	had this on-tap at brick house brewery in patchogue . the appearance is average -- crisp amber color . the smell is amazing -- like a nice plate of blueberries . the taste is also very good -- sweet but not overbearingly so . mouthfeel is good , tho ' there is a good amount of carbonation which meaks the drinkability questionable . could have one or two of these , but would be reaching for something else after that .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	enjoyed in a pint glass . a : moderate pour leaves minimal white , fizzy head . chill haze or slightly cloudy gold . more head please . s : honeydew melon . man candy-esque . hops are juicy smelling . very complex and citrus-fruity aroma . t : mmmm ! fruity with hop and alcohol coming in in the aftertaste . the fruit and hop do n't blend perfectly though and so i subtracted points for that . citrus hop came up with a burp . m : bright , then an off flavor affiliated with heat , then bitterness . d : this is a tasty beer on the verge of being terrific . a solid offering , i would have a few of these . maybe i 'll try to homebrew it !

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50	on tap at the brewpub . the beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head . the aroma is a mix of grain and wheat notes , with a little bit of belgian yeast mixed in . fairly bland overall and not really what i expect in a saison . the flavor is similarly disappointing . i get a lot of grain notes , as well as some belgian yeast and a little bit of spice . not very exciting and nothing really present in the flavor that stands out or impresses . overall , the flavors are a little muddled and do n't really work well together . medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	typical gold body , with a thin head . small clumps of lace slide down the sides of the glass after each sip or quaff . somewhat skunky aroma , but that 's no surprise coming from a green bottle . after all the studies that have been done on this stuff , why to some brewers still use green glass ? i just do n't get it . the taste is above average for a macro lager . good malt/hop balance , with a decent aftertaste ; at least you know you 're getting more than just colored water . rather aggressive carbonation -- i like that in a lager . drinkability is just fine , and i can imagine that this one would pair favorably with many savory foods , not to mention salty bar snacks .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60	a : extremely carbonated . fluffy uneven head . carbonation rushing to the top like i 've never seen . slightly dull gold . s : alcohol very apparent , yeast and therefore bready . t : alcohol is quite forward , however fairly well blended . otherwise difficult to describe . soft and medium bodied . slightly yeasty m : soft but mutely astringent d : not bad , but the flavor does n't stand out . inoffensive but uninteresting .

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	a : murky golden amber color with single finger head s : tons of citrus . very aromatous . t : lemon custard and wheat mostly with some mild earthy notes m : light body and high carbonation . crisp . overall : had this at the brewery . a typical hefe really . nothing too special .

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.90 0.80	mouthfeel and smell are nothing that stands out for the style but not at all bad either . some malts and alcohol in the smell , along with a decent hop spice and lively carbonation on the palate . appearance ; nice off white head that reduces to a thin film that maintains through most of the drink . amber but not as dark as others of this style , quite nice to look at , a few bubbles run from top to bottom . taste ; really complex malts , almost gets sweet but the hops give it a finishing bitterness . bready aftertaste is really nice with a bit of toast . this is a quite good example of the style . two sided with malts and hops , the balance could be better but this makes it complexer . drinkability ; this stuff taste pretty good and the aftertaste is really pleasant . one could drink a lot of this , one of the better mrzens .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	a - rich , clean reddish color , slight head . a refreshing looking beer . s - carmel with a hint of wildflowers ; overripe honeysuckle from a distance . t - a little woodsy and wild . sweet at the front of the tongue with strong malt flavor overshadowing all at the back . little aftertaste other than a slight molasses taste . m - crisp at the start , but a little thick going down -- heavy malt and bread taste almost makes it like eating good pancakes with maple syrup . perhaps too thick for some , but a good feeling if you like that sort of thing . d - i could drink this for awhile , it is flavorful enough to not get boring but refreshing enough to not weigh down the mouth .

0.50 0.30 0.70 0.90 1.00	ok lionheads best cheap beer you can buy i dont get why people around my area drink bud light ... when you can get lionshead for 10.99 a case or $ 50 for a 1/2 barrel come on this best is awesome ... i can drink massive quanities of this beer ..its the best cheap beer in the world and o yeah you get little riddles on the bottom of the caps..

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.60 0.80	~ review of bottle from 2009 ~ i 1st tried this fresh about a year ago - this review is based on my 2nd tasting of the '09 nemesis and is my first review on ba - please go easy on me ; ) tasting date - 2/23/11 appearance : amber/orange in color - almost like a very dark apple cider color . hazy/cloudy . no head / no lacing . aroma : citrus and bourbon are immediate on the nose w/ the bourbon being much stronger . smells sweet but very boozy . a touch of maple flavor in the nose as well . almost sherry like ? mouthfeel : thicker than expected and syrupy . leaves almost a film like feeling around the mouth . taste : not nearly as boozy in taste as i expected after smelling it . carmel , wheat and citrus are all strong flavors in this brew . so strong that they are almost competeing to be the strongest . a strong bourbon flavor is there as well - easily my favorite of the flavors present in this . this is a pretty intense beer ! overbearing is a word that comes to mind . overall : i 'm not a fan of this beer - but in it 's defense , i 'm not a fan of this style of beer . i do appreciate it and understand the following it has earned - which is well deserved . i much perfer the style of the 2010 nemesis .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.60 0.50	a : pours a nice macro-golden color with a thin head that soon dissipates into nothing . very minimal lacing on this one . s : ipa ? yeah right . pale ale ? only if i 'm being generous . this is the worst nose on an ipa i 've ever encountered . sweet malts dominate . t : very sweet in the beginning followed by a wave of slight bitterness . the taste is n't as awkward as the smell but it 's still not pleasant . my buddy described this as `` an overhopped kristallweizen , or maybe a scotch ale designed by a simian with an ibu fetish . '' i could n't agree more . m & d : a tad under carbonated but drinks relatively easy . i do n't know what to make of this one . would n't turn it down in a pinch , and might score it better if it was n't labeled an ipa . definitely a unique brew that 's worth a try .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	22 oz bottle purchased at bruisin ales . poured into a 22 oz terrapin snifter . a : pours a extremely dark brown with ruby highlights around the edges . nice looking cocoa colored head that didnt last very long before settling to a ring . that ring leaves a little bit of lacing . s : this beer smells incredible . huge vanilla aroma that is mixed with a huge coffee aroma . there is a bit of roasted malt aroma in the background as well . t : coffee seems a bit more prominent in the flavor but the vanilla is still the star of the show . there was a bit of a boozy kick that seemed to become less aggressive as it warmed up . m : unbelievably smooth and creamy in the mouth . perfect carbonation level . medium to thick body . d : after letting it warm just a bit more , it was much easier to drink because the alcohol edge seemed to mellow . for a 10 % big flavored beer like this , it still disappears faster than you would expect .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	pours a solid/bright golden color with a two finger white head . the head dissipated pretty rapidly , which is expected because of the abv . aromas of honey and sweet malts , some beligan yeats notes as well . the oakiness is barely present . smells a little like white grape wine . the taste starts off with some sugary/white white flavors but then the alcohol shows up a little . finishes with a little more honey sweetness . i think this beer is good but a little too much like a white white and the flavors dont totally work together and seem to fight with one another . beer starts out thick and solid and still finishes fairly dry because of the oak aging presumabley . definitely a sipper , kinda hard to finish actually . this is a weak example of a summer , after-dinner , sitting around sort of beer .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	i think this is guinness . i have spent many an evening sitting in bars in the middle east . they often have both guinness and kilkenny on tap . often i will order one of each at the same time and alternate sips between the two brews . most of the flavors , feel , and appearance are identical . think of a nice malt being toasted . stop at the point where it is a nice dark gold to red color and make kilkenny . keep toasting it until it is black and almost burnt or charcoal and make guinness . when you make this beer do everything exactly the same just change how much you toast the malt . to me i like the dark toast flavor and color of kilkenny the best . still i would not want it every time and like the stronger charcoal taste in guinness every once in awhile . the taps for kilkenny say it is brewed by guinness . i have never seen this fact in any of the reviews or notes on the web site . i just finished reading a history of guinness . it notes that southwicks brewery has been owned by guinness since 1956 . it also noted that guinness has applied their nitrogenation process to this brew . that is what gives guinness the nice cream color when pored and solid head . i think they applied more than that . i have got to start looking for it in the us when i get home .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	pours a nice amber . smell is robust and lovely . big pumpkin spice flavor with cinnamon and nutmeg seeming evident . taste is very thin , muted and watery , but the pumpkin flavor that shows is still nice . very pumpkin pie like in the flavor that is there . drinkable , nice attempt , that would be great with a big more boldness .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	on tap at creation cafe . poured a wonderfully deep burnished bronze with wonderful head and some decent lacing throughout . huge deep malty scents , with lots of caramel and toffee and a nixe bit of earthiness , as well . great huge sweet malty flavor , thick and deep with ( in order ) caramel , toffee , peat , and licorice flavors and a nice earthy hop finish . thick with a bit of alcohol heat , this is an excellent and warming wee heavy .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60	a - a big fat solid two finger head charges to the top of the brew and stays put for a long time . the tan head is creamy , solid , and dense . it almost looks like that foamy spray insulation that can be used to coat industrial spaces . there is a white layer of cream on top of the tan foam ... thats something that i 've never seen before ; a two tones head ! the brew itself is pitch black with the lightest hints of brown around the edge when held directly to the snow-blinding light outside my sliding door . lots of sparkling lace sticks to the snifter , and a quick swirl brings the head back to a full two fingers . s - sweet creamy milk chocolate , gooey nougat filling that you might find in chocolate coated candy , sweet welch 's grape juice , laffy taffy assorted flavors , and plums . this is ridiculously complex ... i 'm getting some pureed plum or prune baby food , hints of mashed bananas , and a tiny whiff of brandy . t - again , mashed overripe fruit like you might taste in a little jar of baby food . there is also a very obvious alcohol component that is an integrated part of the flavor . this one is a bit to sweet imo , and it would do better with more massive hops and a bit less sugar . m - full bodied and viscous . this has the feeling of mashed baby food in the mouth . carbonation is graciously understated , and some alcohol warmth is apparent . creamy initially , the feel fades to a nice warm touch of booze before finishing on the sweeter side . lots of sugars coat the mouth here . d - not the best baltic porter ever , but it 's not bad . could be a great dessert beer , but it 's just to damn sweet for regular drinking . i like the nose , but the flavors are far less complex and fail to deliver the variety of notes that i smell .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	had this on-tap at the miami location . beer was poured into proper glassware ( weizen glass ) . a : this hefe was off to a bad start . the beer had a yellow lemonish color that was n't as cloudy or heavy looking as most of the good hefes i 've tried in the past . nice looking two finger white head but it dissipated really quick , boo . some lacing was present . s : this is where things started to improve . smell was very enjoyable with lots of wheat , lemon , banana , and hints of honey . thumbs up . t : followed the nose nicely with touches of wheat , lemon and banana that are felt in the tongue as soon as you sip the beer . it ends with a bit of an acidic taste , but nothing offensive . m : light body leaning towards medium . a bit watery but not in a bad way , makes the beer feel crisp and fresh . o : this beer was a bit confusing . i usually like my hefes to be on the heavier body side but this was very enjoyable as it was . the lightness and watery feel are definitely uncharacteristic of the style but this beer does a good job in making it feel right . the good smell and taste made up for the weak appearance .

0.40 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.80	from a 22 ounce bomber this poured out with a considerable amount of murk and chunk . a thin film of a head topped the beer off . orange amber in color and full of floating particulates . hmmm is this supposed to be like this ? it has been in the fridge for a few months . am i talking to myself ? the aroma is very appealing . sweet hoppy fruit notes , strawberry licorice , apricot nectar . very nice . taste is bold and bittersweet . nice balance . heavy malt is kept in check by the bitter hops , and prominently grapefruit rinds . flavors up and becomes increasingly bitter as the beer warms . overall , this is an enjoyable ipa . nicely balanced , maybe a bit rough around the edges , but the overall flavor makes up for that .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70	bought this guy at the dfh brewery in de . poured a color i ca n't really explain . depending on how it was held up to the light , it was red , orange , gold , brown or even pink . the foamy white head was small and left little lacing on the glass . the smell was extrememly complex ; sour cherry , vanilla , honey come out first and then caramel malts and dark frutits as it warms . excellent . sweet and sour fruits cominate the taste , but caramel malts creep slowly in , along with alcohol , honey , and even some wood . there is n't much initial 'bite ' in the mf , but rather a mild sweetness fades to something alittle more bitter . the feel ends up pleasantly sweet and smooth . although it is masked relatively well , the abv does make this a sipping beer . still a great and interesting berw ; things i have come to expect and enjoy from dfh .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	as the beer was poured , i became curious of this beer . there was a slight chill haze through the copper colored beer . at first i was disappointed by the head retention but my second beer had much more retention . i 'm assuming that my first glass was n't the cleanest . as far as smell goes , uh ... .there was n't much to mention . i could smell some hop fragrance but it really did n't stand out as exceptional to me . but my sniffer goes wacky after surfing so that may have played a part in it . . taste was where i was impressed . this beer was delicious . i was amazed at how flavorful it was and even more amazed at how my damn tongue went numb in 1 minute . the balance worked nicely with the amount of alcohol . mouthfull was really light for what i 'm assuming was a very high initial gravity . it went down easy and definitely played a role in this beers drinkability , along with taste . the only downfall is that i had way too many of these in a short amount of time . this is not something you can drink 5 of and mow the lawn . well , i guess you can but the lawn is n't going to come out too good .

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	thanks to cmmcdonn for sending me this awesome beer ! poured a beautiful copper color with a white 1.5 finger head that settled rather quickly but leaves some nice sticky lace . a=incredible aromas of citrus fruits , grapefruit , pineapple , orange , and some sweet malts round this out . i could smell this glass forever , except for the fact that my mouth is watering in anticipation . t=again getting some grapefruit and pineapple flavors with a nice sweet malt backbone to balance it out . now , this beer is good , really good , but from the aroma , i really expected much more from this . does n't quite live up to the initial aromas for some reason . m=nice medium , creamy . o=this is a really great beer , excellent in fact . i would purchase this on the regular if it were available to me .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.70	at $ 7.99 for a 12-pack , i felt i had to try it . a : pours a clear medium yellow with a thin white head that quickly vanishes s : hints of malt and corn , but weak overall t : simple basic lager taste that does not attract attention , neither too sweet nor too bitter m : smooth and easy on the tongue - moderately carbonated and well behaved d : easy to enjoy several , but may get a bit boring this would probably be a decent beer to enjoy on a hot day , with a sandwich and some chips . at the current , price i may buy more .

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.60 0.70	very little aroma from the glass , but looks darn purdy ! dry finish , very light flavors of roasted coffee beans , some malt , little hops , though quite dry . rather thin for a stout , went well with my stilton burger . a nice enough example of a dry stout .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	continuing with the `` blue '' theme ... 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass . pours a crystal clear pale yellow . this looks just like a macro lager . 2 fingers worth of white foamy froth on top . little retention . the nose is bursting with fresh blueberries . very sweet nose reminds me of waffles , muffins , cereal with its grainy like finish . i dig it . the mouth is carbonated decently enough . a thinner beer that is meant to be gulped rather than sipped . the blueberries are n't as dominating in the flavor as they are in the aroma . buttered bread , toast , tart fruity quality . undetectable bitterness . blueberry aftertaste . this is not bad , heck , i actually want some more . when in the mood for a fruit 'n malt concoction , i 'd reach for this again .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	330ml bottle poured into tulip april,3 2011 a a murky dark amber with just enough clarity that i could see the bubbles popping of the bottom of the glass , big ass soapy dark tan head falls fairly quickly leaving only a few patches of lace s mellow smokey , woody , earthy goodness , some vanilla , toffee and perhaps some plum with just a little booze but i 'd never believe it was 13.8 % . it smells awesome , everything works together and you get something else every whiff no issues here t much more booze then the nose , more toffee , smoke , and fruit with some burnt brown sugar , still very nice but without as much balance m enters silky then the bubbles make it feel creamy , quite thick and the flavors linger , the heat lingers too and that 's my only complaint in this area o for a big fresh barley wine i thought it was pretty good , the barrel agings there but not overpowering and its oh so mellow i was hoping this one would suck so i would n't need to buy a couple of them to age , pretty expensive but this would be amazing after some time , pretty mellow considering the 13.8 % fresh i can only imagine this 5 years down the road

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	a- shiny copper color and transparent . nice head leaves clumps and patterns of lacing s- faint odor of hard water and some sweet , pale malts . becomes more noticeably spicy as it warms t- taste is top-notch . bitter fuggle flavors are more typical of a british pale ale . balanced perfectly along a light , pale backbone . slightly salty ? m- silky smooth carbonation and light body d- session ?

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	poured into my pint glass the beer is crystal clear red-orange . about one inch of tan head rises to the top and almost escapes . no lacing is left behind after settling . the aroma is spicy with loads of malt and touch of hops . the nose is spot on with what i think a marzen should smell like . the flavor is quite spicy . maybe too much spice . very bready . sweet and malty with just touch of hops on the finish . medium to light body with mild carbonation . overall a decent marzen . a bit too spicy for my tastes . i 'm glad we are almost through with the fall seasonals . i think i 'm about done with this style for a bit .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60	had this at a christmas party where i think it is intended to be had . poured dark although i did not know what to expect . the description read like a dunkelweizen with some spices . this beer had a very faint smell . upon tasting a found very little hops or spice and nothing that felt like a wheat beer . smooth like all sam adams products but not much else .

0.70 0.40 0.80 0.80 1.00	this stout had a thin foamy head and black/extremely dark brown in color . the aromas were really weak and could not get much character from it except the malts . the taste on the other hand had a strong peppermint taste which was great . unfortunately there was not much else to it except the peppermint taste . it went down really light a slightly thicker in density than water which made it really easy to drink . i seriously could down many of these in one sitting .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	my first reaction was `` this tastes like shitty coffee '' i then drank the bottle , let it warm , smelled it , swished it around and tried to enjoy , but in the end it still tasted like shitty coffee . folgers type stuff ... i probably wont buy another bottle , there are better coffee style beers that i can enjoy for the same or less money .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	poured into a darkness snifter . saw this on the shelves near its release and always went back and forth on the price despite wanting to try it . when it disappeared and i randomly came across a refrigerated batch i figure it was time to give it a shot . the nose on this is so deep and sweet , with a nice thinner and less smooth look but tasty looking none the less -- i was sure i would n't be disappointed . ultimately it 's hard to rate this as i just get such a noxious rubbing alcohol like taste ( though strangely without much heat sensation ) . it 's really at the core of the beer and it makes it hard to enjoy . i 'd claim quality control or something , but the store i picked it up at is great for controlling their quality . i just do n't know what to say about the beer with such a noxious quality .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.20 0.40	i 'm probably doing an unnecessary step in pouring this into an elegant duvel tulip but i guess i can try to get as much as i can out of this beer . pours a light golden white wine color with a soapy looking white head that rises to the brim . leaves decent lacing . smell is rampant with orange peel , though there are hints of spice and yeast twang . the taste is phenomenally underwhelming , it tastes like light beer . this literally tastes like carbonated mineral water with a pinch of sour orange . the mouthfeel is average and the drinkability low . this is an `` elegant '' chugging beer . at 6.50 a 6 pack it is n't worth it as an `` elegant '' chugger .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	another great beer from denmark , this little country is no slouch in craft beer world.poured into an imperial nonic a near jet black except from some chocolate brown highlights when held to the light , a large blooming lighter mocha colored head atop.to me the aromas couldnt get any better , a fantastic display of chocolate and resiny hop , maybe the best aroma of any stout i have come across , if you like the hops no matter the style its spot on.the mouthfeel is a little sharp and not as full on as i would have liked.bitter chocolate , dark fruit , and a healthy dose of resiny hop make for a well rounded flavor profile , if that mouthfeel was just a little more smooth ! a really good beer that is close to being great , love the hop play going on .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.40	surprised that there was a cork under that large bottle cap ! it popped like i was opening a champagne . even before i finished pouring the glass my nose was overwhelmed with dark cherry aromas that almost made my mouth water . the smell was deep and lustrous , with only the slightest hint that i was holding a beer . some alcohol . the dense red cap of bubbles refused to break apart as i swirled the beer around to release more of that luxurious cherry smell . the beer is dark red through and through . i have to admit that i was slightly shocked ( but not necessarily disappointed ) that this did not taste like beer . the cherry taste was even more intense than the aroma . the cherries were bolstered by an overwhelming sweetness that is appropriate in champagne or kool aid , but not in beer . but then again this was not really a beer . it was closer to a champagne than a beer . this `` kriek '' stands on its own because it is unique in its intense fruitiness . i happen to love the cherries but there was simply too much sugary sweetness present to make me want to buy another .

0.50 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.40	bottle inspection : born on 10nov06 ( dd58 ? ) sampled 01jan07 , lists 6 % , imported hops , bourbon barrels , and madagascar vanilla beans . aroma : first whiff is wet wood , some alcohol spice , and some dark malt . appearance : painfully clear amber glass tries to hold a head but only manages a collar . flavor : vanilla pops right out , a bit heavy handed dominating all other tastes . very difficult to get much more out of it ; some mild bourbon taste is noted in the malt background . mouthfeel : fizzy and thin . overall impression : yawn . bold tastes boiled down to not offend the masses . vanilla is a bit too strong , im glad i dont have the 6er to deal with .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	thanx patyoda held up to the light , this is far from clear but gives off a dark crimson fuzzy glow without shining through . interesting . not much head , thin ring is all . buttery nut aroma . beery . mild . flavor is a subdued mix of caramel and chocolate.. no off flavors , no extreme bitterness , no sourness . this is probably the smoothest and most drinkable dark beer i have ever encountered . burnt sugar flavor without being sweet . nutty without extreme bitterness . slight hint of wheat or something fresh and crisp in this beer.. slightly botanical and this gives the beer a basic edge and counterpoint to the silkiness . hard to describe , but very likeable without stepping outside of the box . perfect session german . will try this again , would probably be something stellar on tap .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70	the first thing that hits me about this beer is that i can smell flowery hops off the pour and i do n't even have the glass to my nose yet . i poured it on the counter top and the hop aroma was strong enough for me to smell it from 2 feet away ! this prompted me to lift the glass to my nose to get a good sniff . the aroma is very nice , mostly of flowery american hops , but there is some underlying citrus as well . it is a very well blended hop profile , with the flowery hops , and the citrus is a nice combination of some grapefruit , lemon , and a small bit of sweet orange and a hint of pine . aside from the hop aroma , you get a sweet malt aroma as well , mostly caramel and not much else . but this is evidence that there will be enough malt to support the hops in this one . i almost forgot the appearance in this one , because the aroma stole the show . the beer poured a real nice dense head that lasted for several minutes . the beer is a dark golden amber color with some haze probably from dry hopping . flavor is where this beer leaves me just a little bit . do n't get me wrong it is very good , and quite large which is what it should be , but it appears to be a bit out of balance for my taste . the hop flavor is complex and incredible . there is some hints of pine and grapefruit and just a thick juicy hop cone sitting right in your mouth . how great is that ? pretty great i would say . but there is just a little something off in the finish . the bitterness is ok , but it is so tongue coating that it leaves an impression of chalky dryness . the malt is very nice , with a sweet and soft caramel flavor that starts off balancing the hops nicely until the hops just beats the crap out of it . you can obviously taste the alcohol in this beer as well , not only in just the nose , but the flavor as well . this style should be very hop assertive , which it is , but i think that one of the hop choices may not sit so well the beer . i do n't want you to get me wrong , this beer is a very good example of an imperial ipa and i am enjoying it . i have had pliney the elder , and although it is almost as enjoyable as it 's inspiration , it just falls a touch short .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.70	this is a local beer and i drink it often at the brewhouse . on-tap or in the bottle it tastes the same . this seems to really be an american version of a belgian white , so while that might set the standard it really has to be rated simply as a witbier it pours a cloudy yellow with a moderate white foamy head the does not last long . the nose is most distinctly citrus and coriander . mouthfeel is surprisingly robust for the type . flavor is spicy and really refreshing . the main thing you can say about this beer is that it is good to drink . or maybe you can say it tastes more like a summer spice beer . when i first started drinking craftbrews i rated this pretty high , but now i have to rate it above average but not outstanding .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.80	a lawnmower ipa ? appearance is light straw color , not the copper orange i am used to with other ipas . smell is clean , crisp piney cascades . taste is quite light for an ipa . closer to an apa then an ipa . not much malt flavor , but not out of balance either . mouthfeel is average for an ipa . drinkability is good in that it is a `` lawnmower '' ipa . also , a good gateway ipa for those ramping up to bigger beers . overall , a decent brew , but not the ipa i prefer .

0.80 0.30 0.50 0.30 0.30	a- almost black , just a shade under . tons of small bubbles , 3 '' head into a tulip with a very easy pour . s- not sure what infection smells like but i think i know now . after a few sniffs i got some coffee but mostly it was a wierd smell ( that was not good ) . t- ugg , not good , first taste was bad , no typical stout flavoring , just badness m- for what little i could drink the mouthfeel was okay . o- unfortunate find in the beer aisle . i can not imagine this is how it is suppose to taste but for a non barrel aged beer there is no excuse for what is hopefully an infected bottle . no more laughing dog for me .

1.00 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.70	bottle courtesy of cpferris . thanks ! poured into an alesmith pint glass . tawny pumpkin color with a splendid off-white head . great retention and insane lacing , sheets of foam everywhere . aroma is caramel malt with a deep hop citrus juiciness . honeydew and mandarine orange notes . this beer is really really really hoppy . the flavor starts with a boozy caramel/honey note that lulls you into thinking this beer might be balanced , but then a warhead full of hops detonates . grapefruit zest provides a little sweetness but a big piney bitterness hits . the finish is long , warm , and bitter . mouthfeel is sticky and oily . body and carbonation are fine . alcohol is apparent but melded into the malt profile so as to not be astringent or hot .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70	sampled march 2007 this is a very dark brew , it is quite opaque and is quite black as it sits in my glass . it is topped by a billowing , easily three-finger thick , light chocolate brown colored head . ah , the aroma is so nicely roasted ; smelling of chocolate , espresso , lightly roasted coffee , a touch of burnt grain husks . it has this underlying , but always evident , decadent dark malt note that makes it smell like a lightly sweet , dense , dark dessert ; perhaps a dessert that is a mix of chocolate and coffee , but there is an unmistakable , complex malty sweetness here in the aroma as well . this just smells so decadent . up front the aroma smells quite burnt & perhaps a touch sharp , but it quickly picks up a richness that is just so compelling ; this is certainly a beer that i can easily spend a few minutes sampling just the aroma . the first sip hits my tongue , at first it seems a bit lighter in the body than i was expecting . a roast acidity seems to lighten the effect of this brew , but then the malt kicks in and this brew becomes quite chewy and rich , just like the aroma promised . it starts out with roasted coffee & barley malt notes , then picks up notes of chocolate and darkened malt sugars . it finishes with a lingering sweet notes reminiscent of sweet dark chocolate and a touch of espresso acidity . as my palate gets used to this brew it seems to lose a bit of that initial richness , perhaps the burnt acidity becomes a bit too acrid for the other competing flavors to compete with . it is still quite tasty , though i might recommend not drinking this on an empty stomach , the acidity seems to be causing me some , though extremely mild , stomach discomfort . while the flavor is quite nice , i think that the aroma is better ; it is richer and fuller , with a better complexity to it . if the complete beer lived up to the initial aroma this beer would be just about perfect . the mouthfeel of this seemed to fizzle a bit after the first couple of sips . ultimately this is a great beer , it is just that after the first couple of sips this promised to be a stunning beauty of beer ; or perhaps better said is started out so decadent and rich , but then took on a lighter tone . as most beer geeks know , it is better to have the lighter less powerful beers first in a session and move one 's way up to the more powerful brews ; not the other way around like this brew seems to do . as it is though , it is still a great beer , one which i would be happy to have easy access to .

1.00 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	since i have been a member of this site for a while now and have n't reviewed anything , i figured it was time . a bottle poured slightly vigorously into my victoy tulip glass . a nice tan head formed and lingered . a- the appearance is nice and dark . it looks black in the shadows , but once held up in some light appears a gorgeous dark brown/red . s- not getting much smell . brew is a little too cold as it was in my basement . t- the taste of this beer is good . the initial flavor is a malty , somewhat sweet one , but rather quickly the hops bite in and deliver some good contrast with a nice pine bitterness . alcohol flavor is detectable if you search for it . the aftertaste is a nice bitterness with no traces of the semi-sweet flavor i got when i first sip . m- the mf feels a little creamy . not overly carbonated and not under carbonated . very nice . d- this is a very drinkable beer . the hops and malts are nicely balanced . the higher alcohol content is warming and comforting . as with most victory products , i think this is a great beer . very enjoyable and pleasing to the palate . could sit around and suck on these for a quite a while .

0.70 0.20 0.30 0.30 0.20	12 oz can . appearance : looks pretty good . a clear , dark ruby , almost purple . the head is light brown without much retention . good looking beer i guess , but not for a belgian dark . smell : ugh . is this a sour . smells like vinegar . sour cherries and vinegar . taste : tart and vinegary . i get the sense that there 's an ok beer behind it all . mouthfeel : cant even tell . i need to wash my mouth out . drinkability : pouring it . i tried to give it chance and kept tasting it over an hour or so . this seems like a different beer than what everyone else is reviewing , so i assume this is a bad can . how `` can '' that be ?

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	reviewed from notes . pours dark brown with a light head and not too much lace , but a sufficient amount not to get docked . nose is quite complex with some really nice notes of oak , vanilla , chocolate , roasted malt , and some light coffee . the taste does n't mix these together quite as well , but is still tasty . great feel coming from all different directions and quite drinkable for the big beer that it is .

1.00 0.50 0.90 0.70 0.80	bottle 707/1104 . poured into a delirium tremens tulip . half inch dark beige head the dies down to a ring of foam with some specs of foam in the middle of the surface . oily legs and some lacing left behind . pitch black body . lots of spicy oak . smells of rich dark fruits like cherries , raisins and plumbs . a touch of chocolate and then some wet cardboard oxidation in there as well . the beer does n't smell all that strong . tastes of tons of dark fruits ( cherries/raisins/figs/plumbs ) up front . then there are some whispers of dark chocolate that are immediately taken over by vanilla , oak and bourbon . there is also some piney hoppiness and an unpleasant wet cardboard note suggesting some oxidation . luckily the wet cardboard note is pretty faint . the mouthfeel on this one is quite thick and a touch syrupy . coating . good carbonation . some heat as well . pretty good drinkability .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.50	this beer was pretty good until the hard city water aroma and flavour kicked in . they really need to take care of their water problem .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	this finest beer of the world , as in , wherever you travel in the world it is the one beer that will be available that you know is good . i have a certain nostalgic love affair with this beer . heineken is the beer that taught me that beer is n't supposed to be light , lite , or have odd nicknames like `` the beast '' or `` natty '' i have drank this beer all over europe during my travels , while of course trying many other beers . it 's always rock solid predictably good . the taste is always crisp with a little bit of carbonation . it 's light and easy to drink but flavorful on the front of the tongue and the back . i do n't drink heineken all the time , but when i do it is always perfect .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	it 's neat to have a bottle encourage me to pour the beer quickly into my glass . i 'm a busy man , dammit , and putting an extra 5 seconds between and intoxication could result in the loss of a business deal , or pissing off one of my clients , or failing to close a merger at 6.5 % . that 's not how mynie works . i 'm a winner , baby . i 'll give it left hand ; the beer actually does the downward-floating bubbles thing that widget beers do , and its head is gigantic . it do n't smell all that strong or sweet , even for the style this seems little tame . light nodes of dark roasted barley . that 's it . tastes a god sight better . it 's very nitro creamy , and that accentuates a sweet beginning of chocolate and maltodextrin , which moves into a bittersour roasted barely and ends on a combination of light , dry hops and lingering milk sugar . mouthfeel is superb .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	on tap poured into a pint glass . pours a nice slightly hazy golden color with almost no head but some nice light lacing . nose is very light but a bit hoppy . taste is very crisp and refreshing with a light hop bite on the finish . mouthfeel is sharp and smooth with a sulfur taste that i ready like .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70	22oz . bomber poured into a tulip-style glass . it pours a medium copper color with three fingers of head that dies off rather quickly . there 's almost no lacing . the smell is fruity and spicy . there 's a little bit of a citrus character , and some peppery aromas as well . the taste was very spicy , but not in a good way . the spices really clash , and you just ca n't help but feel that something is n't right . plus the flavor just drops off . the mouthfeel is very spritzy , but it 's also watery as well . the drinkability suffers a little as well . definately not what i would expect from rogue .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.30 0.20	pours out to a sparkingly clear light amber , forming a small off-white head with average retention and lacing . carbonation is moderate . the aroma is very similar to heineken with my eyes closed ... faint grassiness , floral hops , clean lager ferment , but with a touch of caramel and toffee . the mouthfeel is bright and crisp at first but finishes very ruddy with a twang of wet cardboard and some higher alcohols . medium bodied . the taste begins with a nice blend of grassy hops and delicate pale malts , but is followed by greasy caramel , vegetable oil , and cardboard . the aftertaste is somewhat acrid and i feel a headache coming on from this one . bitterness is mild . i would pass on this one . it has promise but ends horriby . i do n't think i 'm going to be able to finish this bottle . ugh .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.40	dark brown with a bit of a reddish hue when held to the light , about one finger thick head in the pour left tight lacing on the glass sweet caramel and coffee notes gives a little burnt coffee favor , sweetness counteracted by a little sour . a little thin on the mouth especially for a porter , sour hop bitterness quite strong . this poured and smelled like a porter but drinking did n't really feel like a porter .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	i was driving up to lake tahoe over labor day weekend last summer , and stopped off at a raley 's in auburn to pick up lunch . i usually like to peruse the beer aisle when i 'm in `` foreign '' grocery stores , hoping to snag a hard-to-find favorite , or otherwise something unfamiliar but enticing . browsing the unusually deep selection , i came upon a label i did n't recognize , and whose tribal designs recalled those printed on peet 's coffee cups . on closer inspection i discovered a style and manufacturer i 'd never experienced . examining the bottle further , i discovered it was `` brewed and bottled for knee deep beer company by beer4u , belmont , california . '' this amused me , because i 'd just moved from belmont after living there the previous two years , but had no recollection of either company . it was an snap decision to purchase the tanilla porter , but finding the right occasion to crack it open took significantly more discretion and patience . typically , when i select a bottle with the intention of enjoying it solo , i opt for something a bit more conventional , a known quantity , avoiding my one-of-a-kind bottles in favor of something i can more easily replenish . i had more or less decided to hang on to the tanilla until i could share it as an after-dinner beer with friends . unfortunately , i have n't had too many dinners with beer-drinking friends in the last few months . first , i was occupied with moving-related tasks , and then i was busy with rehearsals for a play that ran in november , and then before you knew it , the holidays were upon us ... for various reasons , i decided that my new year 's resolution would be to stop buying beer for my home collection . even though i decided this in december , i more or less forgot to stockpile `` everyday '' beers when i had the chance , and so i entered 2012 with precious few session beers on hand ( mostly leftover bottles of stella from a recent party ) . the other night , i was in the mood for a post-dinner tipple , decided what the hell , and poured myself a luscious mug of sweetly aromatic tanilla . i must confess that the tasting experience peaked just as ( no , not before ) the first sip of rich porter coated the insides of my mouth . it 's not that i did n't like the tanilla , do n't misunderstand me . it 's just that the inviting smell which drew my lips closer to the glass was in itself the ultimate reward after months of anticipation . now , perhaps i had built it up so much for myself that anything less than an instantaneous bufotenin surge would have come off as anticlimactic . perhaps . all i know is that as soon as my taste buds registered the tanilla 's presence , i knew that the wait was over . reality was upon me . it was , after all , just a fucking beer as for getting into the specifics of mouthfeel , color , viscosity , and all that , i leave those details to other beer advocate reviewers , and will close by saying that this beer did not disappoint me . far from it , actually . and if i learned anything from the experience , it 's that i need to recruit a few friendly volunteers to help bring me back down to earth a little bit , and drink my beer with me in a more timely fashion , so i do n't obsess too much about finding the perfect time to open this bottle or that one . i would n't even mind reloading with a fresh bottle of tanilla to share with friends -- in 2013 , of course .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	on tap at brugge brasserie on april 4 , 2011 . served a little too cold in a stemmed goblet . a : deep amber with pink highlights . creamy pink head that leaves haphazard lacing clinging to the glass . hazy and effervescent . s : the serving temp hurts aroma . light notes of tart berries , perhaps tart cherry and raspberry . a little sourness tickles the nose . t : sweet berries begin , but tart berries take over . not a prickly sourness . again , i ca n't make out particular berries , but cherry , raspberry and unripe strawberries are implied . m : creamy and medium-bodied . finishes reasonably dry . somewhat astringent . d : pookah is a competent interpretation of the style and easy-drinking , to boot . i wish i could buy a growler of it .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50	$ 5 for this bottle . it poured a hazy yellow color with a minimal white head . pleasant citrus aroma , but also a pronounced herbal presence , which was a little bit jarring . things went downhill from there . there was some lemon , a fair amount of thyme and rosemary , and a big , huge dose of garlic . i felt like i had just eaten some scampi or other heavily garlicked meal , and was breathing garlic . the garlic and herbs made for a sharply unpleasant mouthfeel . wo n't drink this again .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.90	this ale has taken leaps and bounds from what it once was with a kick ass cascade injection . the dry-hopping gives it a fantastic smell , citrusy and piney . the flavor holds it 's hop flavor , but the hops are just perfectly balanced . a great american amber ale well worth trying if you are actually all the way up in oscoda ( and do n't already know ) . my only complaint is that you basically have to throw something at the wait staff behind the bar who are usually not present for 5-10 minutes at a time .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	a : pours pale golden , almost straw-colored . the white head starts off really tall and thick but quickly sinks into decent lacings . s : surprisingly grainy for a german pilsener , and almost a bit corny . some sweet malt . bitter hops , but way too modest . its more like a macro euro pale lager than a german pilsener . t : that was better ; more bitter hops to balance the malt . way less grain and not any sign of corn . mild taste , but not unpleasant . m : aftertaste is short and bitter . body is light and carbonation medium . smooth . o : well , this one was all over the place ; the smell reminded of euro pale lager , the taste was more like german pilsener but way to mild . and aftertaste was very short . very drinkable , anyway .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.40	maybe i 'm just not a scotch ale person , but i did n't like this beer . color started off nice , reddish brown pour . smoky , peat moss kind of smell . the barrel aging taste that comes through with the malt was largely unsatisfying - like someone had spilled some bourbon in my beer . for me , the drinkability was n't there - i can see sampling this one in a 2 oz . taster to appreciate the style , but not more than that .

0.90 0.80 0.20 0.30 0.20	a-black , thin light tan head s-surprisingly i 'm not picking up not much more than a light hint of sweet potato , and possibly some cream . very very unique for stout t-i 'm getting some coffee notes with a sweet potato after-taste but more than anything this beer is just watery . it is absolutely a terrible stout . i 'm not sure what kind of beer you 're wanting to drink if you enjoy this . if you 're expecting a stout or anything that resembles one , this beer will disappoint you . m-i do n't think there is actually any carbonation . it goes down more like orange juice . d-not drinkable whatsoever . only my respect for beer kept me from spilling this down the drain .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.50	a- a slightly hazy yellow color with a thin but creamy white head that has some decent retention . not nearly as cloudy as i expected for a wit . s- sweet , candy berry aroma and a bit of biscuity malt . smells surprisingly good . the berry aroma really stands out here and is not what i would call subtle like the label implies . t- shockingly and cloyingly sweet . this is by far the sweetest beer i have ever encountered . i was really pleased with the aroma , but this is just way too much . this is like blackberry soda . m- for as soda like as the flavor is , the mouthfeel is surprisingly nice . a good carbonation level , but that stickiness is really drying . d- way too sweet , but once you get past that ... nevermind , i ca n't get past it . i think they could have done with a little less blackberry and a little more wit .

0.50 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.40	damn that bottle was hard to open . a : somewhat british looking beer . very nice reddish copper ale , fully translucent with light beige head . retention is poor as well as lacing . s : strong smell . definitely strong malt backbone . there are caramel and biscuit-y malts in this . malty sweetness includes : caramel , molasses , brown sugar and vanilla . there are strong fruits in this : very sweet orange juice , red apples , sweet beet juice , red grapes and pears . also strong spices : cloves , cinnamon , light pepper , coriander and ginger . finally , hops : light pineapple , lemon and floral notes . complex and powerful . just short of mind blowing . t : hoppier than expected . there are quite good amounts of earthy hops , bitter lemon and very light pineapple . sadly , too much hops for the sake of this beer and not enough residual sugars . the malt tastes are : very dry molasses , vanilla , roasted malts , very toasted bread . still fruity , but just dry and not sweet : strong bitter oranges , dry apple taste . someone mentioned woody tannins , and there seems to have a lot in this , which also kills a bit the beer ( but i would guess they come from the bitter oranges ) without the needed sugars . the spices are still there too : cloves , cinnamon , light pepper , coriander and ginger . just try to think about cola without any kind of sweetening . lots of good ideas , just not done as well as expected after the fantastic smell of the beer . m : medium feel , but very dry because of all the tannins coming from the bitter oranges ( i think ) with medium carbonation . somewhat unique feel , but not in a very positive way . d : tannins and hops imbalance kill this one , needs more sugars to be correctly balanced and then drinkable . sadly , this is the first trois-mousquetaires that i do n't really enjoy . it is their first time doing this beer and i 'm positive next year will have what i look into this beer to be ( imo ) much better .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	i reviewed this beer once several years back , and have been puzzled why my scores were so utterly different from other reviewers . with much , much more beer under my belt ( so to speak ) , i sat down to try this beer again . to control for any bias from previous experience or the reviews of others , i tasted this beer blindly . a : dense , black beer with a sticky , caramel head s : malts and dense fruits are the main thing i smell ... sweet , but not overpowering . very nice . t : everything indicated by the nose was delivered in a very lush , balanced flavor . m : thick at first , but carbonation is sufficient to balance it . sticky , though not unpleasant finish . d : i do n't particularly find stouts very drinkable , but this is better than most .

0.90 0.60 1.00 1.00 1.00	bought a single bottle at a local bottle shop ... had a gab award paitned on the bottle so i thought what the hell ... it is stone and a gab winner ! poured a dark orangish brown , great balance of citrus hops and a roasted malt . got to say for a stone beer this is very drinklable . would buy more when i am looking to session a great craft beer .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70	not a bad fruit beer but defintley need to be refined a bit . not much of a head . fairly fizzy but so is blue paw . has a nice raspberry smell which is not overly strong . i was dissapointed in the flavor of the beer . the blue paw has a stong smell and a fairly strong flavor with a lasting blueberry aftertaste . so i expected the same . i was dissapointed to find the raspberry flavor was kinda hidden and did n't linger in the aftertaste . not a bad raspberry beer but better ones are out there . tt3

0.80 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.20	can you dig it ? i discovered another can of beer to try . `` `` hold it down ! '' what , is that some sort of defiant gesture to goad me to try ? f**k you , doggy ! i just had a pitcher of something arrogant enough to call me a bastard and say that i am unworthy . you think that i am scared of you ? ! ? back to your stinking kennel and stay there ! the nice thing about these macros is their head . i produced a solid two fingers ' worth of dense , bone-white head with excellent retention off of the pour . the nose , on the other hand , smelled like liquid death . it smelled like a can of gasoline left out to near its flash point . fusel alcohol to the max ! oof . the color was another winner . it had a beautiful shade of golden yellow with ne-quality clarity . the mouthfeel reminded me of the last scene in `` what we do is secret '' when darby crash realizes that he 's gone a bit too far , but there is no turning back from the inevitable . his was a heroin overdose , mine was a stomach-wrenching sensation followed by a strange mellowness and a desire for another hit , i mean , swig . powerful stuff . this was no playing around , certainly not meant for amateurs , and even i as a seasoned veteran could not wrap my liver around this beast . avoid , boy ! avoid ... aaarrrggh .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	krusovice cerne is a very dark beer but with a fluid pour . the head is a thick caramel color and laces the glass beautifully . the smell of hops is pungeant , but the hoppy taste you would expect is not there . the flavor is that of coffee and caramel . you would think the beer would be a thick stout by the color , but it is actually a rather smooth beer to drink . the beer has the tendancy to coat your tongue which is less appealing , but the taste is similar to that of its smell .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70	750 split at tasting . a - orange , murky . s- smells like fish , wood , salt . funky as shit . t - citrus rind . wood . actually quite appealing . m - light body , good carbonation . o - not a bad beer . definitely unique and far from mass appeal , but i could have drank a 750 by myself .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90	poured my first bottle of this brew into a hobgoblin glass . deep , thick-looking honey coloured beer with a very fizzy head that would seem to imply heavy carbonation -- but it is n't ! i was almost turned off this beer by the smell -- somewhat unpleasant , and not what i had expected at all . i actually had an 'i hate clear bottles ' moment and thought it was skunked . taking a little more time , though , i did detect a strong , sweet malty note , with almost no bitterness , as well as some plums , honey , and overcooked vegetables ( this was not necessarily as unpleasant as it sounds ) . anyway , once i took a sip , i was pleasantly surprised . any skunk that i 'd detected earlier disappeared , and instead i was treated to very sweet malty flavours , almost cakey , with some sugarcane , roots , and other plants in there . a great , thick mouthfeel makes this beer very satisfying and drinkable . looking forward to the second bottle !

0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	a hazy amber/yellow orange concoction . the head is average . has a hazy thickness to the look . not bad . the aroma is out of this world . a very , very bready smell . heavy yeast and a cake-like aroma . a combination of pumpkin pie and -- perhaps more strongly -- carrot cake . like a liquified confection . immense . the taste is very strong carrot cake . pumpkin spice and brown sugar . very conspicuous alcohol burst . hits the back of the tongue with authority . rich and bready , like a sugary cake . feels thick and foamy . milky and chunky . chewy . it 's delicious and bursting with flavor , but also seriously heavy .

0.60 0.90 0.40 0.60 0.70	750ml synthetic-corked and caged bottle . it struggles to form a head as it pours a hazy brown . the head is white and sticks for a while before receding with some ok lacing . the smell is super fruity . there are lemons , citrus , grape , and oxidized apple . the taste is reminiscent of the flavor , though it has a kick of caramel sweetness that is almost too cloying . it is very sweet . the mouthfeel is a bit undercarbonated , especially for the style . it is a messy beer , but somewhat decent , the bottle was only 3.99 .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	beautiful dark mahogany with a thick , tan head . it 's smell is not terribly plesant : mostly skunk with raisins and jelly-bean sweetness . but to taste it is entirely different ! ! ! i was astounded by the massive taste of a very thick chocolate . i did not see that coming ! very thick and delicious ! what a lovely beer !

0.50 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	appearance : poured with a fizzy off white head that dissipated very quickly leaving no head . the beer is slightly hazy with a yellow golden color . smell : sweet fruit like berries , pear , and some citrus orange . strong spiciness not sure what kind of spices , maybe coriander . a bit musty , but in a good way , as it warms up it starts to smell like bread dough . taste : sweet white grapes , and apple . some citrus orange and spiciness similar to the smell with some cinnamon added . as it warms a strong floral honey flavor comes out . mouthfeel : medium body , a good amount of carbonation consisting of larger bubbles , pretty smooth , a little alcohol burn , and leaves mouth pretty clean . overall : pretty good drinkability , the appearance is really disappointing , but the ( more important ) smell and taste are great ! very nice sweet fruity character balanced with a beautiful spice .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	pours a dark brown , almost black color with burgundy edges at the base and a thick foamy beige head . roasted malty aroma with hazelnut , chocolate , caramel , toffee , syrup and alcohol notes . roasted chocolate malty flavor with hints of toffee , caramel , nut and oatmeal with a nice dry , bitter finish .

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	a - conservative head on a vigorous pour that quickly settled into a dusting of foam . ruby brown color . s - sweet malt , touch of cherry cordial . t - warming booze , malt , and some mulling spice , clove , star anise , cardamom . molasses . some dried plum in the finish . the flavors are great , but the balance is just a touch off . it 's tough to put my finger on it exactly . overall a surprisingly delicious beer though . m - well carbonated . sweet finish . medium body . d - very pleasant flavor profile and mouthfeel . touch of booze on the backend .

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80	harpoon ipa appears a medium gold color and is very transparent . it also has a big slightly off white head that has great retention . the smell it is not too strong but the exact herbal smell that you would expect from an ipa . its taste is the overwhelming hit of hops and bitterness that is expected from an american ipa . although , the aftertaste is quite unique with a malty smooth taste . the mouthfeel is surprisingly light , and the carbonation is fairly soft . harpoon ipa is fairly drinkable especially for its category . i would definitely suggest giving it a try .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.60	first off , this is a very good-looking beer . though there is no head , there is subtle lacing throughout the glass , and its color is a beautiful reddish amber . a bit of weak carbonation floats up from beginning to end , as well . the smell hits me right after it 's poured , hard to avoid . a strong resinous , almost marijuanaish aroma , which settles into a sweet red grapefruit smell after a few seconds . i love how the smell changes over time . taste is also of grapefruit , but more bitter than sweet . there 's a definite alcohol kick too , this one does not hide the abv well . i am not particularly fond of grapefruit , but i can at least respect that 3f hit the intended taste perfectly . this one takes a definite hit on mouthfeel , it 's a bit watered-down compared to other dipa 's . a bit more syrupy feel would match the taste . not much carbonation to speak of , either . another hit for drinkability . maybe it 's because i dislike grapefruit , but the combination of thinly masked abv and average mouthfeel make me not want to drink all that much of the dreadnaught . dogfish head 90-minute is much more drinkable and at least leaves me wanting another glass . got ta give 3f props for the phenomenal smell , tho .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.50	12 oz bottle poured into a pub glass . pours a crystal clear amber color with two fingers of off white head that has good retention ( about 4 minutes ) . light lacings . aroma is malty , with notes of caramel and grain , along with a light floral hop quality in the background . other notes include a touch of cinnamon , and a distant carmelized character as well . nicely balanced . taste is malty up front , with a mildly stale quality , along with a caramel finish of residual light hops . altogether not impressive , as the flavors seem to clash , failing to produce a single coherent brew . mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth and creamy texture . finishes semi-dry with residual mettalic hops . drinkability is not good . this brew falls short of a decent esb . the balance is off , and the flavors present produce a flabby mixture of disconnected flavors .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90	a : i would n't measure this head is fingers , i 'd do it in miles . poured 12 oz into a 22 oz hefe glass and could n't fit it all . the foam is white and creamy looking , beautiful . the beer itself though is a little too clear in some parts . instead of really dissipating through the beer , the yeast is hanging in arms and wisps . s : a very rich banana/clove mix , just about perfect . no hops , no nothing . not even that yeasty smell you get on some hefes . it 's a rich , creamy smell , if that makes sense , something i would expect from a banana milk shake or something . yum . t : less perfect . still a good banana/clove mix , but i get some off flavors as well , not many , but some . maybe something buttery ? still no hops , but no malt really either . not even a biscuity or wheaty one . this beer is really dominated by the yeast . m : on the thin side of creamy , but still feels smooth as if it was creamy , there is no crisp bite . i wish there was . seems to be almost a winter hefe ... d : great , for a hefe this is very light on carbonation , something that can easily turn me off for drinkability . a good flavor a good everything .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.50 0.50	black color to the brew with a nice brown head . decent lacing in the glass . faint smells of chocolate caramel malts , and coffee . a nice sweet taste from the caramel and chocolate . i ca n't taste any of the coffee i smelled and there is this odd twang at the end . almost like an ipa , definitely not my type of stout . decently creamy , light carbonation , and grapefruit finish . i would try it again , but definitely would n't buy it .

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.30 0.30	pours a flat looking dark but clear amber , with a thin crisp white head . moderate carbonation with a mild , bready smell . no bitterness to speak of , but a slight grassy hops smell comes through the malt . ugh . odd mix of rice fillers and an attempt at a heavier bodied macro . sharp almost medicinal hit on the back of the tongue , a bit band-aidish . not going to finish it .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	16.09.07 dark brown body with deep , bloody red rare highlights . catch the light the right way and the highlights glow radiantly . the surface has a brownish-yellow translucent layer as well , resting underneath a misty surface covered inadequately by cobwebby carbonation clusters . lacing dots the side of the glass gently and a ring stays around the edge . aroma vomits forth ripe , rich fruits . raisin paste and juicy plum notes jump out of the glass from a distance . brown sugar smack and a light maltiness carries with it the sweet odor of cherry syrup . the slightest hint of raw cocoa beans top off this exotic nasal medley . muddy and hot , slightly overcarbonated for the depth of flavor . nice caramel base although the alcohol abrasiveness and possible oxidation kills some of the subtler sweetnesses . warmth brings forth a kiss of fresh mowed grass and berry skins , saving the flavor from disappointing mediocrity . still , tastewise , there are better dubbels . it 's no 12 , but it 's a solid beer wrapped in an exquisite package . worth a try , glad i did .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60	1999 vintage pours a clear amber color with a decent sized tan head , head seems a bit creamy and fades at a decent rate , leaves a thin cap , no lacing . smell is predominately malty , bit of alcohol is present which is surprising considering this is a 10 year old vintage , lots of dark fruit and candied sugar . taste is very sweet , like lots and lots of sweetness , caramel comes through quite strongly along with dark fruit ( such as raisins ) , bit cloying from the sugary sweetness , the alcohol is n't as noticeable in the taste as it was in the aroma . i 'd be very interested in seeing how this develops by having a mini-vertical . i need to see if i can get a hold of some 1998 's still since i know i can get 99-03 no problem .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.40	pours a contrast filled deep amber with a foamy white head . smells of yeast and light hops . the taste is wayyy off for an american pale ale . it tastes strongly of yeast and has a rounded alcohol/bittersweet malt feel that usually comes with belgians . plus it is aggressively hopped with a very bitter , but not acidic hop . it 's too funky to be an apa and it 's too acridly sour to be a belgian . mixed together , it 's not very good at all . mouthfeel and drinkability are down there too . the smooth belgian feel to the beer just does n't feel right for the style . this combined with the overall taste makes it fairly undrinkable .

0.30 0.80 0.70 0.70 0.60	a : pours dark brown with purple hue , has a cloudy appearance ... similar to dark chocolate milk . no head retention . s : nose features rich roasted malta along with candied red grapes . a little bit of fig in there as well . t : taste starts out with milk chocolate followed by grapey sweetness , bitter roast towards the end with some heat to finish . interesting pairing of roasted flavors and belgian character mf : medium body , high carbonation o : flavors compete a little bit and the cloudy appearance is not very appetizing , definitely unique ... that does n't always translate to delicious though .

0.80 1.00 0.50 0.70 0.60	thanks to alexgrahamlv for sending me this a while back in a trade . he 's such a good trader that when i saw an iso he put up , i jumped on the chance to set up another trade with him . good stuff . review is from notes taken on 6/8/2010 and poured from the bottle to a snifter . appearance : pour is dark brown/near black ; starts with a near 1 finger tan head that fizzles out quickly like a cola ; leaves a faint skim in the middle of the surface ; body is entirely opaque and i can only see some faint hints of carbonation near the surface on the sides ; a few spots of tan lacing and a thin oily residue is left on the sides of the glass . smell : fantastic -- a nice burnt and robust roastiness from deep dark malts and what i can only guess is a longer boil ; a mild hint of a very dark and semi-sweet chocolate and a touch of a soda-like sweetness ; in all honesty , i 'm reminded of brownies that just came out of the oven and are just a little burnt around the edges . taste : the dark , burnt roastiness is the most prominent aspect ; the dark semi-sweet chocolate and a dark , earthy breadiness ; all of this may sound really good and it 's not bad , but the taste is a little thin and watery ; the flavors are n't nearly as robust as the smell would lead me to believe . mouthfeel : thin , a little watery , and even a little flat as the carbonation fizzles out quickly ; a moderate stickiness is left on the roof and the body actually feels a little slick . i remember this beer being better , but i likely had it fresher as this one sat around for a couple of months before i got around to drinking it . if i get another one , it will be drank immediately and if there is a marked difference , i 'll be editing this review accordingly . drinkability : not bad , but the flavors did n't come across like i wanted them to , and the body was pretty weak . i 'll gladly give another shot though .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	this brew poured a clear , dark red color . there was n't much of a head , but it did leave a nice little cap that was a light tan color and very creamy looking . not much lacing as the brew was drank , which is common with a brew that has such a high abv . the aroma on this brew begins with great biscuity malt , that nice a sweet , then moves on a bit of a grainy note . its followed by some great dark fruits , i can detect som raisins , maybe more . there is a bit of a caramel note as well , that feeds into the alcohol as the brew warms . the flavor on this brew is pretty good , but it is missing something . it starts out with the great malt flavors you smell in the front of teh brew , then it feeds into the biscuity/grainy malts and just a touch of dark fruits , which i really ca n't tell what they are . its kind of odd , the brew just gets heavy in alcohol and fades . it kinda loses its life . i was really enjoying , then nothing . the mouthful on this brew has a medium to heavy body , with not very much carbonation , which is pretty much expected with this style brew . there is a great alcohol punch as well . and a good finish as well , it just kind of loses its flavor in the warming . its there for the start , then fades to a straight alcohol burn . its still a decent brew , but not the best by any means when it comes to the style . its kind of lacking something . i feel it was missing more of the dark fruits you get in these brews . this brew has a decently high abv , so be ready for a big hit as you sip this brew .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90	this is one of the beers that got me interested in beer ... it was the nitro . i admit . the look is the most perfect , beautiful thing i have ever seen in the world of beer . the nitro just makes this beer cascade in a lava flow of gold-maize bubbles . the huge , chalk-white head is imposing , lasting , and the creamiest thing any beer could put into a glass . the scent is a malty mix of grains and corn . very wheaty smell with a very slight hint of hops . the hop flavor is immediately evident , but it fades quickly into a very sweet concoction of grains and butterscotch . the feel is airy but creamy . heavy and satisfying , but a little sticky . this is a fun beer that just looks great . i could drink an average tasting and smelling beer if it looked like this . good thing , tetley 's other qualities are n't that bad either .

1.00 0.60 0.60 0.90 0.80	poured exceptionally well , perfect head and great lacing . amber color with a slight cloudiness . smell was a little light but developed after taste was introduced . if agitated there is a burst of floral smell tasted good . a lot of barley . a very pleasant but subtle hop presence in the aftertaste . whenever this touched my mouth i got a sensation of flatness . this limited my enjoyment but it was actuallly well carbonated . a good beer , this was the first of 7 that my brother brought me from england and it was a great start !

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60	poured with a decent half-inch mocha head that quickly faded to lacing . would 've liked a little bit thicker head on this , but i 'll attribute it to the abv . a great dark red copper color . alcohol is definitely present in the smell , some caramel , some burnt grain , a little plum . the aroma on this beer is a little bit of a lot of different tones , with nothing over-powering , really nice . taste is decent . the high alcohol is clearly present and takes away from really picking up on the characteristics of the malt . can pick up on some burnt tones , some berry flavor , and a smooth bitterness . the carbonation is a little bit too much as well . not the best quad ever , but a pretty good representation . the alcohol is a little bit too prominent for my liking - even at 12 % . a little bit over-carbonated , which takes away from it a little bit .

0.60 0.20 0.40 0.30 0.20	you are not a beer drinker if you drink bud light . its success is due to marketing ; not fidelity to the craft/art of brewing excellent beer . it was made so that people can drink more -- not so that they can enjoy beer but so they can be drunk . beer is an experience . get over yourself , bud light !

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.40	a : pours a dark brick read color , almost brown . a two finger beige head forms with good retention . the foam gently recedes to leaves some patchy lace that crawls along the glass . s : bitter grapefruit , resiny pine , and mold wood . some booze . i ca n't really get anything else . t : follows the nose with tons of grapefruit and pine flavors . a very strong bitterness . a grainy , sugary sweetness tries to balance everything out in the middle , but to no avail . another shot of lingering bitterness finishes everything out . plenty of alcohol as well . m/d : a full body that is resiny , sticky , and syrupy . hard to drink because of the strong bitterness and hot alcohol . i thought i would give this a try . so many people rave about all of stones bastard beers , and i just do n't get it . this might be the best of the bunch , but that is not saying much for me . this does not have the degree of harshness and burning as some of the others , but still up there in that regard . not something i would recommend .

0.70 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70	i always look forward to the alley kat seasonals , they 've been improving considerably over the years . the sight of their recent coffee porter was a curious surprise , but i 've snatched up a few 6 's of these since . honestly , i have to confess that i am not a coffee drinker , nor do i enjoy coffee much at all . but this stuff is the cat 's ass ! pours out a deep opaque black , yet gives up garnet/cola highlights when held up to direct light . tan head lasts a minute but not much longer , and recedes to a thin ring . the smell is amazing . like i stated above , i 'm not big into coffee , but even this is appealing , and impressive to pull off . this porter does nothing but give off an intense and clean cafe au lait aroma , straight to the point . roasted malt and equally roasted coffee grounds in the flavour . fairly one-dimensional , but they do a good job with that singular flavour profile . the coffee is certainly present , but not too overbearing over the malt . the mouthfeel is medium-bodied and somewhat gritty , but carries the flavour fairly well . in the end this is an enjoyable coffee porter , and one brewed well enough that i can easily shake off my personal bias for coffee and enjoy it for what it is , as the coffee grounds do nothing but compliment the roasted malts of this style . it 's greatest attribute is the aroma however , that is really phenomenal .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90	found this brew ( ca n't believe i 've never even tried this , let alone reviewed ) at the new downtown portland ( i.e . pearl ) whole foods coffee bar , 'the mezz ' . a bargain/special price of $ 2/pint makes it irresistable . a : glass arrived a bit overly-frosty , hence a bland haziness amidst an amber pour . plenty of rapid carbonation rising to a 1-finger ivory cream , quite dense . excellent lace : soapsuds in speckled rings . s : ho-hum aroma , even as it nears room temperature . greeted with a bready/light toast sweetness - a grain-forward ipa . ends flowery and just a little soapy . t : fine , yet nothing really overly remarkable . a loaded biscuit-y pale malt , with good caramel ( pralines , maybe ? ) and a juicy orange/citrus backing , a brekfast scone or dessert pastry . lacks something from the typically hop-centric nw ipa , but i 'm perfectly ok with that ; the balance better matches my palate . m : little thin , a cool/mild feel . i suppose that equals 'creamy ' for me , but others might deem it 'weak ' , even 'boring ' . whatever , i 'm satisfied ... d : for all its qualities that scrape past 'average ' , i liked this brew . alot : extremely easy to drink , neither cloying or sticky , good balance . honestly seems closer to an apa ( maybe english ipa ? ) compared to the bracingly hoppy ipas 'round these parts , but i do n't mind . certainly worth a try or worth having again ( depending on your own preferences ) .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	the best thing about this ale is its looks , a clean and radiant orange copper . only minimal lacing though . nose is hoppy with some caramel and fig . taste is hoppy with muted maltiness . dry and semi-sweet . decent but not overwhelming mouthfeel and good drinkability . pretty good overall but not a go-getter .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	nitro-bottle into a pint glass . reads on the bottle , `` pure luxury '' . `` ale with natural chocolate flavor added '' . as a chocolate and beer lover , i 'm expecting something of god . a : pours like chocolate milk , gulping , a very dark brown . a perfect frothy tan head appears , about a finger high . this is the beauty of the nitro-bottle . absolutely fantastic . s : very feint smell , chocolate note , but a bit of roasty malt as well . t : surprisingly roasty . chocolate is present , but not overpowering , and largely on the finish . m : creamy and smooth . quite nice . lighter body than one would expect , somewhere in-between a medium and a thick d : a fantastic dessert beer , like a good glass of chocolate milk but not as sweet . imagine guinness , with chocolate added , and it 's about right .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70	maybe i 'm crazy , but scotch pine and cocoa powder do n't really mix well to me . chocolate covered grapefruit for breakfast ? nah . christmas trees in my roasty-toasty brews ? nah . bitter-smelling citrus and hershey 's ? nah . the aroma just does n't work for me here . it 's strong , unique , unexpected , powerful , crisp , and original . but so what ? chocolate and pine needles do n't mix in my mind , and they certainly did n't mix well in my nose . i can give it points for those other attributes -- predominantly originality -- but not every combination works well . the dominant force is a heavily sappy pine aroma that fades to more of a citric nose as the beer warms further . a pure chocolate aroma develops along the same timeline . after smelling it , the real surprise was that it managed to have a real solid , balanced flavor . the hops are nearly 100 % aromatic . slick hot fudge flavors dominate and find themselves laying in the toaster oven blackening to a nice roasted flavor . a little thin but not really to any sort of detriment -- and exceptionally drinkable . hops show up as the roasted cocoa fades and dominate the aftertaste . just really kind of an odd mix in the nose ... but intriguing ! thnx to tim for the sample !

0.40 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	sweet marzipan-like smell reminds me of candied cake bread . no head at all atob the dark amber body . no lacing either . sweet , malty , nutty taste in the fore . strangely there is more alcohol in the tatse than i would have anticipated , but it doesnt detract from the flavor ( which is good because it is n't that flavorful ) because sweet malts seem to handle that just fine i just did n't expect to taste much alcohol fromt his style .

0.90 1.00 0.50 0.60 0.70	appearance : dark chocolate color with a a thick light cappuccino color at poor - settles down in a minute or so time smell : sweet milk chocolte smell . some fruit in the background possibly some raisin taste : sweet with a deep malt flavor in the back . slight malt aftertaste may be overwhelming . mouthfeel : relatively thin when compared to some other stouts , but refreshing drinkability : slow to warm up to , but like most dark stouts , once you settle in , they become more delicious by the sip overall , impressed , but dry malt aftertaste could be refined slightly

0.40 0.80 0.30 0.60 0.30	after all the critiscism about canadian beers in general lately , i decided to review this one . picked up a single for the sale price of 25cents . the lady said something about them not getting distributed here anymore . anyways , onto the review . pours a fizzy yellow , with a small white head . smell is actually quite strong , a blast of medicinal malts , along with hops . grapes as well . taste is strong of malts , along with grapes , and slight hoppiness . semi-bitter , semi-clean , semi-astringent . overall the things that are kind of odd in this beer is the grapes , where the hell did those come from ? as well as the medicinal astringencys , they are not bad , but definitely there . this beer is not offensive , but leaves me wanting more . a lot more . a decent light lager . there are lots of worse light beers , and lagers out there . this one is just alright .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	the beginning of english beer night and a ruddles bitter packaged in a pretty clear bottle that i purchased with some trepidation , knowing that such a well-hopped brew could be skunked . i crack open the bottle and get a whiff of skunk that dissipates as the pint is left to sit on the counter and warm up a bit ; not too disappointing . the first sip is quite smooth with a some tasty caramel malt flavors paving the way for spicy hops , followed by more ( bitter ) hops and a long bitter finish -- quite bitter , actually . the bottle says this ale is brewed with `` mineral water '' and this becomes rather obvious as the beer warms up . the minerals seem to add almost salty , slate-like flavor that seems to play nicely with the hops , adding complexity to this brew . this remarkably clear ale looks good , too , with an off-white head that leaves some lacework . overall , ruddles is good bitter stuff .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60	this brew pours with a slightly cloudy , deep amber body topped by a medium thick off white head with a good amount of lacing . the aroma is rather weak . it 's slightly sweet , malty and fruity with a slight caramel note . the flavor is similar but more pronounced . it 's light to medium bodied and smooth .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	poured from a bottle into imp pint glass with drink by date of march 2009. pours a clear light copper with a little head , very light retention . smell was lacking with barely any hop scent coming from the pour . i think i smelled more malts than hops . taste was slightly bitter but rather washed out . it was very bitter but heavy malt presence . the best part was the finish . carbonation was strong , a smidge too strong for me overall , i am not too impressed . the brooklyn lager is far more hopped than this offering . not sure how old this bottle is but it lacks hops . brooklyn brewery is a solid brewery so i wo n't hold this against them .

0.50 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.40	lightly chilled bottle into a glass . a generous extra from beerwolf77 . thanks todd ! a : pours a very dark brown . ruby translucence at the edges . the head is a half finger of light tan head that retains pretty well , fading into a moderate collar with some sticky lacing down the glass . s : coffee -- kind of a roasted , nearly burnt , aroma . a dark fig aroma , brown sugar , and some dark chocolate . t : again , strongly coffee-driven . it 's surprisingly bitter , unlike founders breakfast stout , which does a great job of integrating coffee and chocolate flavors . this is much rougher , bringing in the coffee first and gradually progressing into chocolate , dark fruit , and some brown sugar . the coffee pulls into the aftertaste for a very bitter close . m : thin-bodied , and watery in flavor . i 'm not a fan . d : definitely a weak point in the central waters lineup . i much prefer their coffee stout or founders breakfast stout ( a more accurate comparison ) to this one . not a strong showing .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.60	i got a half a finger head out of the pour that seemed more carbonated than i would 've expected . the head recedes quickly into a thin lace . it 's a full , deep mahogany brown , almost opaque but light is getting through at the top and bottom edges . it smells of mocha and cinnamon , an overall roasted aroma , but not overly so . muddled but emphatic and tastes much like it smells . i 'm not getting a lot of chocolate ; potent mocha and coffee starts to stand out . staining with it 's sharper ends , but not off-putting . the finish is surprisingly clean . there 's a reason it 's a porter and not a stout and the carbonation has much to do with that . a tough but rewarding dessert beer .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	12 oz . bottle served in pint glass this one pours like iced tea . the off-white head is modest in size , but fades to a slick . there is great lacing and tons of carbonation . the aromas are hard to find , but hint at biscuits . the mouthfeel is creamy . the taste is very balanced -- english pale ale . the taste is butterscotch with some citrus peaking through . the overall taste is soapy , but then again i think all english pales taste like this , so i guess it is correct for the style . the hops are here strictly for balance , having no real profile to mention . the finish is medium in length . again , not my favorite style , but i guess an okay beer .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.40	pours a hazed rust hued body , topped by a small , offwhite head that quickly falls away . aroma is pungent with herbs , mostly sassafras . i really enjoy the aroma of this . quite fragrant ! anise , clove , and wintergreen compliment the sassafras . mouthfeel is ight bodied , with medium carbonation . taste echoes the nose , with sassafras , wintergreen , and clove , joined by a honey and molasses sweetness that quickly grows cloying . a very interesting brew , but not one i can handle . simply too sweet , and the herbal essence is too overbearing .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	a- pours dark brown , almost black with a thin mocha head that settles rather quickly to leave minimal lacing s- alot of roasty malts . mainly coffee and bittersweet cocoa come through on the nose . minimal hop characteristic if any at all . some caramel/tofee sweetness . t- similar to the nose . roasty malts . alot of black coffee flavor mainly . some bittersweet cocoa . not much of the caramel toffee flavor . a little underwhelming and slightly bitter . m/d- mouthfeel is on the thin side for a porter . not what i was looking for . the drinkability is good . i could polish off a couple of these in a sitting and still be good for some bigger beers . a good choice for a session porter

0.70 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.60	a- i see some bits of hop floating about . i like it - i 've only seen this in my homebrew . the bits off hops want to fall but are sometimes pushed back up by the few bubbles rising in the burnt umber liquid - very cool . head is okay but melts away quickly . i was expecting lots of it so i 'm kind of bummed out . lacing is less than ok. another bummer . s-sniff of the opened bottle smells like a great fruit salad and strawberry jam . in glass , strawberry jam . sweet hops . caramel . smells good but a lot less powerful than i thought . t- ca n't wait to taste this ... disappointing . i do n't know about their cold hopping ... the hop flavour is one of the dullest ones i 've tasted in a double ipa and they do n't taste particularly fresh . candied onion ( i swear that 's what i taste ) . wooden popsickle stick . i then let it warm up to see if i get anything different , and nothing more . only malt/caramel flavour got a little stronger . alcohol is present but melds very nicely with the rest making it pretty sneaky . m- full bodied . low carbonation . d- i guess it drinks well but i think i 'm just thirsty . with the odd tastes and lack of freshness i 'm pretty sure i 'd switch beers right away . very disappointed . such a nice-looking bottle and i had a hop craving . only reason i 'd try this again is if someone assured me this was great and i probably had a bad bottle . but ... love the fragments of hop leaves in the brew . really cool .

0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40 0.40	exactly what part of the population likes to drink this beer ? it tastes like sink run-off . it 's harsh with a bad aftertaste . and it has no odor .

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.40	and i thought it was relatively difficult to screw up a generic pale ale . how wrong was i . golden copper with an attractive lace . as with the other samples i tried , no real discernable nose to speak of . plastic malt taste all over the board with biting cascades in the forefront . no late-boil fruitiness . again with the `` hop tincture '' taste . the rubberiness of this beer makes me envision poorly stored hops in a big ol ' ziplock bag . this beer is about on par with licking the wort out of that bag . completely bitter with no semblance of malt viscocity . not entirely undrinkable , but close .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.70	12oz . bottle poured into as snifter . 2011 vintage . huge thanks to hopsbreath for sending this my way ! ( a ) - pours a fairly thick , almost plum colored cabernet wine-like inky color . not much foam to speak of , but some transparent bubbles came up . ( s ) - a ridiculously rich aroma . awesome whiffs of oaky bourbon with sweet toffee and caramel with an even more glorious smell of cocoa covered dark cherries behind it . its strong , but smells really stinking good . ( t ) - very similar to the smell . a rich and sweet profile with decadent cocoa covered dark cherries with a smooth caramel and oaky bourbon notes . ( m ) - flat as a pancake , however for the style , it isnt quite as bothersome as i was expecting it to be . if it had a bit of carbonation , this would be world class . rich and sweet with those black cherries really providing nice flavors and texture . ( d ) - a sipper for sure . yes it would help this immensely if this was carbed better , but nonetheless , the smell and flavor of this is really quite unique and spot on for a fantastic old ale . i can see this being a great substitution for a ruby port .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.30	poured into a pint glass . 3.5 a : i 'd like to start out by saying that i had to pour like a crazed lunatic to get my 2 fingers of head . cloudy medium orange color . head surprisingly has average retention and a good amount of lacing . 3.5 s : orange peel . orange zest . lots of orange going on . a bit lemony as well and a touch of grassy hops . 3.0 t : the first sip almost knocked me on my ass from the huge alcohol punch . caramel sticks out like a sore thumb . did n't expect this from a wit . banana and orange blend together to form a very tasty fruitiness . still alcohol runs rampant . tastes kinda like a homebrew gone unchecked . 3.0 m : medium body . good carbonation , but once again the alcohol comes in to crash the party , preventing a smooth finish . 2.0 d : this gives a good argument for why witbiers should not be imperialized . there is n't enough going on to neutralize the alcohol . simple as that . this is my second sa imperial series . the stout had the same ultra alcohol burst problem too . one more to go it appears .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	aquired from dgb3 . curtsy of review this bif . major thank you to dgb3 ... totally the major shit on a hook up . a : the lacing is outstanding . dgb3 hooked me up w/a great pint glass from `` nectar ales '' and the color is just pure amber color . the head was great . s : citrus orangy smell and pine . t : floral taste w/a pine . m : medium body . med carb . creamy and hoppy after taste . d : i really liked this beer . i could totally sit around and have this all night . super light and comfortable .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip . a - color is a deep apricot that 's slightly hazy . i get roughly a finger of head that leaves a film sitting on the beer and just a touch of lacing . s - in line with the style . i get a nice dose of floral and citrus hops . t - umm ... this is an ipa ? there 's a bit of hops up front , but they quickly go away . malts take over with a bit of a metallic edge towards the end of each sip . the finish is rather dry and bitterness is ok , but the flavor is nothing close to what i was expecting out of this beer . m - the mouthfeel is way too light and close to watery . o - until i actually started drinking this beer it seemed awesome ... not so much . this is the first time that i 've picked up a 6 pack of this beer and i certainly wo n't be buying again .

0.30 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.80	easily the best adjunct lager i 've ever had . thats right folks , this beer has a flavor ! sure , its not much of a flavor . but its certainly a flavor . yeah , its your typical macro taste with a little something extra . the guys over at miller must have splurged on the rice when formulating this recipe . a welcome suprise for sure . when the can hit my lips i was expecting another tasteless beer , but i got flavor . not much , but more than normal .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	on tap at rustico in alexandria , va . served in a tall , flute-like glass . appearance : pale straw gold , with a solid , very fine-bubbled head , sheet like atop the body . loads of active , bubbly effervescence . a fine looking brew . aroma : mild , with some belgian spices and a few funky yeast notes . nothing outstanding . taste : very , very tart and dry , lemon and other fruity esters , light orange zest , and a few spices - cloves , white pepper . a little too tart for me , but i wo n't knock it for that . mouthfeel : light bodied , with medium bubble size and a very even-feeling body . pleasant . drinkability : very easy-going and light , even for a `` double wit '' - what is that anyway ? good if you like tart beers . it 's not puckering , just very dry .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	had this on-tap at hooter 's of marietta , ga in a `` big boy '' stein . they always serve the beer far too cold which results in no aroma whatsoever . appearance : was a dark copper to crimson color with a creamy 1/2 '' head . the head fell down to a thin white foam on the top of the beer . it started to lace the glass after the mug warmed up . smell : see notes above . taste : tasted of christmas spices ( cinnamon , ginger , clove , and allspice ) . reminds me a lot of ginger snaps . the on-tap seemed to have a little more bitterness on the back end than the bottled . mouthfeel : biggest difference between the bottle and the tapped is the mouthfeel . the bottle is more like a typical ale in the mouthfeel while this seemed to be nearly as creamy as a stout until the head fell . it still seemed to have more body than normal . excellent . drinkability : always good . you might not want to knock back 2 or 3 while on your lunch break but very smooth and easy to put back .

0.60 0.60 0.90 1.00 0.90	on-tap at the porter in the atl . this beer arrives with a tumescent bloom of head that immediately fizzles into oblivion leaving meager lacing atop a strikingly garnet and opaque body . very simply , appearance-wise , this beer is not markedly impressive - with its stillness and particular redness it could easily be mistaken for a glass of pinot or cabernet . accordingly , the nose ( what little manages to announce itself ) is wholly dominated by obvious wine-like grape notes and supple/elegant tannins ; there might be a spicy undertone ( nutmeg ? cinnamon ? oak ? ) but i 'd be hard pressed to effectively parse it and it might just be a cerebral concoction . however , once we have moved beyond these categories , this beer is radiant . the upfront taste is , primarily , a subtle grape sweetness that works cooperatively with a rather pleasant alcohol burn which is , in turn , ideally ballasted by a dense malt profile and an arresting clove note . the finish is faintly sour and wine-like with some hop bitterness , more pungent clove and a dream moment of graham cracker presence - of course , all of this is beautifully balanced . the feel is gently carbonated , extremely dense and somewhat ideal . ultimately , this beer is a stunner , a lovely quad possessive of a masterfully executed tangle of flavors , a rich , sweet and perilously complex beer that should n't be ignored .

0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.90	of course , as with most of us , this is one of those beers , like newcastle and guinness , that bridges us from macros to micros , so its about time i give it a review a - pours a dark reddish brown with a thin lacy tan head s - has a musty , hoppy aroma that i have come to love over the years , also a slight citrus/tea twang t - has a sweetness to it at first , like a vanilla flavor that abruptly shifts to a bitter hoppy finish , these flavors are balance very well m - a medium bodied well balanced ale , very smooth and bitter all at once , a great and classic beer d - high , i love thses , very easy to pound , even my girlfriend like bass which says alot for its drinkability

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.30 0.40	got these ones at de bierkoning in amsterdam . from a bottle into a snifter . note : part of the yin-yang pair , which are meant to be mixed . decided to drink a bit of each separately first . appearance : pours a 1+ finger , medium looking , off-white head with very good retention . head slowly fades to a good wisp and clings to the sides of the glass . hazy burnt orange in color with medium carbonation evident . a nice wisp remains until the end and leaves some great lacing down the glass . good looking . smell : good nose as well . pale malts , caramel malts , pineapple and lemon notes . some grapefruit for sure and touches of orange peel . very citrus and fruity . nice stuff . taste : nasty . some pale malts up front and notes of sweet caramel , then a harsh boozy middle and finish . lots of alcohol , some pine , as well as an off-putting burst of cough syrup . pretty rough . bold and unappealing aftertaste of alcohol , bitter hops and cough syrup . perhaps some fain fruity melon and pineapple , but hard to detect with all the booze and cough syrup . palate : medium body and medium carbonation . a little rough on the palate , goes down alright but finishes quite harsh and hot . slightly dry on the palate . this is pretty boozy and tough to get through . overall : this is like my favorite football team ; a solid first half , then they fall apart in the second half . i had some high hopes for this one , but in really did suck . lots of booze and cough syrup , and a harsh , hot feel to boot . hopefully itll do better mixed with yin . edit : mixed was actually pretty good . the hoppy nose from the dipa still came through , which was probably the best part of the experience , and the cough syrup flavors were much more restrained . if i had to drink yin and yang again , i 'd definitely mix them .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.80	a : pours a clear , bright orange color with a small bone white head on top that has decent staying power . s : faint smells of oranges and honey and quite a bit of booze . smell reminds me a bit of apple cider vinegar and copper . not a real great combo . t : tastes are of orange peel , honey , and a fair amount of booze . also some caramel and vanilla as the beer warms . m : mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy for a pilsner , but then again this is n't your average pilsner either . quite warming , which is not a surprise at the 11 % abv . d : i 'm not a huge pilsner fan , so i do n't think i 'd want to drink this all this time , but it goes down smooth and easy for such a strong beer . on a side note i really enjoy the label art of the jacked and tan honey bee .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	appearance . hazy , light amber-gold . just a little white , sticky head that leaves some spotty lacing . smell . big piney , citrusy hops , sweet caramel and some toasted light grains . smells great . taste . floral , citrus hops , pretty stong toasted light grains , a little honey and booze . lasting toasty bitterness . mouthfeel . medium-full body with smooth medium-low carbonation . just a little warm alcohol . overall . a decent iipa . flavours seem a little harsh and it 's a little boozy , but not too shabby .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	so i had this on tap before and now i found it at a local store . decided to try the bottle . it had a smoother taste which could be due to the freshness or quality of the keg i was drinking out of . this was bottled on 11/28/11 . red/amber color . clear . bubbley head . very bitter citrus smell . sweet to the taste . immediately you get a nice hoppy bite , not too strong , slighty citrus malt taste . smooth dry finish . the bite on the hops did n't seem as prominant , its smoothed out by the sweet malt flavor . still a bit of a bitter hop after tast but i really enjoy this beer .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.40	poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter . a : beautiful red color with one inch white foam that disapates quickly upon drinking although decent lacing on glass throughout . s : very fruity , slightly sweet . quite inviting actually . t : fruity . tart , but not the way any other lambic i 've ever tasted . disappointing really . m : light-medium . tart , and not overly carbonated . d : very seasonal but there are much better coices out there . does not taste like a lambic but more like a sour fruit ale . would not drink another .

0.50 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.70	i 'm not a big fan of lobster ... lets see how this one plays out . ( holy crap , 9.5 % abv ) pours a clear golden color with white head that quickly dissipates . smells vaguely of hops . very faint odor . doesn ; t taste bad at all . you can definately taste the alcohol , the hops hit first followed by the sweet balance of malt which in turn converts to the burn of alcohol . i keep tasting butter but i think that 's becaue it keeps making me think of lobster . very smooth on the palate , a nice balanced carbonation level and no unpleasant after taste . it 's drinkable . i ca n't imagine pounding something with an abv this high over and over again , but it 's certainly not a beer i 'd be opposed to drinking again ... though probably not very often .

0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40 0.40	poured into a clear acrylic tumbler ... no glassware to be found , but i do n't think that will matter . darker than i expected . head almost absent , left a thin ring at the top of the brew that dropped with the level . no lacing whatsoever . aroma is there ... just not good . taste is the same . close to corona , not a lot of flavor . mouthfeel : high carbonation , thin . overall , not a good beer for my tastes ; almost a drain pour . maybe a bad batch ? wo n't buy again .

0.80 0.20 0.50 0.30 0.20	i recently bought a case of harbour gold , and was quite impressed with that beer , so i figured i would give this one a shot . i have n't had any other beer from this brewer 650 ml bottle purchased from the lcbo the beer to me tasted sour . i think something went wrong with this bottle somewhere along the line . i tried to taste past the sourness and get to the underlying character of the beer , but ultimately after a few sips it was a drain pour . i think that there was potential in there somewhere . hopefully they can get this cleared up . i would like to see some smaller canadian brewers doing well .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.90 1.00	poured from the bottle into a half-pint glass . color is a beautiful deep copper , almost red . lacey nice head : enough for taste , but not too much . a light mouth , followed by a rich , wide bitter taste , that lingers on the tongue . ( citrus notes , with mild spiciness on the sides of the tongue . ) this makes it easy to quaff , yet still satisfying to linger over . paired exceptionally well with cold sesame noodles . the beer cleansed the palette , without overwhelming the subtleness of the food . my wife , not a beer drinker , was intrigued by the color and when given a taste , she greatly enjoyed it .

0.60 1.00 0.60 0.50 0.80	bought this in july in burlington , vt . appearance : indeed ruby colored , with weak little head . smell : wow ... i was n't expecting this at all . incredibly hoppy , honey , almost strawberry jam sticky hop smell . taste : i found it a little too watery at first , which was a dissapointment . i could barely taste any malt at all . the hop character that started off slow as well built up some momentum after a few sips and saved the day . another intriguing brew with an awful label from ray mcneil .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured a orange-golden color that looked flat at first . after pouring a little more aggressively , i got a nice inch and a half head in my hennepin tulip that left good lacing . the smell was pretty vague for me ... can pick up on some floral and citrus hops and sweet caramel malts . the taste was more than i expected ... roasted nuts , some hoppy bitterness , dill , and some chocolaty malt flavors . depending on how you let it leave your tongue , you can get some sweet or slightly tart aftertones . the mouthfeel is light and refreshing . exactly what i was looking for with a little more on the flavor side to boot . the local store just got this in . if they 'll keep it in stock , i 'll be frequently purchasing it throughout the summer .

0.80 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.40	`` after trying 3 other horrible macro adjunct lagers , you can say im less than thrilled to try another . '' - fellow ba mob210sa '' oh ! the places you 'll go ! you 'll be on your way up ! you 'll be seeing great sights ! you 'll join the high fliers who soar to high heights . you wo n't lag behind , because you 'll have the speed . you 'll pass the whole gang and you 'll soon take the lead . wherever you fly , you 'll be best of the best . wherever you go , you will top all the rest . except when you do n't . because , sometimes , you wo n't . i 'm sorry to say so but , sadly , it 's true that bang-ups and hang-ups can happen to you . you can get all hung up in a prickle-ly perch . and your gang will fly on . you 'll be left in a lurch . you 'll come down from the lurch with an unpleasant bump . and the chances are , then , that you 'll be in a slump . and when you 're in a slump , you 're not in for much fun . un-slumping yourself is not easily done . '' - dr. seuss when i embarked on the canquest , i had no idea just how much macroswill existed in cans , although i know now . seeing `` light lager '' or `` american adjunct lager '' in the style column only reminds me of the slump part of all of the places that the canquest has taken me . and on that note ... my pour resulted in two fingers ' worth of foamy , bone-white head exploding with co2 bubbles that fell like a souffle when the door is banged closed . it did leave some nice lacing as a parting gift , though . color was a golden-yellow with ne-plus clarity ( it gave me x-ray vision , allowing me to see through walls ) . nose was an unholy combo of metallic , cereal , and a light lager-ish sweetness as a reminder of what could have been . mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a bland , watery taste in the mouth . `` full flavor '' read the can and yet i found myself wondering , `` full of what ? '' finish was equally bland and boring . it is not that this tasted bad or foul , it just did not taste at all . oof .

0.80 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.00	pours a rich copper color with a very tight off-white head about two fingers thick which recedes to a halo of foam that lasts to the bottom of the glass . smell is a little flat ... some burnt caramel and a little bit of orange citrus . taste is off the rocker , though ... this is basically dogfish head 90 minute without the bitterness . lots and lots and lots of strong orange citrus flavor backed by a nice sweet caramel balance with a mildly bitter finish . mouthfeel is nice and creamy . drinkability is off the charts . all of that flavor without a palate destroying bitterness , and an abv that hovers just over the session beer range ? i 'll take another six pack or two , please ! found this at sunflower market ... first time i 've ever seen it ... for $ 6.99 a pack on sale . a real deal , great beer , i 'll get another pack if it 's still there next time .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	a : light brown / golden color - almost honey-like in appearance . translucent with no sediment or haze . poured with very little head . s : bananas , nuts , hints of clove ( reminded me a tad bit of some hefeweizen yeasts ) . but honestly , the more i smelled it , it truly just smelled like banana bread . t : flavor is definitely muted compared to the scent . similar elements , though . bready malts and yeast , banana , and some hop bitterness as well . m : relatively light body and carbonation . approximately similar to an esb style texture . o : not bad overall , but definitely is a novelty beer . smells fantastic and tastes ok . i ca n't imagine buying it again .

0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	on-tap at rfd an orange-copper color with minimal off-white colored head that dissipates quickly leaving behind some nice lacing . aromas of hops and oranges seem to dominate . not much else is detectable . the taste is quite different than other apas with a sweeter profile that blends very well with the hop flavor . seems more like an ipa or even a mild double ipa in terms of the hop presence and aftertaste . a bit more sour in the back of my throat over time than i would like , hence the lower score . lower abv and the taste make this a beer that can be had over and over . overall , this is an enjoyable beer with some interesting characteristics and worth a try .

1.00 0.70 0.90 0.90 0.90	oak aged batch 308 picked up at liqour world in fayetteville , ar pours an effervescent straw with 2 fingers of eggshell colored head . murks a bit a the bottom as you 'd expect from a bottle conditioned beer s : horse blanket & lemons , fades over time t : lemons , sourness , grassyness & funky acidity up front . green apple peels , dirt & sourness dominates as this warms along with dryness , along with a touch of lemons & grapefruits & more tartness & acidity . finishes with much citrus & acidity , grainyness , was close to a 5.0 mf : pretty smooth , but the acidity does detract a bit up front . medium bodied with hints of stickyness as this warmed , but the vigirous carbonation balanced this out drinks very easy for the abv & sourness & everything else going on . probably the best jp bier i 've had , by far ! easily on of the best american sours i 've had ...

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	i 've been meaning to try this beer for a while , and after a brutal day at work , i just want something simple . appearance : hey , this ai n't too bad at all . crystal clear lager gold that boasts good carbonation . a generous pour produced a finger of head that surprisingly laces and retains somewhat . more then i would ever expect from an adjunct lager . smell : a slight tinge of skunk permeates the brew with notes of corn with a touch of tropical fruit scent . it does carry itself decently , even with some warming . not exactly that great , but you could do worse . taste : sweet malt with a hint of corn and what i think might be pineapple of all things ( odd i know ) . it then turns to more grain and fruity taste that turns to a light dusting of grassy , fruity and citric hops . simple , but not too simple , especially for the style . mouthfeel : a slight acidic aftertaste ends the experience but it quickly gives way to a more grassy fruit aftertaste . mouth is neither too dry or moist and the carbonation does a good job of accenting the beer , just well enough . drinkability : very refreshing , and yet somehow manages to not come off as watered down . very light bodied so drinking it all night is n't an issue and decently smooth going down . that being said , the acidic touch stops it from being a guzzler and it does leave me belching a bit . still , i could drink it all night though . final thoughts : after having banks , i was hoping that red stripe would not follow the same tread as that god awful caribbean beer . however this beer surprised me , and apart from the smell , is a good beer , especially for an adjunct . really , the only thing else that needs to be said is , hooray beer !

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.40	pours with copious amounts of creamy , tan head . brilliant copper body that almost glows . a very appetizing appearance . fresh , sweet and spicy on the nose . immediately noticeable alcohol . light scotch whisky presense . fused with coriander , caramelized sugars , pine aromas and a sweet malt presence . very powerful . a rush of malty flavors quickly subdued by a charcoal / woody presence . spicy and tangy suggesting coriander and curry . big peat , smoke and black licorice flavors in the finish dominated by a massive , almost overbearing barley flavor . notes of sweet toffee and caramel round out the finish . unforunately , there is a very long and pungent aftertaste that is loaded with a burned barley flavor and tons of smoke . faint hop presence as it warms . mouthfeel is a little heavy and not quite as creamy as i would expect from more of a scottish ale than a scotch ale . drinkability is so-so . it was a unique example of the style but a little difficult to consume . i left disappointed since i am a big fan of this style . it is doubtful that i would purchase another .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90	a- bottle poured into a pint , fluffy two finger head that lasted a long time , copper brown coloring , nice long lasting lacing , good looking beer . s- i got alot of metallic on the nose ( kinda offputting ) , with a good bit of floral hops , nice malt backbone . t- glad that i did n't get any metallic notes in taste , really nice balance of malt and hops , nice smack of hops on the finish , tasty . m- nice medium bodied , goes down very easy . d- super drinkable , i 'm such a sucker for apas , very tasty , i 'll definately buy this again , another great offering from sam adams , ca n't say i 've ever had a bad beer from mister koch .

0.70 0.20 0.60 0.30 0.20	visiting toronto , pulled this of the local liquor control shelf as a local . i 've traveled all over , and this is about the worst beer i 've had since brewii in baltimore in 1979 . that says alot . love thetaps logo , that was the only good feature of this beer . big daddy

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80	brownish/red in color , similar to yuengling lager . not to an overpowering hop smell , but a good bite on the taste , hoppyness similar to a lighter ipa . `` thin '' mouthfeel , not as much body as i would expect from and amber ale but would probably make it easy to drink several of these or enjoy it on a hot day . very enjoyable brew , would purchase again !

0.50 0.30 0.60 0.60 0.70	appearance : amber colored , crystal clear . no head . smell : little hop aroma . needs much more . very not to style taste : nice hop crispness . malt is not complex . good balance . no hop harshness . lacks overall complexity . mouthfeel : like it should be . nothing really stands out . drinkability : a nice introduction to ipa to the bmc folks , but there are much better examples of the style out there .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	nice to have this brewer readily available in alberta ... dark cloudy brown with a nice tan head that receeds slowly into a tan cap . nice rye & crystal malts with a very fragrant peppercorn aroma . never have i experieince such a beer aroma . peppercorn flavour is quite a shocker @ first . luckily smooth rye malts help wash that away . finish is slick and peppery . nice medium body . carbonation is lower which helps with the pepper heat . interesting take on a beer . i like peppercorn sauces so i found this to be quite an enjoyable experienc , but i can see others being turned off .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	22oz bottle . pours a translucent dark ruby color with over an inch of frothy head . tons of lacing . aroma is piney and citrusy hops . some sweet caramel malts as well.. taste is piney , bitter hops up front with some caramel malts . floral and piney at the end . slightly oily and resinous . nice blend of malt and hops , but i was hoping for a bit more hops on this one . overall , im digging it and would have it again .

0.50 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	we 've all drank it , and i 'm sure , had mixed feelings . in my opinion its not as bad as everyone says . for a macro lager made for mass consumption it has more flavor than one should expect . typical appearance for a lager and a distinct pretzel flavor . the mouth-feel is crisp and refreshing which is it 's best quality . i 'm not arguing that its a great beer , just good for what it is .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40	for a wheat ale , i did n't really like this beer . i was expecting a typcial wheat beer with a hint of banana like it mentions . i guess i did n't read the description well enough , because a lot of spice/pepper/clove comes through instead . i found the spices to be overwhelming and left me with a bad aftertaste .

0.90 0.70 1.00 1.00 1.00	highland gaelic is my favorite beer , but i still want to review it . absolutely the best beer i 've ever had with food . seeing a pint glass of gaelic always makes me happy . nice creamy head in my 2009 masters tumbler fades to a little outside line of bubbles . looks like dark iced tea . roasted malts dissolve to west coast hops . go ahead , have 2 or 3 of 'em .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into red wine glass . a - reddish amber . while clear , there are large and numerous chunks of sediment floating around . a finger of off white head rises with moderate retention before falling to a thin cap . minimal lacing . s - dark , sweet , rich bread . faint notes of caramel and chocolate , along with a good deal of berries and other dark fruit . briney , almost vegetal aroma mingles with noticable alcohol and phenols . the combined result of the salty aromas approaches something like rubber and cheese . really interesting . t - strangely and disappointingly flavorless . not sure what happened here . modest sweetness starts off with some flat and subdued notes of bread crust and caramel . a little bit of alcohol pops up with faint phenols and some of the briney flavor from the nose . finishes with a mild bitterness . m - decent medium body with a moderate to soft carbonation . seems a little watery on the back end at times . d - fairly drinkable . not really bad from a flavor perspective , just extremely lacking . a pass overall with all the other great examples out there .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.90	looks beautiful . nice straw gold , big rolicking white head . settles slowly to a nice , dense , thin head . loads of white lacings coat entire glass . aroma is disappointing.slightly grainy , little bit of caramel sweetness . nothing special . grainy at first , gives way pretty quickly to caramel . finish could use some work , it just sort of ... ends . needs some hopping to bulk up the backend . nice smooth mouthfeel with good carbonation . very drinkable , nice for a hot summer day .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.80	while in alberta a few years ago , i had the chance to try kokanee gold , which i remember enjoying somewhat . unfortunately , the gold version does n't seem to exist east of manitoba , so i 've never actually had it since , and instead settled on some of the regular stuff . 473 ml tall-boy can . an aggressive pour produced a two-finger head , which quickly dissipated to lacing in a few minutes . the brew is a pale amber yellow colour - actually looks pretty good for what it is . the smell is pretty unimpressive - a bit hoppy , some alcohol . the flavour is alright , as far as macro lagers go . there is nothing really offensive ; it 's rather crisp with a hoppy finish . moderately high carbonation , and feels pretty thin in the mouth . it 's quite easy to drink down as well . as far as macro lagers go , this is a pretty solid entry , but do n't expect anything new or even particularly notable . at the same time , do n't expect much of anything particularly bad either .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.70	pour is perfect porter : jet black , huge off-tan head on top of it . smell is softer than i was hoping for though , lightly malty tones are evident with the vaguest hints of light fruit and chocolate , but i think the smell is quite subdued for the style , sub par . taste , big on the chocolate up front , this gives way to a sugary , roasted malt tone . citrus shows up on the back of the tongue about mid-way through , along with some wood tones . finish seems decent , good roasted tones sitting on the tongue . the taste on this is not bad , but it does n't really hit my sweet spot for porters . mouth : good stuff . plenty of bitters and this is a very full beer in the mouth , digging that . drinkability , ok but not remarkable . perhaps a shade above average . overall : arcadia has some hits and misses with me . this one is more of a miss . i think the flavours on this one are more subdued than i would like for the style , and it strikes me as one of the weaker locally brewed porters , hence , it 's unlikely that i 'll buy it again .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	had on tap at the bj 's in el paso , tx . a : served avertually black with a good two finger head that lasted quite a while and lots of lacing throughout . s ; has a mild roasted malt aroma with a good bit of sweetness mixed in . t : taste is a mixture of coffee , toffee and a hint of chocolate . fairly clean finish . f : full body , very cream and smooth . very well balanced.goes down very easy . o : excellent porter . at first i thought they had served me the stout by mistake . this is a lot more enjoyable than than most of the beers they serve . well worth a try .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	a-newer 50 cl can ( best by date was one day later than the rest on the shelf ) with a different motif . pours a light clear yellowish-gold w/bit of head that does n't stick around long , but leaves a thin lacing . s-faint pale malt , unidentifiable but undeniable light fruit notes , bits of grassy hops and slight skunky aroma , probably from the hops . i think this is the first time i 've ever written this , but the aroma seriously reminds me of urine . t & m-slightly sweet upfront w/bits of pale malt , and a slightly dry grassy/herbal finish . aftertaste is balanced w/faint residual sweetness lingering . carbonation is moderate and balance is good . light-bodied . d-fine , but this is the first time i 've had a beer that tasted okay , but smelled foul .

0.90 0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80	my weakness for english bitters got the best of me when i saw this one . here goes . very nice copper color . clear with low carbonation . thin lightly tanned creamy head leaves some nice lacing . slight medicinal aroma is mostly what im getting . even letting this warm and giving it a swirl isnt getting much aroma out of it . a bit of malt sweetness , but uninspiring otherwise . in spte of the mild aroma , the flavor comes through with what it needs . nice soft malt and hop presence which blend seamlessly . malt sweetness fills the palate and is washed away with a smooth bitterness . very nice and superbly balanced . a very nice beer only let down by the awol aroma .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	i 've had lots of american strong ales , but not many english ones . this one was clear and brown , with only a thin ring of head evident . aroma was of strong rich malt . no hops noticeable . it was nice . taste was primarily strong rich malt . there was a slight bitterness , with a little spiciness . the aftertaste was bitter , but there was a bit of a solvent taste as well . mouthfeel was smooth , and there was a fair amount of body to it . drinkability has to take a little hit because of the solvent flavor at the end . it was n't ethanol , and it definitely was n't an ester or diacetyl .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	brewed with northwest 2-row and caramel malts ( website says no wheat ) , hopped with perle and tettnager and feremented with red and black raspberries . pours out to a slightly hazy deep ruby red with bit o ' stuff hanging out..forming an off-pink soapy head with average retention and minimal lacing . carbonation is moderate . aroma is wonderful ... lots of raspberries , but not overdone like , say lindemanns , and not fake syrup like norwester . mouthfeel is flittering with a light body and very snappy finish . taste is like a decent golden ale with a well-balanced amount of raspberries thrown in . hardly any hop character ( hrmm ... that would be good ... a raspberry weizen ipa ) , with a mild amount of bitterness in the watery finish . malts are gamey and `` corny '' . i need more malt ! more hops ! this is decent stuff , but really would benefit from more malt and hops . thin body , very brief finish , and lacking a good `` beer '' taste . still , it 's one of the better raspberry ales out there .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.90 1.00	this beer is meant to drink from the can - my quintessential camping , fishing beer - so much better than other macro products- i 've had it on tap , but i got ta say , i like it better straight out of the can , and pretty cold at that - by those standards , this is my favorite all-day beer in the spring and summer months - a great value in a sweet beer !

0.80 0.50 0.90 0.60 0.70	very dark and opaque with a pleasant tan head that rings the glass . perfect visage of a dark beer . smell is malty , and vaguely sweet , with perhaps some piney hops . ca n't put my finger on it , but it 's not what i would hope . however , it delivers pretty well on taste . there 's nice malt , with just a touch of roastedness , and some chocolate-tabacco kinds of flavor . it 's biased on the sweet side and leaves a sticky sort of aftertaste that i do n't like , but it 's great going down . medium-bodied , good amount of carbonation and very smooth . this came from their sampler pack , and i think it 's the best of the lot .

0.80 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.40	( 1995 reserve ) as recommend on the accompanying card , i only pour a few ounces of the triple bock at room temperature . it pours like soy sauce , and looks exactly the same . there is absolutely no carbonation to speak of . swirling the liquid in a large burgundy glass , a thin yellow coating remains on the glass . even sitting two feet away from the glass , the aroma is very strong . it is very sweet with hints of very old wine and balsamic vinegar without the bite . the waves of the aroma come and go so infrequently that they seem to have a life of their own . bringing it to the nose , it is almost overpowering . it is sickly-sweet , with hints of molasses and vanilla . bringing it back through the nose into the back of the mouth , it already feels like i am drinking it : the smell is that strong and lingering . i think the best way to describe it is `` pungent . '' i am actually concerned about what i am about to drink the first taste is surprising : quite different from its aroma . it 's still sweet , but definitely a bit sour . it 's like drinking raisin juice , if such a thing existed . the mouthfeel is very odd , since i 've never had a beer that was n't carbonated : it has the consistency of thin maple syrup . it also tastes thinner than it smells . the aftertaste brings back hints of its aroma , which is not entirely pleasant . as i continue to drink , it now seems to get a little salty , bringing me back to my initial impression of its similarity in appearance to soy sauce . there is absolutely no hint of alcohol , which is surprising considering how much is contained in there . also , if hops were used to brew this , they sure are hidden well . since it was initially served at room temperature , it finishes exactly as it started . i remember the hype when the samuel adams triple bock was introduced around 10 years ago . having finally tried it , it is a mixed bag . it has an interesting taste , definitely the most malty-sweet brew i have ever had , but the other characteristics make this hard to recommend wholeheartedly .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70	this beer is lookin good . i just poured it in the glass and so far , it 's the best lookin pour i 've done in awhile . it looked like a thick , rich , dark amber with a perfect size head . ca n't wait to drink it ! ! ! but first , the smell ... very perfumy . not something i normally like . there seems to be some sweetness ( which is good for me ) but a lot of flowery aroma also ( which i do n't care for ) . not as excited as i was a minute ago to taste it ... but let 's give 'er a whirl , eh ? very hoppy . as far as ales go , this is a high quality drink . i can taste the carmalley malt in the background and i think it 's a pretty good balance . some bitterness in there also . i 'm kinda diggin on it . this is n't something i normally drink , but if i had to choose between pale ale 's , i 'd definitly roll with this one . as far as the drinkability goes , i think one or two is aboot as much as i could take , but note that i do n't care for ales as a whole . especially pale ales . i 'm trying to base my score off my knowledge and not my personal tastes , that 's why i gave it a good rating . after note : the more i drink it , the better it gets . maybe if i did drink a couple of them i 'd come around fully . i ai n't scared to try ! ! ! ! big gulp , warm belly , happy head , roll on yakk

0.70 0.80 0.70 0.50 0.40	22oz bomber from a friend for $ 5 ( he got it on sale ) . poured into a chouffe tulip . no dating info that i can find . appearance : very clear , goldish orange color . one inch of head recedes to about a quarter inch , then eventually just a layer . tight bubbles that stick to the glass in sparse patches at the top but no lacing otherwise . aroma : very musty , maybe some orange peel . lemongrass and some floral notes emerge after a bit . the best part of the beer in retrospect . taste : orange at first , maybe white grapes . definitely herbal too , but ca n't place what it is . sweeter than i expected in the middle but a semi-dry finish with the juicy citrus flavor apparent in the aroma sticking around . mouthfeel : lots of carbonation as expected , and very dry on the tongue in the finish . drinkability : not sure i 'd want to drink more than one of these ( kinda glad i split the bomber ) , but the abv is not apparent . it 's hard to give this beer average scores because it 's good , but just not good for the style or for the brewery . a decent wild ale to try once , but not worth seeking out .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60	poured a somewhat blush shaded cranberry into a tulip . has thin , slightly off-white head . i 'm not sure exactly how old the bottle i have is , but i would estimate mid to late nineties . smells exactly like strawberry jam with a very subtle hint of tartness . pure strawberry fruitiness with a slight tart bite . small bit of oaky/corkish flavor . fizzy and light , very thin . tangy finish . would be a nice treat on a hot day or with a snack ( i 'm having mine after work with a plate of samosas ) but never somethin i would drink more than one of , or more than one in a ... .say 72 hour period . if i wanted pop i 'd hit up a vending machine .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40	22 ounce bottle poured into a snifter . nice and clear amber-orange color with plenty of sticky head . smells of maple , bread , grassy hops , and a bit of apple . i only got a little maple in the initial taste , but plenty of malt sweetness . the finish is pretty dry and a little mouth puckering ( not from the hops , but the dryness ) . diacetyl comes through a little strong . i 'm pretty let down by the taste . the mouthfeel is much lighter than i expected it to me ranking in somewhere between light and medium . the carbonation level is medium . the finish is extremely dry . i do n't think i 'll be picking this up again , but at the ~ $ 5 for the bomber when i was looking to try something new i do n't regret the purchase .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	i 'm not a huge fan of the fruit beer movement , but this brew was recommended while i was on the bbc brewery tour . i gave it a shot and thoroughly enjoyed a fruit beer that combined the interesting characteristics of a strong dark ale with subtle , but significant raspberry flavors . the only comparison i can think of is three philosophers , and this brew blues that blend out of the water . it has a black/brown appearance with a fair head . the aroma is dominated by malt and raspberry . there are hints of chocolate to keep me interested . the flavor profile is more complex . while raspberry notes pop up occasionally , and dominate the finish , there is a significant coffee and chocolate presence in addition to some funkier sour notes . the brew is well bodied and quite drinkable , given its alcohol content .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.90	appearence : pours a dark brown with ruby hints . on top is a decent beige head that dies down to practically nothing . smell : smells nice and tasty , with chocolate and molasses notes . very little hop aroma , but still strong enough to balance the brew . taste and mouthfeel : the taste is typical of a porter . molasses and coffe notes , as well as chocolate , with decent hops and a bittersweet finish . but nothing stands out . it seems like something is missing to make this beer really stand out . the mouthfeel is medium-bodied , and a bit flat . drinkability and overall : like i said , this is a typical porter , with nothing wrong with it , but nothing making it stand out . with that said , it is highly drinkable , and one i would n't have a problem imbibing all night . not bad . thanks to rajendra82 for the bottle .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.80	after getting my ass severly kicked by the dogfish head 120 minute ipa , i had to take a serious break to detoxify my palate . after gearing myself up , i cracked my 60 minute ipa with great expectations . the beer pours to a generic goldish orange . its nose is bold and attention-grabbing with a deep , dank , tart hoppiness . this beer has a slight hint of a head that disappears immediately and leaves a lousy lacing . this dfh selection immediately slaps you in the face with its abruptly loud bitterness . i might have to say that this is the most bitter beer i 've encountered . most hoppy beers are at least rich with alcohol for a dynamic flavor . this one is just piney , spicey hops instead of the floral or fruity variety . one might argue that this beer has a slightly soapy taste with hints of astringency . there is no good maltiness to speak of here , and i 'm left thinking that the beer is punishingly hoppy without any redemption . that is , until i belch . best hops belch ever ! overall , a nice beer for the hop-junkies , but just not enough dynamic flavors here for me . i was left with the nagging feeling that there is something in here i just do not care for . i will keep seeking of dfh beers after two lackluster experiences with the 60 and 120 ipas . i 'm a huge 90 minute fan , though . maybe this particular choice had sat in my local pub for a few days too many .

0.70 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.80	pour : 12 oz bottle to pint glass . clear pale straw color with a decently formed white head . even leaves some lacing . nose : no skunk , just plain ol ' corn and grain . mouth : surprising heft of flavor . not as watery as your average pale lager . lightly toasted cereal grains with a touch of adjunct sweetness . inoffensive . semidry , sort of slimy and astringent on the palate . high drinkability , low desirability .

0.70 0.50 0.90 0.90 0.70	brownish red in a snifter.. oud bruinish in color . thick with unexpected carbonation all throughout . light lacing , very super sticky . smell is pure barleywine with hoppy fermentation and a sickly sweet tinge . taste is the ultimate in caramel , and smooth . abv is rather hidden , drinkable for dessert . burnt sugar is the phrase to best describe the taste . malty bitterness and butterscotch end the experience for you . some say 2005 is too late for this one , i think its perfect . i like em sweet . thx unionmade & ms. unionmade

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70	another drink sampled at the abc . the beer had a very dark appearance with a brown head which lasted a long time on the beverage . the aromas were much more oak-like than chocolate leading to a good taste but a bit disappointment in expected flavor . the taste was a bit frappe-like , however , making it a desert beer . however , the beverage did have a bitter aftertaste . the porter had a medium body with some fizzy carbonation when drank . in general , it was not as desert like as i hoped , but it was a good porter .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.50	the beer is cloudy red/pink , a light pink head recedes quickly , leaves no lacing . the smell is complex , earth , horse , stable , sour milk sweet berries . the taste does not deliver , some sourness , lemon , blueberries and a metallic note . medium carbonation , somewhat fizzy . this was hard to decide on , the smell was really intriguing , but taste more mediocre . an bit hard to imaging when it will be really good to drink .

0.60 0.30 0.80 0.70 0.90	one of my old favorite back in my cegep 's years . nice , lucid and yellow gold color , great carbonizations . a skunky smell , very skunky , but it make you love skunks ( that why pepe is cool ! ) . a good mouthfeel , nothing great , but not bad at all too . the taste is refreshing , light , with no great distinct aromas emerging from that beer . a good beer to drink lightly when you invite friends over .

0.90 0.30 0.60 0.30 0.30	12oz bottle courtesy of vonschplieffen into a duvel tulip . a : clear pale amber body with two fingers of creamy white foam . good retention and lacing . attractive . s : uggh . the first aroma to tease my nostrils is a sharp , acrid apple cider - like cider that 's been left out at room temp for a few days . it 's terrible , but intriguing . as i intrepidly inhale more of the ... odor , let 's stick with odor , the rotten apple gives way to straight silo - hot , rancid malt , like what i 'd expect from sticking my face into a horse 's feed bag . uniquely disgusting . t : i really do n't want to taste this , but here goes . yeah , this is awful . the gross fruitiness starts things off , followed by the dry , husky , astringent malt . as bad as the malt is , it 's better than the putrescent , acidic fruit . i love apple juice , but i so , so do n't want to let it curdle in the sun all week before mixing it with weak , grainy beer . this is absolutely horrid . m : surprisingly substantial body with moderate , sharp carbonation . a little sticky . i 'm impressed at the amount of body for a 4 % beer , but when the flavors sticking to my cheeks are so awful i wish they would just wash away cleanly . d : i 'm incredibly slow to drainpour a beer , but this one is absolutely trying my patience . everything about it is offensive , but it 's such a weak , light beer that the offensiveness can only go so far . i guess that 's good for this category ? maybe ? notes : this is the third cavalry beer i 've tried , and they just keep getting worse and worse . hatch plug was n't bad , nomad was poor , and this is just disgusting . i hear decent things about the big wally , but i ca n't say i 'm in any hurry to try it . i really want new ct breweries to succeed , but i ca n't imagine that they will if they do n't improve their offerings . the worst part is that i really do n't think that this beer is infected , but just really , really bad . buyer beware . cheers !

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	aroma was extremely muted . i honestly could barely decern anything ; malt or hop wise . if i almost put this beer in my nostrils i can get some light pine with some hints of citrus and pale malt . luckily the taste of this beer is better than the nose , but still nothing to write home about . bitterness is really the summary point of this beer which is the exact opposite of how i prefer my hops . i do appreciate the bitter finish but could not have more than a pint of this w/o having a cracker/pretzel to clean the hop resine off my tounge . his beer has an excellent bitter finish . the bubbly mouthfeel combined with the bitter ending is mildy enjoyable . this is a step down from most of the ipas i like but others may like like this more , me i 'm more of a hop aroma heavy guy , especially for a wet hopped ale .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60	appearance burnt orange snow globe . i 'm guessing yeast particulates float around the medium size bubbles . smell : grapefruit , peach , yeast when it warms . under-ripe orange with rind on the back mouthfeel : thicker and more yeast on the back of my throat than is normal for an dipa or i like from one . overall : not into it . why so much yeast . why boast hops when they are n't complex , well rounded , or that forward in the nose or flavor . yet it is n't malty enough to imagine they are hiding .

0.40 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.50	blueberries , blueberries and blueberries.that 's all i could smell and taste with this beer.yuck.this beer had a very small head that quickly diminished.the body was carbonated and slightly hazy.the hue was orange and there was very little lacing.the nose was what else ? blueberries ! the flavor was ? blueberries ! the mouthfeel was smooth , slightly tingly and light bodied.no thanks .

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.20	pours a cloudy dark orange . very small head with no retention at all . some spotty lacing though which is surprising . smells of banana and bread . some floral/citrus coming through also . taste is way off on this . extremely tart and sour . this is unlike any other oktoberfest i 've had , and i 'm not really sure about it . i was looking forward to this as i 'm in an 'fest ' mood , but this was dissappointing . a little metallic twang in there as well . i had to pour this one out , i 'm sorry to say . a little crisp with medium to high carbonation . watery and thin . this is just an unpleasant experience all around . i love supporting local craft breweries , but this is just wrong . i will not get this again . avoid .

0.60 0.90 0.50 0.60 0.80	poured an orange color , which surprised me because i was expecting purple or red from the raspberries . did n't have much head , but left lots of lacing . very carbonated , bubbles stream up from bottom almost like champagne . smells amazing ! smells like raspberry muffins , with the sweet and tangy fruity smell and the bread-y , yeast-y almost sour smell of muffins . does not taste nearly as good as it smells . raspberry taste is very muted , almost would n't even know it was there . really not a lot of flavor at all . mouthfeel is way too watery , even for me , and i prefer a lighter body . the carbonation is nice though . very drinkable , only because it 's so light . overall it 's ok , and i would buy it again , especially considering its price . if only it tasted as good as it smelled .

0.80 0.30 0.80 0.60 0.70	i had to get a bottle of this so i could see why it was so terrible . i kid ! here comes a review with the open-est mind i can muster ... looks to be an orange , apricot color with a light , chilly haze that makes me try to wipe condensation off my pint that is n't there . the head is an irregular film of tiny bubbles , sustained by a fleet of little bubbles rushing up in columns from the bottom . smell is non-existent ! after a few sniffs , i began to wonder if i had a head cold . upon further review and a little beer on/up my nose , i detect musky old basement and corn chips mixed with ambiguous citrus zest and cheap triple sec . even if this was prominent , it would still be repulsive . the flavor definitely reminds me of bud , with old corn chips and mold , but this has a more prominent slick graininess , that reminds me a bit of a hefe . sadly , the `` spices '' taste very artificial , like cheap , fake , orange candy and orange zest followed by a hint of ... maybe nutmeg . it 's some indistinct spice ( that probably is n't real ) . feels bold and silky with a gentle swarm of carbonation that is really quite well done . but , this leaves an odd film in my mouth . this is n't really too bad and definitely a step up from bud light regular . i do n't think i 'll ever try this again , but it was worth the experience .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	poured out of a 12oz bottle into a sierra nevada pint glass . a - amber colored with a thick white head that lasts quite a while . the head rose out of the top of the glass and was nice and fluffy . leaves some real nice lacing on the way down . s - did n't really smell a whole lot . i smell the hops , but nothing too disctinct . t - relatively bitter from the hops , medium bodied . the bulk of flavor is typical of an ipa - pine and citrus balanced by malts . seems to be a great example of an ipa . there 's all the traditional flavors and body typical of the style , but it does n't kill your mouth with too many hops and unbalanced flavor . m - you can feel the carbonation and it is medium bodied . leaves on a crisp note without making you pucker or feel like you need a glass of water . d - the reasonable alcohol content makes this one a very drinkable brew . overall , i 'm liking this pale ale more for what it lacks than what it has . it seems to be getting tougher and tougher to find a ipa with some hops that does n't beat you up with unbalanced sharpness and dryness .

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.90	poured this 25.4 oz . green bottle into a tripel karmeliet glass . no date on the label or cork . i have had this bottle since 6/07 . a gentle slow pour revealed a crystal clear yellow gold body . a huge crisp white head developed despite the delicate pour . this slowly faded to a film . the second pour clouded the body to a butterscotch color . smell was like 7-up only fruitier . very interesting . concrete and ginger . peaches blossomed as it warmed . i could smell this one all night . taste was lightly tart . fruit . sump-pump water , you know cool , still and infused with concrete ! not that i have ever tasted water from the sump-pump . refreshing and smooth but a bit more bland than i expected based on the wonderful aroma . nicely mellow and subtle . mouthfeel was a bit thinner and less carbonated than expected . medium to light bodied .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	a : clear gold , four finger head of moderate thickness , nice color . smell : the aromas definitly give out hints of grass and grain with small hints of hops and malts . t : pretty average , getting the malt upfront , then finishes with light hops . pretty balanced . nothing crazy , just pils . m thin , carbonation is low .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70	graperuit had both tap and bottle tap is amazing - bottle is decent i would almost argue that they put grapefruit juice in this beer . it is really good ... just much better on tap than in bomber . if it 's on tap , get it . it tastes great ... it smells better . warning ... it will knock you on your ass .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.70	a new beer from arcadia , just sampled at ashley 's in ann arbor . it 's supposedly a witbier heavily flavored with raspberries -- and just a touch of honey . the berry aroma is all-consuming . 8 inches from my nose , it 's attacking my nostrils like a schoolbully . mixed with a mild citric floral quality . definitely dominated by fruit -- tangy berries especially . the flavor is likewise berry-esque . the witbier is lost underneath mounds of candied , cooked , sugared raspberries . for what they 're trying to do , it 's not bad , so i 'll certainly rate this as an above-average beer . if i 'm picking raspberry seeds out of my teeth with new glarus rapsberry tart or lindemans framboise , i 'm picking the raspberry jolly rancher wrapper out of my teeth with this one . intensely fruity . probably too much so considering the lack of oompf to the base beer . tastes a little too engineered . but you could definitely get some wine cooler fans to have one or two if you wanted to . and oh yeah , the name is a pun . a very obvious pun . ha . ha ha .

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.70	11.2 oz bottle poured into westmalle goblet . pours a dirty amber color with a huge yellowish head that fills the entire goblet and leaves cottony cloudlike chunks of lace all over the glass ... completely covered . the smell is fruity and funky sweet . i get hints of candi sugar , tart apple , sour grape , star anise , dried orange/lemon zest , light tree bark , and clove . tons going on here in addition to the funkiness of the brett . just layer after layer of aroma . the taste is very funky upfront followed by a musty spicy sweetness . get some notes of fennel and bitter grapefruit . the taste is somewhat champagne-like in its dry crispness that is a little more of a funky dryness . mouth is fairly prickly and somewhat detracts from the tasting . i wish there was a little less carbonation and foam here . overall drinkability is nice with pretty agressive brett flavor that makes it difficult to work through . however , i enjoy each sip . probably could n't do more than one of these , but i like the one i have .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	served in a brandy sniffer as directed by the bottle . i 'm drinking this at about a year old . unfortunately i never tasted it fresh , so i ca n't make any comparisons . the beer is a reddish brown with a light tan head that disappears very quickly and leaves a few spots of lacing . the aroma is strong thick sweet and syrupy . including pine , alcohol , vanilla and oak . even after a year the hop flavor is still strong and up front . the malt sweetness comes next followed by strong hop bitterness . the bitterness hangs on a bit long and throws the balance off a bit . there also seems to be a bit of oak flavor , though the label does n't mention barrel aging . mouthfeel is moderately thick and typical of of a barleywine . overall it 's very nice , i 'd like to see how it would do with another year or two to tame the hops down .

0.70 0.30 0.80 0.60 0.50	a - minor touch of light through the center of glass . tight off-white head that falls quickly . s - smells off . some malt and chocolate but no coffee . instead , there is a strong wet bar-rag smell . t - bitter chocolate , malts and a touch of coffee . luckily the wet-rag bit did not translate to the flavor . m - medium coating with a tingle over entire tongue . d - maybe one as the scent is quite off putting .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	40z . brown bagged . a : appears to be a brown bag with a bit of brown bottle prairie doggin ' . s : smells kind of light a dive ... stale beer and mildew-y cardboard/paperbag . a bit of sweetness probably from corn but maybe rice . t/m : it actually has a surprising amount of flavor . some biscuit and cereal malts that transition smoothly into a grainy , almost husky malt . is that a wisp of grassy hops ? maybe i 'm already drunk . body is medium light with slightly elevated carbonation . d : 5.9 % is pretty low for a malt liquor . this was n't nearly as bad as i thought it 'd be . at least pretty good sippin ' from the bottle , crouchin ' on the corner , shootin ' dice with ashy larry . tyrone biggums ? ! ? ! ? ! this is not cocaine in a can and no you can not taste my penis . now get over here , ronda !

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.90	paid $ 4.49 for a bomber from bevmo in san jose , ca . poured into a large snifter to review . small off white head that dissipates quickly . beer is dark brown in color . no retention , minimal lacing . a nice balanced nose with caramel malts , floral hops and a nice dose of sweetness coming from tropical fruits . the fruitiness keeps reminding me of pink bubblegum . taste is equally balanced with that same strange tropical fruitiness/bubblegum that i just ca n't seem to pinpoint . medium body and a slick mouthfeel . nice carbonation levels and a medium length finish of balanced caramel malt and floral hops . oh yeah , and there 's that odd sweetness lasting into the finish as well . overall a very enjoyable beer , and somewhat unique as well . hats off to lagunitas .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	poured into a pint glass , clear with a light copper color . the head was thick , dense , a bit off white . a.very tempting looking beer . the aroma was clean , woody , spicey , and fruity . the taste was caramelly , nutty , chocolaty , and fruity.a nice well balanced taste . a light , smooth mouthfeel with a clean light sharp finish and a touch of dryness . a very clean an refreshing taste.you ca n't get any more drinkable than this . the perfect everyday beer.the perfect beer to give to the bmc drinker wanting to try something different .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.60	poured from 12oz bottle into a pilsner styled glass . appearance- huge head of froth , quite unexpected but welcome . fills the glass with froth with tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass . beer color is a golden amber that is downright appetizing to look at . lacing is marginal . i actually am looking forward to tasting this beer . smell- a slight hint of pumpkin and spice . not quite as much as i was hoping for here . a very light malt aroma , much more hop than anything else . taste- pumpkin and spices are upfront . maltiness comes second . very bitter in the hops department . this is not a style where hop bitterness would show up well . i do n't hate it , but this is n't a beer i could drink easily . mouthfeel- there is a sourness in the aftertaste that really does n't stick with me well . the first pumpkin taste upfront was quite nice , but it was all downhill from there . drinkability- well , this would be some very drinkable stuff , but that sourness hits and it gets all watery on my tongue . given the choice of one blue moon beer above all others , i would take the wintertime seasonal . i looked long and hard for this one , and it came up as a disappointment when i finally got a taste . worth a try , but not worth a repeat .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.70	poured into pint glass dark brown almost black in color , no head at all . big chocolate smell , hint of coffee . like the smell a big rush of dark chocolate with a touch of coffee flavor followed by a bit of an alcohol taste . lingering sweetness stays in the mouth . light carbonation , rich and thick . definitely lives up to the mokah name , a little too sweet and chocolaty for me .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80 1.00	moderately cloudy , yellowish champagne color ... a little darker than . what little head there was quickly dissipated . moderate carbonation . not to prettiest beer i 've seen , but here we go . there 's a tangy and sweet ; champagne-like smell . a little syrupy . nice , but not a strong smell overall . fruity , peach taste ; again , tangy , but not too sour . it 's really almost like i 'm drinking champagne at this point . there 's a very slight saltiness on the back and sides of the tongue as it goes down . unexpected but pleasant . nothing new comes out as it warms a bit . this beer is dry and light , but far from watery . tingly carbonation . very refreshing . not my favorite , overall , but a great summer beer . could be enjoyed in the blistering noon heat , or in cooler summer nights . i hope to see this beer next year .

0.70 0.20 0.50 0.20 0.20	i picked this up as a joke recently and had my friends laughing hysterically because i was taking notes . silver 24 oz tallboy can with the message , `` extra malted barley and select hops for extra gravity '' and `` slow brewed for exceptional smooth flavor . '' we shall see about that . also had written on it , `` 8.1 % abv . '' poured into my mug a golden tan body , so we are off to a pretty good start . but then the head disappeared very quickly . scent was lemony mixed with medicine and a chemical smell that i ca n't quite put my finger on . it sort of reminded me of the lemon scented dishwasher detergent under my sink . a vaguely creamy mouthfeel that starts out ok but then the taste hits and it tastes just like it smells . the mouthfeel then becomes this thick , creamy , lemony , chemical that overpowers . harsh aftertaste , sort of like milwaukee 's best but with the corn turned up to 11 and intentionally excessive amounts of alcohol . im getting a buzz after only 5 or has it been 6 sips . i pour a little more into my mug . this is so revolting to me that i am going to have to resort to chugging to get the pain and suffering over with . i was going to review more beers today but after the steel reserve and its cough syrupy character my tastebuds are annihilated . i want to appologize for bashing this beer . it had been probably 8 years since i last drank this stuff and i was thinking that since my taste in beer has matured over the years i would now be able to appreciate even this beer as long as i kept the style in mind . i do like strong beers , double bocks , smoked porters , and barleywines , but this did n't work for me ; i 'm just not into this style anymore . this beer brought to mind times long gone by of when i sat with my crusty punk friends in old dilapitated houses drinking this or camo or magnum and being very disrespectful to beer . this is why i did n't like beer until i was 25 , because this was all i was ever exposed to . i even had a hangover the following day , and i only get those on new years and the day after my birthday . beer almost never gives me a hangover and to get one from just one 24oz can .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	a . deep amber in color . even with an fairly aggressive pour there 's very little head . s. malty , with a hint of hops . most distinctive is a strong spice scent . t. sweet , and again malty and spicy , with the hops much more prominent than in the smell . the smell and taste greatly compliment each other . m. nothing incredibly distinctive here . stronger carbonation than i prefer . o . a great wintertime beer . i can see myself enjoying several of these next to a fire on a sleepy snowed-in weekend . could n't see myself drinking these outside the late fall/winter months ( but it 's a seasonal brew anyway .

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	on a soccer trip deep into southeast pa i came across this local brewery and bought a case of this brew . very pleasant on the palate and no aftertaste . very nice body . a tad sweet . color and smell is nothing to get excited about . no doubt ... if i can find it again..i will buy again .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	pours a dark honey brown with some buttery head and decent bubbling . looks pretty refreshing for a barleywine and not as thick as i 'd expect with the bubbly . smells not so much and like ripe guava ( combination of the hoppy cirtus and sweet frutiness ? ) with hints of peppered rye . pretty lacing ( for a barleywine ? i know , crazy ... ) . tastes delicious . good citrus and sweetness up front with a lingeringly bitter , intensely malty ending , meaty rye flavors throughout . carbonation is small and tickling in otherwise smooth mouthfeel . unexpectedly , it is just as thick as the next barleywine i 've come across . sizeable alcoholic warmth . for a barleywine , this is dangerously drinkable but also a fair sipper . the rye is pervasive but not offensive and i would expect more overall intensity for a sipper-type . this one 's a keeper , worth getting more of .

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.80	i 'm coming back to review an old stand-by for me . a - pale brown translucent - a little bit of paler brown . huge nitro head that sticks like crazy and holds atop the beer . s - nitro-metalic smell - malty underneath with very little hop smell . t - good balance . 'flatter ' than the color suggests and hoppier too . there 's more bitter here than i first thought before i tried it . not a heavy tasting beer at all . mf - after the nitro fades , it 's pretty watery . it 's got that cool watery 'coldness ' - it 's hard to describe . d - you could drink these all night - the 5.2 % abv makes it a good session beer - but the taste is pretty distinct and the watery mouthfeel would make you turn to something else . of course , maybe that 's just my adhd - i have a hard time imagining drinking only one beer all night . heck , as we speak , my refrigerator has 12 different types of beer ! ( i just read the style blurb and i now realize it 's the 'hard water ' that causes the 'cold watery ' mouthfeel . review edited accordingly ) .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60	this one pours a dark brown color with a small head that falls away to nothing very quickly and does n't leave any lacing on the glass . appears to have very low carbonation . the aroma is very roasty and has plenty of chocolate notes . smells very nice . the flavor is a bit more oily than i expected . the roasted is subdued and the chocolate is there , but there is an oily thinness . i enjoy the flavor , but it 's lacking something . the mouthfeel is thin of the style in my opinion . the drinkability is just ok .

0.60 1.00 0.50 0.80 0.80	drank from a 12 fl . oz . bottle purchased at connecticut beverage mart , newington , ct label read : bottled on 9/16/06 poured a translucent black with mocha colored highlights at the fringes of the glass . the thin film of fizz ( no head to speak of ) quickly faded to a tiny ring of lace . aroma was outstanding . rich and full with dry , whole grain oats and sweet , cereal-like notes ( kind of like sticking your nose in a box of quaker oats ) . deep roasted malts and some peaty smokiness were apparent as well . the taste was full-flavored with strong , dry , oatmeal-like characteristics as well . some faintly detectable caramel malts up front before the oats and distinct dryness became apparent . the flavors became more intense as they moved to the rear of the palate , with dark roasted malts , espresso/burnt coffee notes and a noticeable hop bite leaving the palate feeling bone dry . deep , roasted malts and toasted oats carried into the long-lived aftertaste . mouthfeel was medium bodied ( thinner then expected ) and a bit flat . drinkability however was quite good . i do n't think i have had an oatmeal stout that had such strong , oatmeal-like characteristics . while this beer has its imperfections , its near perfect balance of flavors combined with its light body made for a pleasant and memorable drinking experience .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured from a 12oz bottle into a sa perfect pint . appearance ; light straw colored yellow with a big fluffy but light head . nice lacing down the glass . unfiltered and not transparent . smell : muted aromas of corriander , rosemary covered with lemons . not much going on here . smells a bit fake as well . taste : very refreshing and light . good complex flavors of toasted bread , corriander , banana and lemons . mouthfeel : slightly overcarbonated for my liking . also a slight astringenty aftertaste that leaves the mouth dry . drinkability : move over blue moon . this is a nice example of a pale wheat ale . seek this out and drink over blue moon any day .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	picked this up sort of randomly . liked the name and label . a munich dunkel too.. cool to see some microbreweries making that . have n't had too many of those since i was in germany last . pours a dark iced tea brown with a frizzy head with maybe a little too much carbonation because i had to pour this very slowly . very good lacing and clarity . no visible carbonation . not exactly `` blackened '' ... more like `` browned '' .. does n't sound as fun . i 'm digging the aroma a lot . subtle smokiness with raisins and some crystal malt . the makings of a great dunkel . taste is a dunkel just like you 'd find in germany , if maybe a little short . hints of the strength of the dark crystal , smoke , all on a very smooth pilsner base . a little cardboardy in the finish , which makes it come off as stale or oxidized but not too bad . a little too much residual sweetness , could finish a bit drier , but the sweetness is accentuated by the very creamy and smooth mouthfeel . a little more carbonation would perk things up as well . a good take on a munich dunkel . one of the better ones i 've had in the states .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	this seems at first smell to be a heffeweizen , but after the first sip , you realize it 's an ipa style pale ale . overall an excellent beer . appearance : reddish orange . not much red mind you , but not totally orange either . excellent coloring , just what you 'd expect a high quality beer to look like . 4.5/5 smell : lemon , orange , hops , wheat . it really reminds me of the nose i get off a really good heffeweizen ( spelling might be wrong , but there ya go ) . it 's a bright and inviting smell and makes my mouth water . 5/5 taste : bitter sharp lemon comes in strong with a hint of floral hops in the background . it 's a very good strong taste without any of the funky metal aftertaste that sometimes follows the lemony taste . smooth , but bold at the same time . although the lemon is a little overstated . 4/5 mouthfeel : thin , but not watery . it could be a little thicker without damaging the effect , but i 'm not complaining . 4/5 overall : a good solid beer for a good price . there are many better beers on the market , and it 's definitely not for everyone , but for the price you absolutely ca n't go wrong . 4.5/5

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	thanks to julian for this one . poured a 22oz bomber into my chimay chalice ( 2 pours ) . this beer pours a murky , orange amber with a sticky , white head . this beer has really pretty lacing . almost looks french . the aroma is oddly sweet . the floral nature of the jasmine really comes out in the nose . i really do n't know if the sweetness comes from the jasmine or the malt . not much hops in the aroma . wow , the jasmine really works well in this beer . its big yet sublet . the crazy thing is hops really do n't come through at all . they really play second fiddle to the jasmine . the mouthfeel is full bodied with a light carbonation . this is a really easy drinking , different ipa . honestly , if i did n't know that it was an ipa , i probably would never have guessed because the hops are really subdued . as a note , i had this beer on tap at the spuyten duyvil and i found it much better .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.90 0.90	the brew pours a hazy orange with a tinge of red . really , im sirius . a creamy , eggshell colored head fades fast . okay so i wrote it smells creamy and i guess i meant it smelled like cream . anyhow , a light creamy and fresh citrus hop scent tickles my nose . however , the smell is very light . and though the idea of cream and citrus doesnt sound so good , it was really very pleasant . more of that odd cream/citrus mixture is present in the flavor . the brew is tart and sweet like sweet and sour pork from the oriental food place near my houseokay , so maybe not like sweet and sour pork . the sweetness in the brew isnt your typical orange/grapefruit hop sweetness that were all used to in our american pales ( though i have no idea what style of beer this is ) , but more of a candy flavor paired with the hop tartness . it is interesting , and good . this might be way out there but i think i also detect some spicy pepper flavors in there as well . in the mouth the beer feels silky and thick . i could drink this beer all daybut id be dead if i tried . this is a good beer . really , im sirius .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	i bought this beer at a christmas market in avignon , france . i served it in a beer snifter . look- it poured a nice straw colour , quite fizzy . had a bad head retention but it did lace ok. nose- very lagery and hoppy ! reasonably fresh and a little bready and a touch smokey . taste- big pils malt taste , although still quite refreshing . lemon and malt flavours really dominate this beer . mouthfeel- very thin but matches the style really . drinkability- very quaffable but not really groundbreaking . could be a session beer if served on tap but i dont really get its purpose when it is bottled . seems like its too focused on the marketing and the nice pictures on the bottle than the actual product .

0.70 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	my first rye . poured a big ol ' head which took a while to die down to 1 '' . brown but unlike so many typical browns i 'd call this sort of a warm burnt umber . the smell struck me as among the likes of a strong imperial ipa . yet the taste was a lot less hoppy than ipas , more typical average beer . and yes i 'd say there are some flavors in common with rye-based whiskey .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	a- deep dark brown with a thin lace of a tan head that sticks around and leaves some lacing . s- very complex with sweet milk chocolate predominating mixed with a good amount of raisin , smells like a raisin candy bar in a good way . also in the mix are light espresso , vanilla and whipped cream . t- not as complex as the nose but still tasty . lots of chocolate with a finish of the whipped cream , the other flavors seem lost in the mix . it 's a little like drinking chocolate milk and even more so like melted chocolate ice cream . m- smooth and creamy . it 's not the perfect creaminess that some stouts accomplish but it certainly comes close to the mark . d- this is a good beer that i would be happy to have again , in fact i 'm gon na have another one right now , but in the end i 'd give it up to try something new in a heartbeat .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	this 2004 stone imperial russian stout poured and inky black with a small dark tan head on top . the foam faded quickly to a thin ring around the glass leaving a few spots of lace behind . a malty aroma with some notes of coffee and nuts greeted me before my first sip . this medium to full bodied beer is smooth on the tongue . the roasted malt flavor is blended nicely with some coffee , chocolate and nut tastes . towards the end some sour cherry and alcohol flavors mix in and remain behind after each the beer is gone . this is a very good full flavored beer that hides it 's 10 % alcohol very well .

0.60 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90	pours an orangish-amber into a pint glass with very little foam . smell is very faint - a little bit of strawberry , and not much else . the taste , however , is just fantastic . the wheat beer flavor is at the forefront , but the strawberry smooths it out wonderfully . it 's not overly sweet , nor is it entirely fruit-foreward like some other fruit beers ( i.e . new glarus . ) a surprising find , and worth a try if you see it .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70	this beer is pretty big . the actual abv . is 23 % and you can smell it , almost like a whisky nose . not much on the nose exept alcohol and a little molasses . the viscous is like a thick dessert wine , this is just a dessert beer . the mouthfeel is alot better than the nose , taste of anise , maple and sweet , sweet malts . the sweetness is the only thing that covers all that alcohol.i recommend everyone to at least try this beer , just for what it is . but at $ 9.19 a 12 oz . bottle not everyone will , i would rather have a bell 's expedition stout .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured from a bomber into a tall pilsner glass . the beer poured a clear golden color with decent carbonation forming a 1 inch white head with minimal but noticeable lacing throughout . the smell was malty but faint , nothing strong jumping off the beer . the taste was nice with a hoppy malt mix that finished with hints of alcohol . the beer was light bodied and crisp with nice carbonation throughout . i would fit this into the session category with the second one tasting just as good as the first .

0.70 0.30 0.80 0.40 0.80	i never heard of this lambic before so i ordered it on a whim that i might have found something good . it was kind of a let down though . the color is a very bright cherry red with a white head . it smelled like red jell-o . that basically turned me off from it right there . i was about to just pass it on to someone else at the table without even tasting it . i took a sip and it was pretty sweet with a slightly tart finish to it that i liked a little . the jell-o smell carried over into the taste as well . it really drank quite well for such a sweet lambic though . after i finished it , i did n't feel like i just guzzled a glass of grenadine . it was okay to try for a sweet lambic but i would n't have it again .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 1.00	i have a new favorite beer ! ! ! ! i ordered a pint of this at my local flying saucer and was kindly rewarded for trying something new . appearance - very rich amber/red colors with a nice 1/2 '' - 3/4 '' head smell - slightly hoppy but not a very strong smell taste - sweet and smooth with no bitterness mouthfell - very smooth and pleasant . heavier than a lager but not as heavy as some irish ales . drinkability - this stuff is very easy to guzzle . i could almost drink it like water it goes down so smoothly . everyone sitting with me at my table tried this and everyone ( non-beer drinkers included ) was very impressed . this is now my go-to beer ! ! ! !

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60	source/serving : 650ml bottle dated 2/19/2010 ( 6 months old ) smell : delicate and complex , but not dynamic . crisp orange citrus and wine drive most of the content with the orange aroma very real-life . light herbal hops blend with a tart white wine note and sail high above the rest of the flavors . spice are complex and lay low in the background along with a touch of yeast , banana , and vanilla . very nice overall . taste : decent , but not quite on par with the nose . carbonation is over the top though the bubble burst with fresh citrus/grape/pineapple goodness on the tongue . starts out with lightly sweet and sour orange that is mellow and restrained . these mix with moderate spiciness that has decent depth but is mostly coriander and pepper . more like white wine in character than juice . dries out in the middle a bit with continued spice but elevated yeast and bread character with just a hint of caramel . finish has a deep lemon/orange oil character and rich spiciness of increased depth and complexity ( definite pepper ) that melds with light brett . character . dries out as expected but does n't ever get too dry . has a pleasant lightly fruity white wine type high note . at only 6.5 % this went straight to my head and is remarkably vinous . note : for me this is not as refreshing as most saisons .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	pours a clear pale orange color with a fluffy off white head that falls slow and laces well . aroma is crisp blend of citrus and hops slightly sweet , wonderful . best part of the beer do do n't drink this on out of the bottle pour it or you will miss out . taste notes of sweet citrus an honey fade in to bitter hops you would expect from a good irish pale ale leaving a subtle but linger bitter finish mouthfeel moderately carbonated somewhat mild body . drinkability very good refreshing perfect for a hot afternoon

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	dark amber colour , clear and bright . some dms , malt , toffee and something nutty on the nose . flavour - intriguing mix of caramel , toffee , chocolate , nut and something hard to pin down . apparently the wattle seed is roasted and ground ( according to flyer ) - definite roast flavour but do n't know if that 's the seed or the malt or the combination . low hop , malt driven beer . best thing about this beer is the silky rich mouthfeel . do n't perceive 5.8 % alcohol in flavour but felt it after a few schooners ...

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50	9.3oz extra thick wide-bodied , narrow-necked corked bottle . brew in 2001 . it pours a cloudy , orange-tinged , dark amber with just a few passing bubbles . the malt flavor is a bit of a disappointment . the taste of caramel and toffee , while in the aroma , is lacking in the flavor . instead , tastes of tart apples , karo syrup , lemon juice , and vinegar and salt come through . the rich sweet caramel aroma gives promise of a good malty , aged stock ale . a damp earthy smell carries the odor of fermented apple cider and more distantly , citrusy hops a citrusy tartness and slight sour taste sort of counter the sweetness , but in an unbalanced , pointless way . do n't let the fancy packaging fool you . this brew lacks character and a beginning foundation .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours black with a thick , creamy , large bubbled cappuccino head . the aromas promise a dandy ; juicy dark fruit ester , roasted coffee , pineapple , chocolate powder and molasses , and hints of bubble gum . a silky mouthfeel , slightly oily , and a sharp carbonation that does n't bite too hard is quite enjoyable . dark fruits , plum , sweet tobacco notes and some coffee and cocoa but not like the nose indicated . a heavy dose of fruity , piney , citric hops is little off balance and lingers in the aftertaste . alcohol starts hot but softens as it warms allowing for easy drinking .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70	as dark as a doppelbock gets , and with great head and lacing , this ayinger creation is pretty damn smooth . the smell is what really blows me away . it 's burnt malts , sweet , but then there 's some sort of tang i ca n't place . almost sour.. or funky . it 's distinct . taste is great too - the sweetness continues with some nice hop notes in the middle . it fills the mouth - the bubbles take care of that more than the body . with the low abv and the nicely complex taste , this one is a redrinker if you 're into it . to be honest , i 'm not that much . it 's a little off for me . i could see someone drinking a whole pack to figure out the taste . but i only bought one . so i 'll just content myself with looking at the nice little animals on the front of the bottle .

0.90 0.50 1.00 0.90 0.90	hazy honey color with a thin head that was surprisingly sticky and persistent . bit malty in the nose . hop aromas were floral but more muted than i would 've expected . mostly a sweet bready malt . really nice grapefruity hop flavor predominates . there 's a sweet malt undertone . nice bitterness . mouthfeel is spot on . carbonation , alcohol burn , body , ca n't fault anything here . overall , this is a beautiful beer and highly recommended .

0.80 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30	this beer pours like any other beer and looks like any other beer but unfortunately thats where it ends . it has a bad smell , but i do n't like pumpkins so ultimately this beer review may not be fair . the smell of pumpkin and spice is over whelming , and not good . taste is not as overpowering as the smell , and if i hold my nose and drink it is n't nearly as bad . overall i really dont like it at all , it stinks , but to be fair to o'falllon i dont like fruit/vegetable beers .

0.80 0.70 1.00 1.00 0.90	appearance : golden , clear , medium head , and high carbonation smell : grapefruit and melon dominate taste : honey , melon , hops , and some florals mouthfeel : way smooth and sweet for most of it -- then there is a bitter aftertaste which lingers in the mouth long after most aftertastes are gone . drinkability : another win for founders . i was blown away by this beer . the alcohol is excellently hidden ... if not for the high abv i would have several . an excellent beer for the style and for all beers .

0.60 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.60	initial impression from the pour does not impress , as there is not much aroma and little head retention . the first sip reminds me a bit of sam adams boston lager , but that quickly fades as the long malty finish disappoints . there is a touch of sweetness to this medium bodied clear amber lager , but it leaves me wanting for more . while it may be a better alternative to the mass market lagers , i 'll not pursue it again .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.30	thanks to chadquest for this brew , first one i 've had from flossmoor station . this may be called a brown ale , but it appears jet black with a coffee scum head that dissipates quickly leaving some swirls and decent lace . nose is of the coffee variety , with some roasted malt behind it . it 's mostly coffee though with a touch of earthy oats . very pleasant nose and a good rubbery cafe that is enough to carry the aroma . taste starts a bit metallic , and in this case it hurts , but after that its a balanced blend of coffee , semi-sweet malts , and molasses to finish . this is definitely a stronger than usual brown ale , and it 's ok to be strong , but combined with the long-lingering sucking-on-zipper metal the taste suffers a great deal . it 's unfortunate because the other flavors are really solid and i wish i could fully experience them . mouthfeel is more sticky and thick than your average brown ale , and it might be too much for some , but i happen to enjoy it . the molasses is very imposing in terms of taste and mouthfeel , and it can get a bit much . drinkability is harmed a great deal by the metal and uneven alcohol strength/molasses . this beer could be so much better that it 's disappointing to point out its shortcomings . i feel bad giving this such a low score since i can see how good it could be , but i could n't get through too much of this beer ( thanks to awyeh for jumping in to finish the job ) .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.50	my first kuhnhenn , and my 100th review . thanks to fear025 ( jay ) for this beer . april 2009 bottling . poured into a new holland high gravity series glass . pours a muddy deep brown with no head what so ever . evidence of carbonation , just no head . aromas of dark fruits ( raisins , prunes ) . smells like an aged , oxidized barleywine . also some aromas of cherry pits ( ? ) . first sip is alcohol , dark fruits , a little sweetness . again , reminds me of an aged high gravity beer , barleywine , or a thomas hardy from the 90s . alcohol burn is very harsh . as it warmed , there were some notes of cherries and dark chocolate . mouthfeel is full and coating . a little cloying . not that drinkable . i 'll finish the bottle , but you would n't want to drink this all night long . it 's more of a sipper .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 1.00	i know sam adams is somewhat of a love/hate brewery on this site and i fall more into the 'love ' camp . i think they make some damn fine beers , for the most part , especially considering how big they are . i 'm a big fan of winter beers , especially spiced ones . thank goodness for the wide availability of this one , so when i go to places that have mediocre at best selections , this can still usually be found ; in the winter that is , of course . appearance is a clear dark orange , with a small head and a little lacing . smell is almost non-existant to me . taste is something else : quite tasty , obviously on the malty side , with some cinnamon coming through . seems better then i recall it being in the past . very smooth on the palate ; seems to be going down faster then most beers i drink . like most good beers , it tastes best as it warms a little . could stand to be heartier in body and alcohol for a ww , but the way it stands , its quite tasty and drinkable . i 'd never refuse one ... unless there was something better of course ; )

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70	thanks to zorro for this one . 12 oz . stubby bottle poured into a nonic . pours a hazy burnt orange with a white one finger fluffy head that slowly dies down a thin layer . stickiness is pretty good with spotty lacing on the sides of the glass . smell is very peppery/spicey hop odor , not too appealing . almost has a rancid lemon like smell to it . taste was n't what i had expected after the smell . starts off with a very smooth mild earthy hop flavor , very pleasing . taste then smooths out with some malty goodness and finally ends up quite dry and bitter , pretty complex flavors . light to medium chewy mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation . i could probably drink a few of these as long as i did n't smell them .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60	a - poured the color of grapefruit ( pink ) with a small white head that quickly died down . s - berry and more berry t - strong raspberry flavor , but very little beer flavor . some sips almost tasted like watered down kool-aid . it reminds me of ab wildblue m - thin and watery , nothing particularly special i 'm conflicted on many of my ratings for this beer because on the one hand , many of the attributes of this beer are on purpose ( like the pink color ) but at the same time , it 's not a beer i would pick up again . it falls solidly in the category of wildblue and leine berry weiss

1.00 0.70 0.30 0.30 0.30	i had really high hopes for this beer . i love the founders imperial stout and the breakfast stout , so i was really excited to try the kbs . the kbs poured a rich black color . to me the smell was a little overpowering . this seemed more of a sipping beer and not a gulper . the alcohol taste was too overpowering to enjoy and it nearly masked the hints of coffee and chocolate .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	growler poured into a tulip glass . a- translucent gold , with thin white foamy head which dissipates leaving a little lace . s- lots of yeast , some citrus notes . t- crisp yeasty , bready , earthy , some citrus acidity . m- champagne like , quite a bit of carbonation . o- pretty standard example of a saison , good but not great . i like this better from a bomber .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.80	quart jug - & gt ; american pint no date pours a dark clear amber with a big froffy head that left sticky brown lace . robust carbonation present on pour . nose is poor . smells like metal.which worries me . a roasty flavor with a smooth chocolate malt , crossed with a budweiser . start really well and ends really bad . .the initial roasted flavor gives way to a adjunct macro lager finish , which mellows slightly as it warms . the mouth is medium and smooth . this beer looks great and smells bad . the distinctive packaging and the average taste add up to a drinkable beer if you choices are limited and you want to look ultra cool .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	color is a gorgeous amber-red . fluffy , off-white head holds up nicely . smell is faint , like cupcakes baking in the oven as you approach the house ( no , that does n't actually happen in my household ) . taste is complex . definitely getting a bready , caramel malt . not as hoppy as i expected , but the hops are delicious and balance the beer nicely . citrusy finish , but not overpowering . i thought the hops would be more pronounced ; it 's more like an english ale . but it 's still a terrific beer .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60	$ 6,21 kwik liquor north green river rd . evansville , ind . usa says , `` batch # 56 '' this looked and smelled quite nicely , but everything else was rather ho-hum . the colour was a medium leaning toward medium dark cloudy brown with a beautiful head . wonderful head retention , too . this looked really nice in my glass . the smell was nice , as well , consisting of caramel and roasted grains , but no really discernable , specific profile . there was also a musty smell present , as well , that reminded me of a damp basement . i find this with some frequency in many belgian styles . taste was a bit of a dissappointment . it was n't bad , but i felt it lacked alot of depth . it was sweet and had a decent flavour to it , i suppose , but it certainly had no complexity . i found it rather challenging to locate and pin down specific flavour profiles other than simply , `` it 's malty and sweet.. '' . mouthfeel was a bit of a disaster , for the style anyway , as it was very thin and lifeless . this is surprising considering the size of the head , and how long it lasted . overall , i 'm glad i had the chance to review this , but this simply is n't for me . my other one will most likely be used as trade bait .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	a : pours orange and clear . carbonation seems low . the head is very minimal even with an aggressive pour . white head that leaves alright lacing . s : honestly , not too much aroma . the bottle is about two and a half months old so not super fresh . i get a hint of pine and a hint of malt , and not much else . not great , but not bad , so average . t : very floral and quite a bit of pine with a big malt backbone . the malt gives this beer a pleasing fullness and nourishing quality . it definitely tastes better than it smells . pleasing bitterness that is n't ever overbearing , and it sticks on the palate well into the aftertaste . this is a very nice beer to drink . m : on the high side of medium with good carbonation . just about perfect for the style . i was pleasantly surprised by this one . at first the appearance and especially smell were nothing special at all , but it makes up for it with the great taste . another good east coast ipa . would like to try this one fresh .

0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.90	pours a majestic hazy blush-gold with a modest white head that hides on the edges of the glass . not much lacing , but oh well . the initial aroma is grass and hay from the yeast , with a touch of cherry . very clean , and gains strength with time . more of a sweet , honey-cherry-smokey oak flavor with warmth , which puts the first few whiffs to shame . served outside on a warm day , it should be spectacular . i should mention that i 've had but one hoppe and two unearthlys at out of state beer bars and loved them both , so i was ecstatic about seeing four of their selections at the local beer store this week . first sip is verrry complex on the palate , but i 'll take a stab at it : the first thing i get is mustard seed of all things . i 've never tasted anything like it in a beer . mint , oregano , tomato/ketchup , grass , oak trees , a babbling brook , and a partly cloudy sky may also be found here . and some vanilla and cherry . theres a dry bitterness attributable to the magnum hops but not an overwhelming hop flavor . they show up more on the nose . mouthfeel full for a saison yet it sits easily on the palate and has a pleasant spicy kick on the finish . speaking of kick , there 's a pleasant warmth building in my chest and buzzing in my legs as i tackle the final 5 or so sips . with this beer , southern tier has done nothing to remove itself from the top 3-4 of my favorite breweries .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	pours golden yellow with a 1_ finger head that covers the glass with lacing smell is faint pale malts and some earthy hops taste is solid - good amount of pale malts and earthy hop with some slight bitterness mouthfeel is light kinda watery thin - it has a nice creamy finish drinkability is great - a beer with this kind of flavor and only 3.6 % abv - i just wish it was cheaper

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	finally got around to reviewing this . have had it at the brewery and on tap at toronado , but this is my first bottle . a : pours a rich and radiant neon ochre . this shit glows . not much of a head -- which is really the only chink in the elder 's armor , if it 's even that -- with some residual puddles randomly residing across a viscous , nectar surface . spiderweb lacing makes up for the lack of much head . a gorgeous beer . s : and it begins ... the nose explodes with ruby red grapefruit , floral aromas , tropical notes , just loaded with fruity esters . an underlying sweetness ties it all together in one of the most complex and mind-blowing noses i 've ever experienced . perfect . t : and it continues ... wonderfully hop forward , with conspicuous grapefruit character , additional citrus notes ( lemon , lime , oranges ) , loads of pine needles , and an underlying sweetness . not as great as the nose but still excellent . m : prickly hops , of course , some mild warmth from the alcohol , and some light carbonation . nice syrupy body . does n't get much better than this , only different . an epic brew that will never ware on me , ever .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured a bone white 2 '' head which dissipated to nothing . clear sienna yellow/brown in color . smells rich and butterscotchy . taste does n't quite match the smell , more of an ordinary lager with a little hint of caramel . really a very easy drinking ordinary beer which i could have any time in any quantity , and the lady of the house agrees .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.60	341ml brown bottle , 2,59 $ la boucaneuse is a smoked red ale , the boucane is french slang for smoke . a : nice red color as an irsh ale , no head at all . it 's missing something . s. smell like a cheap barbecue . not very expresive . t : the mouth is full of liquid smoke , no body , m : thin beer . not a bad beer but nothing to look forward , missing a bit of caracter .

0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.80	2004 batch drank 7/23/06 dark ruby brown and golden tinged beer pours thickly into my chalice with very little head , just a tan ring of foam . smooth melted creamy chocolate with tart raspberry , kissed with dark fruits ; plums , prunes and blackberries . up front , almost cloying sweetness segues into bitter black/dark chocolate , like 60 % cocoa , with tart raspberry and sour prune . the slightest hint of coffee and roast malt come out in the end . body is the perfect balance of slick & thick ! delicate carbonation makes for an awesome body ! not super quaffable , but extremely complex and tasty . a must have .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	i will start off with the negative , but there is not much to say except ... . the beer had a hint of metallic flavor . not a deal breaker though . read on . appearance is great . nice a clear caramely color . smell is perfect for a high end american amber . taste is great . much like a boont amber ale or insert other sweet amber brand here . great . not much hops , perfection of sweet caramely flavor . i wish it had just a cunny hair of more hops in it ... mf . great . not too fizzy . just great ! overall . great beer . maybe my new `` old faithful '' ?

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	22oz bottle into a sam a. perfect pint a- its an ok dark goldish , with amberish hues near the head , poured a nice thick white 2 finger head s-its almost 50/50 between some citrus and some pine , not strong but its there t-not exactly what i was expecting , it didnt have the same as the nose and a bit astringent in the middle with little to no finish , i wanted much more bitter in the front m-not that lively , really wet through out the whole sip , didnt leave that dry , i want this again and again finish , you almost expect out of dipa 's o/d- overall its ok at best , with a name like hoptimus prime i was expecting an unsung hopslam or ruination , drinkablity its an easy drinker but i doubt ill buy it again

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a chimay chalice . a : poured a 2 finger course white head that collapses quickly and left spotty lacing at best . brew itself was a reddish mahogany . s : smells like a fresh field full of fruit with belgian yeast and sugary malts . there 's a distinct flavor of grape gummies that i pick up . t : starts with subtle sweetness and grapes or red fruit that develops and warms into a thicker version of those same flavors . finishes a bit alcoholic but not overly so . very balanced . finishes sweet and a little tart . m : light to medium bodied and rather carbonated . finishes crisp and even . d : this one is one you want to last . so complex but with such a light body that i could sip it all night , concentrating on discover each and every ingredient .

0.80 0.70 0.90 1.00 1.00	i bought a single bottle of this and brought it home only to find it was just half full . after swapping it back at the store , i brought a full one back to drink and review . appearance : pours a very hazy golden orange color with a small head that dissipates quickly . a small collar and a few patches of lace last until the end . a great deal of suspended sediment is seen floating all throughout the glass . smell : surprisingly not too intense . the nose is full of a sweet floral hop aroma . not much else is detectable . somewhat underwhelming for a double ipa . taste : wow ! the taste , on the other hand , is very intense and complex , yet amazingly not overbearing . it starts out with a nice malt presence , but piny , citrusy , and floral hops quickly begin to dominate . amazing hopiness ! these flavors last through the entire taste and even intensify and become more pronounced until it 's gone . the aftertaste is very clean and leaves no offensive flavors behind . mouthfeel : smooth and goes down easy . medium to light bodied and pretty much spot on . drinkability : exceptional . i should 've gotten a 6 pack , because i 'd definitely have another . and at 9.3 % abv , this beer can definitely be considered `` dangerously drinkable '' . this beer surprised me a lot . i expected a thick , malty , over-the-top beer like i 'm used to with double ipa 's . but instead i got a balanced , flavorful , and easy drinking beer that i 'll be seeking out again . thankfully i have all 12 ounces to enjoy tonight .

0.80 0.30 0.30 0.40 0.30	12 oz bottle pours black and does not let much light in . moderate retention and lacing from a light tan head . nose is surprisingly metallic and mineraly . charred malt is about all else i get ... really not a whole lot going on . disappointing . taste is some black patent malt and tangy minerals . not really very pleasant , to be honest . not sure why , but i was expecting a little more from this new brew . its watery , metallic and lacks any sort of character . i would like to see at least a little sweetness and would a hint of hop character be too much to ask ? im not even going to comment on the 'cold brewed ' nonsense on the label . this beer is a total farce , avoid at all costs . guinness should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for creating this monstrosity .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.90 0.90	purchased as part of `` build-your-own-six-pack '' at local grocer . medium head on a lovely amber body . smell was unremarkable , nothing to mention . however , the honey sweet taste and smoothness were excellent . very easy to drink , with a nice aftertaste . surprisingly good , despite it 's overall grade here . i could drink this all day . well done .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	i was served a 6 ounce sample from a growler filled at the brewery . a : it poured a thin chocolate hue similar to an oolong tea or dr. pepper . it had a nice rich one finger off-white head that produced a fine even lacing . s : plenty of caramel malts , herbal hops and a distinct aroma of alcohol . t : there was an initial burst of sweet malts followed by a zesty hop induced purge of my taste buds . it finished with a clean slightly dry aftertaste that left my mouth ready for the next sip . m : light to medium bodied with a pleasant character and respectful aftertaste . d : oh ya . for an amber ale this one doest the trick . a decent well crafted beer . comment : we sampled four beers from this brewery . two of the growlers had been previously opened , but the amber and porter had remained sealed until the tasting . the amber was a good solid brew that i will eagerly try again .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	appearance : pours a beautiful hazy , honey color with a nice duvel-esque head that sticks around . smell : i ca n't pick up much here . some yeast and maybe hints of vanilla ? taste : nice , big floral/citrus taste up front that fades into some delicious belgian yeast and nice , clean finish with the alcohol making it 's presence known . not too sweet and not too dry . mouthfeel : carbonated , but not too fizzy . light-to-medium bodied brew that has a clean finish . drinkability : for a stronger brew , this one goes down relatively easy . i 'll finish this bottle for sure . a nice , well-balanced offering from ommegang . very similar to duvel , but more complex and fruity . for the price , i 'll buy this again .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.70	this beer pours awfully dark ( into a tulip glass , of course ) . the foamy head settles quickly in an uneven , hilly formation . sticky lacing is apparent all over the top 1/4 of the glass after two minutes . the first sip is heavy with alcohol , but does not bite you with such on the aftertaste . it 's representative of the darker flavors like dates and coffee but carries a delicious tart aroma which reminds me of the common belgian banana scent . drinkability is limited in the first few sips of a glass , but the second two-thirds go down like water . unibroue is a north american anomaly.. exotic enough to be highbrow but local enough to be a source of pride . well done !

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50	i feel like the grinch on this one . this was a very sweet-tasting beer and reminded me of guinness with hershey 's syrup mixed in . great aroma and appearance so i 'll score it high there , but the sweetness was a bit overwhelming on the palate . if you like chocolate or sweets , then you might like this as it offers a range of tastes that run the gamut from bitter to sweet .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	a - bright reddish brown color with a good light brown head . excellent retention and lacing . s - wow . full nose of citrusy hoppy goodness . some grapefruit and some tropical fruit in the nose . a very appatizing aroma . t - a light sweetness up front before a big juicy hop balat comes through . primarily tastes of grapefuit and a little pineapple . the hoppiness lingered for a nice bitter finish . m/d - medium bodied and a nice oily , resinous feel in the mouth . very easy drinking .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.50	on tap served into a shaker pint ... a- orange with a finger of bright white head . very clear . s- a lot of pine and some citrus . quite a malty nose to my dismay . caramel , honey , and biscuit ... not the best aroma for a dipa t/m- definitely interesting . bitterness is all on the front end , right when it his the tongue . again piney , not much fruit or anything else to make this complex . malt is bready and supporting of the bitterness , not overpowering like it was in the nose . medium body with minimal carbonation . o- pretty one dimensional and forgettable . nose was way off and the taste just did n't do a lot for me- average might be generous , but i 'll go with that . i do n't mind a heavier dipa but the dull carbonation made it not refreshing or easy to put down on a hot day ...

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70	pint at the only . a burnished rich orangey color with a finger of creamy head that leaves spider web lacing . nose is devoid of any real hop presence , clean caramel malt , hint of ethanol , perhaps a light floral presence . lots of piney bitterness but lacking much aroma hop presence - not shocking considering the aroma . sticky caramel and bread malt base , resiny pine bitterness with a long finish , alcohol present in the finish . it 's a passable beer but nothing to write home about , despite it being one of the only dipas in ontario . duggan 's skill is more in lower abv beers and this one is a bit of a miss .

0.90 0.40 1.00 0.70 0.60	pours a beautiful ruby wood color with a massive rocky head to rival any trappist ale . thick blankets of lace . the aroma is almost , but not quite , entirely absent . faint cereal and that 's it . even after serious swirling , this beer smells like nothing but cocoa puffs and pale malt . i opened up another beer i 'm familiar with just to make sure there 's nothing wrong with me . biscuits , multigrain bread , bitter chocolate , and hop bitterness on the palette . almost no hop flavor . caramel emerges as it warms , but makes little impact . very simple . while fairly full bodied , this goes down like water . perfect carbonation , i wish all pale ales were this way . this should be what budweiser tastes like . super quaffable and high quality . good wtf-ever beer to go with a simple meal or a movie . but i wish i could try it on cask , maybe then it would have some complexity and real aroma .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	a : beautiful dark reddish brown . formed 3-finger creamy head after pour . left generous amounts of lace on the glass . s : nice sweet smell , but not too complex . t : dark malt , fruit , coffee . balanced flavor . alcohol is well hidden . m : full bodied , creamy , consistent . a bit crisp on the tongue . d : very good . i will order this one again .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	a= clear amber , profuse small bubbling rising , modest head which mostly dissipates quickly leaving a small rim . weak head , not much exciting in the apperance . s= huge spices like a fruitcake , or maybe like a spiced vanilla tea . maybe some apricot in there somewhere . plenty of cinnamon , maybe some ginger , lots of dark fruits . great for sniffing . t= watery , soda-carbonated , and nicely spiced ( we actually like ths spices unlike many previous reviewers , maybe because we were already expecting it thanks to their reviews ) . not very balanced , just too watery , astringent and carbonated to be as enjoyable as even a cup of hot spiced tea . the lovely scents simply do n't follow through in the taste . m= fairly clean ; light sweetness , carbonation bite , astringency . d= fair , not a session beer simply because it only comes in a seasonal variety-pack .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	filled my growler today with this amazing brew . according to paul @ calapooia , it 's basically the riverdog esb , but aged in bourbon barrels that had previously held kringlekrack . from the growler it poured into my pint glass a hazy copper color , with a thick creamy head , good retention , heavy lacing . the aroma is amazing ! sweet bourboney ( sp ? ) aroma , along with just the right amount of hops and a hefty malt sweetness . taste is very true to style , lots of english style hops present . very balanced flavor . mouthfeel is very smooth and buttery . drinkability ? very good . all the flavors and aroma go together so well , and the low abv make this a very sessionable brew . i could drink this all day long .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 1.00	poured into a portsmouth brewery tulip . this is a light caramel colored beer . the pour delivers a quarter inch head that dissolves into lacing after a couple minutes . the smell of this bear makes me eager to drink it . it 's a combination of peach , apricot , and orange . the taste is a pretty well balanced . there is just enough malt sweetness to carry the hops that are pronounced but not too too bitter . this is a nice light ( in color and mouthfeel ) beer that will be great going into spring . this is a very drinkable beverage that is suitable to both beginners to the style and expert connoisseurs .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	bottle courtest of timb . look : reddish brown , transparent clear w/not much head . smell : aged oak , fruity tartness . very fragrant+interesting . taste : a lot going on . tart/sourness , raspberries , oakiness w/aged fruit . finish : oaky then fades to sweet overtones after . crisp , dry tartness . overall : complex w/various aged beers combined . did n't even know this was a sour before i tried it and was pleasantly surprised .

0.70 0.70 0.30 0.20 0.20	i was rather excited to try this beer , since i 'm a fan of the wit style . i found the color a bit perplexing , since it seemed to be a little dark for the style , but the pour ( from a bottle into a glass ) left a nice smooth ( if fleeting ) head , coupled with a nice , spicy aroma . however , once it finally got into my mouth , i very nearly spit it out , because the flavor came on strong and kept coming . the flavors of orange , coriander , and alcohol pretty much beat everything else into submission , which disappointed me , since i think one of the best things about the wit style is the enormous complexity of flavor that you can get . also , the beer seemed to be overly sweet , which detracted from the experience and left it tasting rather sickly once the full flavor presented itself . the finish lasted for a long while , which ordinarily would have been nice , but the sweetness kept it from being truly enjoyable . the mouthfeel was rather oily , which again detracted from the overall experience . overall , i 'd say it would be best to pass on this beer . the packaging is beautiful , but samuel adams needs to go back to the drawing board on this one . with some tweaking , and dialing back some of the flavor elements , particularly the overpowering sweetness , this could probably be a good beer .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90	12 oz bottle a : pours a beautiful perfectly clear red with 1 1/2 '' head that remains enough to cover the top . s : hmm ... a little weaker than i would like . mostly malts , but a little caramel/toffee/sugar . t : sweet malty flavor throughout . somewhat buttery/toffee-ish as well . a touch of hops at the end . very enjoyable , but maybe could have used a bit more hops . m : i 'm never sure how to rate mouthfeel , but i think this is what a 5 is supposed to be . fuller body than sabl , but still smooth as silk . d : very easy to drink . the 6.2 % might sneak up on you after awhile though . the eliot ness holds a special place in my heart . i had been drinking what i thought was 'better ' beer for awhile . ( guinness , sabl , etc . ) but , the first time we went to the store and picked out something totally random we ended up with eliot ness .

0.70 1.00 0.50 0.80 0.70	hazy orange amber with thin fluffy tan head with okay retention and no lacing . huge pumpkin aroma with a bit of spice not unlike pumpkin pie ( which i was eating with it ! ) . spicy bite with big pumpkin flavor and hot bitterness that clears fast . a dry pumpkin finish with a little bit of a salty lingering . i 'm not a big fan of pumpkin but i know a big pumpkin flavor when i taste it . this is spicy despite no use of spices in the brew so presumably it 's from the yeast or hops . my wife loves pumpkin and is not much of a beer drinker and really liked this beer . the only thing i was not too fond of is its dry witbier-like mouthfeel . it is however a fine compliment to pumpkin pie since it is rather dry.the 9 % alcohol is nowhere to be found in the flavor and this is just a great big pumpkin beer .

0.60 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.60	appearance - quite orange with some floaties in it . poured with a decent head which went away rather quickly . smell - getting some grape notes with a little bit of a hop presence in there taste - getting more of the grape with some earthy/oaky notes . a backend of some savory spice and chocolate . mouthfeel - almost like drinking a kids juice or a soft drink . there seems to be something that lingers a bit drinkability - definitely not a beer that everyone will like . i think this is one that you either like or do n't . i rather think it 's an interesting beer but then i tend to like these experimental beers like this that combine unorthodox ingredients .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50	12oz brown bottle with no freshness dating . served in a samuel adams specialty pint glass . pours a dark caramel/deep copper with a rocky off-white head and lively carbonation . head settles in time leaving a creamy looking crown . this is an attractive brew , with a rich color and golden highlights . head left little to no lace . the smell is a mixture of sweet , cookie-like malts , and blackberries , along with other dark fruits ( black grapes and blueberries ) . the hops are spruce-like and hidden in the background . flavor is reminiscent of a sweet red wine at times . there are slightly roasted malts and a canned blackberry taste that finishes kind of sour . mouthfeel is medium bodied with a somewhat dry texture and some fizzy carbonation . i love blackberries , so when i saw this , i knew that i had to give it a try . it started off so promising with an attractive appearance and a nice intriguing smell . that 's where it started going down hill for me . to me the flavors seemed somehow at odds with each other , and the mouthfeel is similar to a flavored soda . i am glad that i gave it a try , but probably would n't want another .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.60	12 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass . thanks jsanford for this ! a- straw colored with a one finger head that dissipates fair quickly . leaves a bit of lacing . s- sweet malt , some grains , and lemon . not a whole lot going on in the aroma . t- sweet malt , grain , mandarine and lemon notes and a bit of green apple . m- light to medium body and carbonation . crisp mouthfeel . a very drinkable session beer . o- a nice beer to have on a hot summer day while grilling , but nothing really stands out with this beer . an average brew .

0.80 0.30 0.30 0.40 0.50	this bottle came from my friend who got it from his dad who got it from someone in vegas . not sure what happened to it before it got to me or if anything happened to it . but what i do know is that this is pretty cheap unimpressive beer . the beer looked cool and had some interesting artwork . i 'm not much of an old star trek fan so i ca n't comment on the label too much . the bright blue color of the beer was interesting but i am assuming that its just food coloring . upon opening the bottle i was greeted a moderatly strong skunk aroma and thats about it . the taste was n't too bad but there was very little flavor at all . i got half way through the bottle before i could taste anything at all . the taste was kinda sweet and very thin and fizzy . it had more of a soda texture to it . the upside is that since it did n't taste like anything , it was drinkable . the short version is that it looks cool , smells nasty , tastes like nothing , and is chuggable .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	the aroma is particularly good on this stout ; there is a lot of fresh blueberry aroma , along with nutty , chocolaty , and yeasty aromas to compliment . the beer pours with a very deep black color and a head that stays around the rim of the glass leaving a swirl on top of the beer . from the smell i expected this to be very fruity , which in it 's own right it is , however not in an alcipop sort of way . the initial flavors are of a very strong and bitter stout . flavors that hit the tongue right off the bat are a little overwhelming but very nice to pick through . the blueberry introduces the beer at the tip of the tongue while strong flavors of wood and dark roasted coffee take over . the back of the tongue gets a deep almost burnt malt flavor which dances well with the hop bitterness . the flavors are so intense that it reminds me of an imperial stout ! the palate is almost bizarre as the beer slides across your tongue but is somewhat harsh going down . overall this is absolutley worth a try ( or even a case )

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60	hair of the dog adam slightly chilled , served in a wine glass minimal carbonation and no head , just a few large bubbles . color is an almost black brown with red highlights , and the oily lacing reminds me of a viscous wine or whisky . smell is dominant dark fruit ( plum and fig ) with just hints of chocolate cake , cherries , and that leather smell . very complex . there is a dark smooth malt character and some caramel as well . i could smell this all day . taste is the nose , followed by a whiff of smoke and finishing like a rich deep red wine . my brother commented that he picked up on dr. pepper like qualities . caramel malt . mouthfeel was oily and clingy . drinkability : i know it 's a great beer but for me drinkability was just ok . i think the sweetness and complexity will mellow this beer out in a year .

0.40 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.90	came in a 22 oz . bomber with wax on top ; served in a pint glass . pours a deep amber with reddish hues with a half-finger head that dies quickly . leaves very little lacing . smells sweet and sugary , yet dark -- raisins , butter , and plums . tastes really buttery and sweet , but also somewhat dark . an average mouthfeel , a little thin . this stuff smells great . a very unique sweet plummy/buttery smell . tastes good , too . does n't taste like 9 % at all . not impressed with the appearance though . all in all , a very good try on a belgian style by anderson valley . i want to try their tripel now .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.70	appearance : took a seriously fast pour to raise any sort of head on this dark brown brew . the head is perhaps half a finger thick , but it 's a porter so i 'm not taking points off . aroma : coffee and , unfortunately , cigarettes . not smoke but ashtray nastiness . taste : fortunately the taste covers the smell . more mellow than one would expect . cocoa , burnt oats , and a woody aftertaste . dense and complex . mouthfeel : thin and more watery than you would expect , but smooth enough . drinkability : dark beer lovers will appreciate . not an everyday beer , but an interesting seasonal .

0.40 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	one of the bottles i picked up from the release party . poured into a snifter and split two ways . the pour yields a pond-water flat liquid that is viscous , thick , garnet-brown in color . a swirl produces a slick oily film on the walls of the glass . there does n't seem to be much residual sugar left in this , as there are no legs . the aroma is deep and complex . it has sherry-like qualities ; no surprise that it is slightly oxidized given the 4 years that it spent in oak barrels that are not impervious to oxygen . luckily , this is n't the cardboard oxidation , so it actually goes well , as i will describe . the nose is mainly raisins and dates up front , which then give way to tart cherries , toffee , caramel , and light bourbon/vanilla notes . the flavor is similarly well-balanced , and it adds a touch of bretty funk to the overall profile . like ray daniels suggests , this old ale has some bretty notes that harken back to the old ales originally brewed in england over 100 years ago . a fitting accompaniment to weyerbacher 's english-style barleywine base . the components of the aroma that i had mentioned are all evident here , and they are also joined by some leathery notes ( a la hotd adam , though not as intense ) that really deepen the complexity of this aged brew . at 12 % abv , you would never know until it starts to hit you . not hot , not warm , not nothing . this is extremely mellow and smooth . thick and viscous , but not nearly carbonated enough , even for a barleywine . even with the brett , this still has plenty of body to it . since they got 1 of 2 criteria , i figure this is pretty average . there is a little bit of dissolved co2 that gives it a little less of a one-note texture , but not enough at all . overall , this is a very interesting and compelling beer . not what i was expecting , that 's for sure , but looking at things historically as well as flavor-wise , this beer is certainly a winner . i love the mellow notes of barrels that meld so well with the base beer . the bretty wildness is a welcome addition , as it is done tastefully enough to just augment the overall experience .

0.60 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.20	i really like bells beer , this was the first time that i ever did not like one , i looked a little flat when i poured it , and the taste was bad , cherry and dark beers should go well together , and this one did not . i know i will never drink this one again .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.40	drank from a 12 fl . oz . bottle purchased at julio 's liquors , westboro , ma first , i must say that the leather clad , beer drinking bimbo on the bottle 's label is rather ridiculous . every beer nerd 's fantasy , i guess . as for the beer itself : after decanting , it poured a clear , copper-amber with no real head but rather a thin , white , fizzy film of lace . aroma was intensely hoppy yet smooth and balanced . piney and floral hops , citrus and fruity esters came through strong along with a touch of candy-like sweetness . the taste was super hoppy as well yet completely unbalanced . the hops assaulted my palate from the very beginning and never let up . cascade hops and hop oils soon became bitter and biting and left a noticeable film on my tongue . intense pine sap , grapefruit and orange rind carried into the super dry , bitter , long-lasting finish . as i continued to drink the beer , the finish seem to become somewhat sour , in a lemony sort of way . mouthfeel was quite thin , watery and a bit fizzy . unquestionably , this was the most bitter and unbalanced ipa i have had to date . a true hop bomb in every sense of the word . i found it astonishing that it registers at only 50 i.b.u.s . while many may applaud this beer 's extreme nature , i found that its total lack of balance made it rather difficult to drink .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	pours a hazy orangish/yellow with a decent white head that fades about as fast as the fizz on a soda . smell is mighty fruity with loads of banana and some vanilla . the taste starts off with some nice banana flavors before going to some light wheatish tastes and then heading out on a slightly sour note . the sourness is definitely out of place and takes off some points . the brew was a little thin for a hefe , did n't have the typical full mouthfeel , but it was still fairly drinkable . this bottle may have been slightly off so i may have to re-review this if i can find some fresher samples .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.70	12oz can poured into a pint glass . pours a very clear and slightly hazy yellow with a small thin white head . nose is fairly lager-like with some light frutiness . taste is quite good , has a light hoppiness to with a decent malt backbone . it 's pretty light and crisp , easy to drink . better than their traditional lager or black & tan

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.90	so me and sheepnutz are out at the hofbrauhaus newport swilling down weizens , see . well we ended the evening a little earlier than i usually would due to my wife 's friends with a short leash or something , what the hell ever , right ? so we said our sayonaras and perhaps sheep and i will check out beer and pretzel night at barrel house later in june , do a beer night proper justice . but now it 's me and my other half , with a sitter at home and some free time on our hands . we check out a local bar with live music ( the polecats ) and i 'm looking for something i have n't reviewed . they do n't even have taps here at patrick 's in delhi , just bottles , my military background tells me we will make due . quite the long setup , i know , but sometimes ambience has an impact for a review . i look into the cold case , and the only thing i can even *consider* drinking after hofbrau will be either guinness or newcastle brown . obviously , the guinness won . i asked the barmaid for a glass , did i get a pint glass ? course not , she gave this comic book pilsener glass that might hold 6 ounces or something . what 's that about ? again , we 'll make due . the beer pours out quite dark and the liquid texture is on the thick side . perhaps you 're thinking this is a heavy-tasting beer . aroma , however , may make you reconsider . i pick up some faint roasted malt , but not as much as the dark color would implicate . the head appears after the beer is poured , in a bottom-up fashion . maybe one finger or so , and kept a layer across the top all the way to the bottom . wonderful lacing down the side , i used the empty glass as an example to show my wife what 'lacing ' meant . she was dutifully thrilled if nothing else . a fine woman , my wife , but that 's another review ... the taste , while in my book underachieves the first impression left by the darkness and head , is a stalwart in this particular beer style . it is a benchmark of sorts , and also an entry point for many who want to try dark beers - save the expedition for another day . noticeable roasted grain taste , heavier than normal mouthfeel , but not overwhelming in flavor , bite , alcohol . the nitro effect certainly softens up the mouthfeel as you would expect , i would like to try this in another format beside nitro bottle . just a slight hop feel at the end , keeping in step with the malt level . taste-wise , it 's not over the top , but it *is* most tasty and a very drinkable beer .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50	massively bubbled haystack gold beneath a four finger cap of bone colored froth that is only as small as it is because of an exceedingly gentle pour . it would n't be an exaggeration to describe the carbonation as champagne-like . the foam looks better than expected as it melts , leaving no more than a few tendrils of watery lace in its wake . the nose does n't appear to have been affected by whatever caused the crazy amount of bubbles . the beer smells like fresh , ripe raspberries rather than berry extract , which is pretty much all i ask of a fruit beer . it 's no surprise that the pale wheat base beer does n't contribute a thing . it 's too bad that i got a less than perfect bottle because southern tier is one of my favorite breweries and my taste buds were all set for something well above average . unfortuntely , raspberry wheat ale falls short of an average score for several reasons , not the least of which is an incredible amount of mouthfeel chaos . subtracting out the bubbles , though , still leaves me with a beer that is way too bitter . rwa tastes like tonic water , to which was added a splash of raspberry juice and a few shots of angostura bitters . time , which allows the carbonation to dissipate to some extent , helps . a little . very little . what is there to say about a mouthfeel that 's more fizzy that soda pop ? obviously , something went wrong between brewing and crown cracking . i was going to try to guess what it might be like without all the co2 , but it 's next to impossible to do so . raspberry wheat ale is a disappointment . this is one of those beers that deserves a second chance in the hopes that i stumbled upon a bottle from an aberrant batch . i have too much respect for southern tier to judge their fruit beer bona fides on one bad experience .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	a- decent colored brown with an off white small head . s- light sweet malt and some mild chocolate . pretty mild overall . t- mmm . light sweet caramel is followed up with earthy and roasty flavors followed by a bit of fruit and bitterness . a really good beer all the way through . m- a moderate body and moderate carbonation balance well . really on target with the flavor . d- this is a really good , moderately roasty brown that i would love to have a few more of .

0.70 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90	poured in a pint glass , the alaskan winter ale is a bright , clear copper with a large , light tan head that quickly subsided to a very slight collar , and left minimal lace . the aroma is bright , maybe too sweet , piney , fruity and a noticeable amount of alcohol . as mentioned on the bottle , that dominant aroma is spruce tips . the taste is a bit cloying but nice , more of a fruity bubblegum with a firm malt backbone and bitter hop finish , then the dominate spruce in the aroma - but make no mistake , it is certainly there ... i just think it is really nicely balanced , much more then the aroma would leave you to believe . my taste runs towards sweeter , extreme tasting to beers , so consider that when i say that i really enjoyed the taste of this one . only complaint would be the the aftertaste looses the balance and can be a bit sprucy , but it creeps on you slowly . the mouthfeel was perfect , and it was one the most drinkable winter ales i 've , at least from this country . i never had more then 2 of these in one sitting , but i 'd guess they 'd session quite nicely .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.90	appearance : nice crystal clear burnt orange color , big white head , fades pretty . the remains are creamy and off-white . smell : funky grain , slightly sour and lactic . diacetyl , maybe ? taste : deep roasted malt , a little chocolatey . hops are fairly mild , more of a malty red ale . still , balanced and much better than the smell alludes to . drinkability : enjoyable and non-offensive . i do think there are better local beers that i would get for the $ $ $ .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.50	caged and corked , 750ml with a seriously scuffed up label and slightly blacked cork . the tag notes it was aged at 52 degrees from march sept 2004 . on top of that the bottle actually smells like the inside of a cave . this beer poured a thick tan head over a ruby/brown body . the nose was a mix of phenols , chocolate , dates , sugar , ripe fruit and spice . a slight cork and cave smell is present , although very faint . this is one of those noses you could just sit and smell all day without taking a single sip . beautiful . the taste was slightly woody and corky . very dry and a tad bit tannic . a huge carbonation balances against the medium to full body . dark chocolate , plums , dates , raisins , malt with a very dark chocolate like bitterness . theres a subtle cardboard and non-spicy black pepper taste . a very hoppy , leafy , roughage sort of hop flavor . the one interesting note in this beer is the cave flavor . you can seriously taste this granite , rock , dry cave flavor in all the sips . on the rocks takes on a whole new meaning . it ends with a long lingering dry rock taste . im not sure if its just the cave aging or what , but i wouldnt be able to tell this is ommegang if you gave me a blind taste test . the aging makes this a completely different beer . the rock taste really overpowers the belgian dark ale taste . i found this a tough beer to swallow , although to give it credit , it is one of the most interesting beers ive had in a long time .

0.60 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.80	i was there with a friend to sample the first keg of this they had on . pouring the pint 10 feet away , i could smell the hazelnut/vanilla aroma . since then , then nose has n't been quite as intense , so maybe the recipe was altered a bit . a decent , smooth easy-drinking beer that does n't take too many risks . i agree with another poster who said the beer could use a bit more carbonation , but that 's an easy fix . could be mistaken for cream soda , if you 're drunk enough ( it 's very easy to do at this place ! )

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	batch 10 poured into a tulip , the color of coca cola with a thin tan head . beautiful aromas of freshly baked banana bread , vanilla coke , toasted candied coconut . very in your face and complex on the nose with maybe a touch of sweet tea too . roasted malts in the mouth with nice carbonation and a hoppy bitterness and a touch of spice - the initial nosing is really the star here . definitely will be cracking some more of these open in the future , alcohol is well hidden and i tend to consider rr a bit too hyped but this is a very nice beer .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.50	500ml . mindestens haltbar bis : 04.09.11 . a `` festbier '' by name , it really looks like a crystal-clear helles with a bright , foamy white head that leaves some nice lacing . i really like the hop presence in the nose , it was unexpected . it is spicy with some lemon rind . the flavor is a reverse . it is super malty and sweet . there is a smidgen of hop flavor but it is mostly sugary malt . meh , after tasting it is okay .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	purchased and opened days after arriving at my local beer purveyor . against st 's recommendation , i poured this one into a 20 oz. , 562 queen 's seal imperial pint glass . clear copper color and a stable 3/4 finger head that remains consistent . aroma smacks you . good and hard . hops and oak would be an obvious statement . my notes indicate an amazing floral and woody perfume aroma . initial flavor is upfront pine and sweetness . picking up some nutty and almost coconut flavor in the first couple of sips . halfway through the aroma is still delivering . silky mouthfeel and some sweetness which i would attribute to vigorous hopping .

0.90 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.60	served in a fobab taster pint . bottled january 2011 , no listed abv . a - pours with a voluminous three fingers of mocha foam that settle to a thick cap , and big swathes of lace . body is an opaque , very dark brown . s - smell is strangely mineral and lightly metallic , in an unpleasant espresso sort of way . if i look past that there is some oak and semisweet chocolate . there is also some grain character apparent . t -taste is burnt malt bitterness , some astringency , dry oak , anise , and some dark chocolate that comes out as it warms up . not much sweetness . m - very carbonated . medium-light body , roasty and gritty , dry and tannic finish . not much residual stickiness . supremely chuggable , with no alcohol present at all . 8.6 % ? really ? d - was this infected with brett ? it 's very dry and low in sugars and it 's definitely overcarbonated . there are some off flavors in the nose too . the light texture makes this easy to drink even though it 's far from the best barrel-aged stout i 've had .

0.80 0.20 0.90 0.60 0.40	my father got his hands on 2 bottles of this and was nice enough to share . this is definatley one that i 'm glad i did n't pay for but i 'm glad i tried it . this was probably a very impressive beer in it 's time but now drinking it flat and well past it 's prime is almost cruel and unusual punishment . at first sniff after opening was molasses and soy sauce a awful combination . pour was very thick and black and flat . at first tasts almost sweet then just gets worse . after taste is like the smell . bad . but it does come in a very nice blue glass bottle that i will keep .

0.60 0.20 0.50 0.40 0.40	from my notes 6/12/07 pours a one-finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace . crystal clear amber color . skunky nose . light-medium carbonation and light bodied . flavor is mildly hoppy , not much going on , could be a good lawn mower beer . on-tap at the hotel jolly midas rome , italy , 0.4l glass for 5.50 ( $ 7.54 ) .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	i remember trying the original uk version 10+ years ago and the shipyard brewed rendition is eerily similar ( probably the proprietery yeast ) . classic esb , genuine bitter hoppiness instead of yet another ubiquitous , pinesol flavored ale . i especially love the saline/mineral undercurrent from start to finish . bravo !

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured into a pint glass . a : pours a orange-copper with great clarity . off-white head is creamy and lingers a bit leaving great lacing . s : not very apparent - some faint sweet , malty notes . t : very sweet malt up front , with a very mild hop finish . m : medium body with moderate carbonation . `` feels '' sweet with a clean finish . d : very drinkable - could be a session beer for some - may be a little too sweet or a little `` rich '' for some to be a session ; definitely worth checking out .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	( served in an american pint glass ) a- this beer has a warm mahogany brown body with a hint of red tint to it . the light tan head is thick and last and last with a gentle carbonation of tiny bubbles rising through the clear but dense liquid . s- the slightly sweet toasted malt smell has an almost spice quality to it with some fresh juicy green hops in the finish . t- the smooth malty flavor has a nice dry toasted malt complexity with some soft biscuit note to it . there is a green slightly citrus hop finish that gets a nice boost with some slight carbonic bite . m- this beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with a nice fizz texture in the finish . no alcohol warmth or astringency . d- this beer has good complexity with a unique toasted malt flavor that really balances nicely with the green fresh hops . the fizz in the mouthfeel really compliments the hops to give them that extra kick .

0.80 0.70 1.00 1.00 1.00	a - black . one finger of dense tan head followed by rings of lacing . s - roasted malt , chocolate , coffee and cream . t - yes ! mild , sweet milk chocolate comes out in the roasted oat malts . has a bitterness which balances with the sweetness perfectly . there 's some sweet soft carrot in there too . the chocolate lingers . delicious . m - smooth , buttery , creamy yet not too heavy . low carbonation . very sessionable . o - a beautiful , robust , sweet stout . would be my recommendation for someone wanting to try their first stout .

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	a magnum purchased by brother ( thanks george ) and shared over an afternoon ( from notes ) . poured a beautiful dark amber color with an orange hue into a glass . foam head was clean and slightly orange hue . smell was delicious . nutmeg , cinnamon , holiday cheer ... everything a holiday ale should smell like . taste was just like scent . nutmeg and cinnamon with a fruity finish . hops were masked and hardly there . feel was a slightly weak - carbonation was slightly thin . the finish was dry . overall this beer was good . i would definitely try the 2012 redition .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	grain belt premium was the first beer i every drank -- many years ago . the label has moved to a different brewery since then and i have moved on to other beers as well . as nostalgia goes , you ca n't beat this one for me . these days , though , the flavor does n't live up to my memory . the clear bottle presents a yellow clear brew with a white cap of foam . after pouring the beer into a shaker pint , the foam had excellent retention . the aroma is soft with sweet corn and pale malts . more sweet corn on the palate , fairly sweet . some malt , but mostly juicy corn . as the beer moves back a hint of metallic before it vanishes with a whimper of bitterness . the corn puts the adjunct into this american adjunct lager , and they brewers are not being shy about it . in the end , a drinkable version of the style -- better than many others i have had in this category .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured out of 12 oz bottle into pint glass . a ) a clear and bright yellow color . there was an inch of white head , not much retention , no lacing . s ) sad to report , but this is mostly skunk . t ) this was not as bad as the nose . there was some skunk unfortunately , but it was at least somewhat counter acted by grains , hints of hops and a slightly grassy dry finish . m ) pretty light bodied , with a decent amount of carbonation . there is some fizz to this one . o ) perhaps this is the curse of the green bottle . i ca n't recall a time i 've had a pauli girl that was n't a bit skunky . this beer is n't terrible . ice cold out of the cooler , you could do worse .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.60	brown head that seems to settle down quickly . sounds very carbonated with the bubbles sizzling . a dark body but is n't totally opaque . hints of ruby redness intertwined in the darkness . decent lacing on the glass . what a nice smell ! sweet roasted smells of toffee , coffee , caramel , roasted malts , oats and chocalate . fluffy body , feels like whip cream , a slight tingliness from carbonation . it seems to dry the mouth out quite a bit . the taste explosion of roasted malts are very blunt at first . chocolate up front with maybe a hint of cherry ? toffee in the middle , hops and barley in the aftertaste . there is something so delicious about this stout but yet i do feel like something is lacking . drink ability is there if it was n't too filling . i want more but the tummy is telling me wait a little bit . i originally tried this on tap and i loved it ! if i did the review right then and there , the taste would have gotten a perfect score . since i 'm reviewing it in a bottle , the taste is slightly off , the score suffered slightly and i believe that 's why i feel it 's lacking .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	deep brown with a two finger head and a good lacing on the glass . there is no good color to describe the hues that shine through the glass . smell is caramel malts and a subtle lager yeast , really hope it does n't taste like it smells . taste is rich and complex , vine fruits plum and dark cherry are very noticable with a great malt whop ! sweet and sugary in the finish and leaves me wanting more and more ! mouth is slightly oily but carbonated just right . this beer drinks way too easy for words and could be dangerous in six pack form .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	at home with a picnic tap . a : a nice pumpkin orange with a frothy white head . s : malty , bready , yeasty and a bit hoppy . t : caramel sweet malt with toffee flavors , great malt/hop balance . a tad more hoppy than traditional oktoberfests . bready and toasty . mf : nice and creamy . medium body . d : i could drink this all night . and i will .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	- this beer had a very exceptional appearance and a weathered pumpkin smell . very inviting beer , although there was something `` left on the field '' as the beer entered my mouth . not my favorite , but this would be an occasional choice to break things up .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	12 ounce brown bottle poured into a pint glass appearance : dark brown with a good amount of tan head leaving a little lacing . smell : there is a roasted smell but it seems a little off from what i would expect . taste : there is a slight roasted bitterness but not much . it is fairly sweet with an almost nutty flavor . i pick up a little on the smokiness but it is not too pronounced .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.90	buddy pete picked me up a growler of their red , and a 6-pack of this porter ... lover their stuff ! - pours a nice coffee black ... clear as best as i can see it at the edges of my pint glass ... nice off white to mocha head.. about half a finger down to a slight slew and a ring.. - rich chocolate malt profile ... slightly sweet , roasted and a touch of coffee ... . loving the smell ... sweet oats , grain . - wonderful zingy porter ... nice bitter earthy hop.. and a backdrop of sweet oats and chocolate malt ... a very pleasant and drinkable porter . - only slightly chalky , thin to medium bodied.. slight creaminess to it ... . - super good porter ... i rather like its simplicity and flavor combination ... very balanced .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	a very average beer . it claims to be a pilsner but lacks the required bitterness for it . golden to amber in color it pours a white head that litteraly dissolves in seconds . hardly any smell , a little bit of malt maybe . the taste is rather disappointing . sweet malt flavour dominate the palate . not enough bitterness to balance it nicely and hardly any hop characteristics . i can taste some sourness . this beer is not worth your money ! it is very mediocre and can not emphasize anything that will make it stand out .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.60	a - clear red orange body with two finger for frothy tan head and excellent lacing s - a little pine and a little citrus . i would n't call this a ipa smell and is kind of faint t - nice mix of flavor and bitter hops with a little spice and citrus in the back m - medium body with medium carbonation d - easy to drink and kind of enjoyable but nothing really special

0.50 0.50 0.90 0.80 0.90	the color is nice , but i 'm still having problems getting a good head on these beers . the aroma is good , with a slight hint of sourness to it , but other than that rather like rising bread dough . the flavor is actually quite nice , lots of grains and malt , that leads way to spices and other fall flavors in the finish . the mouth feel is smooth and creamy with just enough viscosity to stick to your palate and let your senses enjoy all the lingering sensations of it . i also think this is an incredibly drinkable beer .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.60	a - a clear pale shade of apricot under a quick wispy finger of head . s - musty leather , peaches . t - sweet caramelised peaches . no trace of the 2.5 % alcohol . not much sourness . refreshing . m - thin , yet has a syrupy quality . high carbonation . o - the lack of sourness is probably not a good thing for a lambic , but the sweet peach flavour is agreeable . nice , summery thirst quencher .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70	i must admit before you read my review , that to my knowledge , i have never tasted saffron in any way shape or form . so there are scents and flavors that do n't register with me in thgis particular brew . making it that more mysterious and interesting . appearance- poured a honey yet slightly amber hue with a spritzy two-finger head . the head has very little retention but leaves a minor foam with a dash of lacing . smell- the first wiff that enters my noise is a vinous blend of grapes and honey . the other smells that i detected are of a general malty nature , nothing i can put my finger on . no hops present in the aroma . taste- he start is a gneral sour that turns into some vary viney malts easily defined as grapes . the sugary flavor seems to be honey based and helps take awy from the sour grape flavor . this all combines to end wityh a combo of sweet and sour , but more sour than sweet . mouthfeel- an acidic palate really cuts through whatever residual flavors left on my tongue left by previous food or drinks . overall its about a 70 % sour and 30 % sweet . overall a very diffeent beer . what i had seen on the history channel was that this recipe was taken from scriptures unearthed from a tomb believed to be king midas 's . so no hops . but something to seek out for the adventurous beer afiucionado .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	i read about the beer and knew i would eventually have to try it . i did not realize they only had 3 vintage releases of the beer ( the latest being 97 ) . i was 8 years old when this beer was released and the only thing i thought maple syrup was for pouring over pancakes . when i was checking out i was asked whether i 'd ever had the beer before . i said , `` no , tonight 's the night , '' to which the cashier replied , `` it 's not one of my favorites , man is it thick ... '' upon returning home , i peeled off the wrapping and proceeded to break the cork in half . i knew more trouble was only to come when the cork fell down into the blackness . appearance : this beer looks rich , completely dark with tremendous amounts of sediment . there is paper-like and fine particle sediment in the bottom and sides of the container 's inside , some of which transferred into my glass ( even with a slow pour ) . the beer has an oily halo that is of incredible richness . this fine layer left on the inside of my glass produces a rusty-yellow glow when held to the light . i have never seen anything like this beer . smell : holy intensity . four out of four people that smelled this beer wanted nothing to do with it . i get strong notes of soy sauce , oak , and ethanol . i can not find much of the maple syrup sweetness that i was expecting . honestly , i 'm beginning to doubt my purchase and wonder whether i can even move on to the next step . taste : the taste is incredibly potent . i would n't call this a bock at this point , i would call it a canvas for maximum yeast fermentation . there is a sweetness that you can taste , but there is so much going on that it 's hard to write down any one flavor . i am glad i at least had the balls to try it room temp , but it would be so much easier to drink cooler . the beer is not for the weak , nor for the blind . know what you are getting into and read reviews before purchasing . most of these bottles have sat for almost 15 years . mouthfeel : the beer is very thick and an effort to put down . i honestly do not know why this beer is such a struggle , i have had dfh beers that are the upwards of 15 % abv and drank them with ease . this beer , however , is a different story . i get a cough syrup-like repulsion that makes me cough every time i take a sip . i can see why whiskey barrel aging would add a certain layer of complexity to other beers , but this beer already had a tremendous amount going on and may not have benefited from this type of conditioning . in summary , the beer is trying too hard to be a liquor when it just does n't have the cojones . drinkability : i think r. kelly summarizes this `` beer '' perfectly with , `` my mind 's tellin ' me noooo ... but my body , my body is tellin ' me yeeaaahhhaa . '' for some reason i just kept at it and gladly shared with all who came back for more . i may see how this goes down with a little temperature modulation , but a food pairing is out of the question . much like harry and dumbledore at the lake of the inferi , we were left force-feeding each other this horcrux poison . i respect beer and all those that try and expand common conceptions , but this one does n't bring home the goods . cheers .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	opaque black color with a small , fizzy tan head with good retention . maybe it was just the bottle i got , but i could barely pick up an aroma off this beer . very faint roasted malts . after being unsatisfied with the aroma , the taste came and saved the day , bringing the malts to the foreground . the flavor of chocolate and roasted barley malts coat the inside of your mouth and it all ends with a slight hop bitterness in the finish . drinkable for a stout , but not my favorite so far . i would like to try it out of a nitro can , however , as i can see it 's potential for being a different beast out of the can .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	michelob light was an above average light beer . it went down very smooth and i enjoyed it . however i was expecting more taste , the bottle says brewed with imported hops but to tell you the truth this beer tasted very similar to the less pricey michelob golden draft light sold here in minnesota . it was very easy to down the 12 pack i bought . if you are ever in minnesota or its border states save some money and buy mich gold light

0.40 0.30 0.50 0.60 0.50	pours a dark yellow/amber colour with a thick head that leaves very quickly . next to no carbonation , no lacing ... after a minute it looks stagnent . woah , very different nose of hard green leafy hops and a touch of stink ( or should that be skunk ? ) . has got traces of sweat , grass and some slight grains . not impressed . palate is a touch better , with the same leafy flavours and a touch of astringency on the sides of the tounge . very flat palate with some sweetness to it . this was a seriously strange smelling beer , not containing any real enjoyable aromas . rather displeased..

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	330ml bottle purchased from warners at the bay and poured into a mikkeller goblet . pours a copper & mahogany colour with a slightly off-white head of foam that turns to film after a couple of minutes . aroma starts with a tropical fruit note , some fruit salad and then turns into pine . taste is notable , quite bitter hop resin comes throgh . not a lot else sadly . seems to do what it sets out to do with mouthfeel , bitter middle and finish . overall , an ipa that is n't really pale , let alone orangey in colour . smell is the best part , downhill from there . a tad one-dimensional with the flavour .

0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40 0.30	what can i say , its russian . it does n't smell of formaldehyde ... which is a good thing . bought a bottle at a going out of business sale ... this beer was nasty and probably old ... but i tried it and was not impressed . faint flavor like the polish beer zywiec but weaker..

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	this brew pours a pale , cloudy straw color with a thin white head . it has a really nice , spicy aroma with a solid grain backbone . as you 'd expect from sn the spicy , bitter hops are front and center in this brew , though less so than many of their offerings . behind the hops it has a remarkably clean taste profile , no fruty esters to speak of as you 'd find in german hefe 's . i find this beer to be very food friendly and i try to keep it as a summertime staple . another solid brew from sierra nevada .

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.30	this beer is so hyped up that it drives me nuts ! i had this beer on tap with some cinnamon shit on the rim and that was the only good thing about it ! the taste was absolutley awful ! it has a super bitterness to it and maybe im bias , but im just not an ale fan ... .ill stick to lagers !

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.90	pours a clear , golden colour with a tremendous 2 '' head with ridiculously chunky lacing . small malt aroma . lighter smelling than i remembered . actually moderately hoppy . my only wish is that the aroma was a bit stronger . fabulously smooth taste with a touch of sweet malt . reminds me alot of zwickls . a bit thin , but very smooth . most brews in this style are overcarbonated , but this one gets it right . insanely drinkable . i am thoroughly enjoying drinking this one in a huge biergarten in austria . this beauty blows its american counterpart out of the water .

0.70 0.80 0.70 0.50 0.50	traded a ba buddy of mine for this bottle when i stopped in for a visit on holiday . thanks for the opportunity ! pours a two finger off-white fluffy head over a very cloudy dull lemon colored liquid . smells rich sweet malt , c aramel and some bock . some hops ... rough and mild ... so they come across to me a tettnanger . a dab of honey aroma as i drink the beer . tatses dry with a hint of funk . that 's munich malts speaking to me . a little bit of dirty tettnanger hops ties into the malt . what i find disturbing is an intrusive clove flavor that does n't belong . i wonder if this one is starting to skunk . i once had a bottle of hofbrau that was like this ... it was a shadow of the fresh stuff i drank in munich . light in the mouth , but ahs a thick sugary feel . too bad about the clove , this beer was going to rate quite well .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.60	pours an off-yellow with a lacy two-finger head . smells like musty , almost dank lemons . most definitely a better visual than smell . tastes biscuity , with a bit of lemon `` zest '' in the finish . the body seems pretty watery , there really is n't a while lot behind it . solid mouthfeel , the cloying aftertaste is the best part of the beer for me , if you can get past the initial smell-taste . it 's crisp and well-carbonated , making it an easy drink . i just do n't know if i would want to have another one .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.50	appearance- poured a golden copper color with a decent carbonation and quickly dissipating white foam head smell- sweet malts and green apples were the first things to hit me off the nose , sugar sweet , lots of apples maybe caramel dipped ones even , appealing smell taste- a mix of sweet with slight twinge of bitter at the end . very sweet over powering malty double bock . sweet and syrupy mouthfeel- thick syrupy and sugary , no lightweight soft bodied beer here drinkability- this has to be a night cap and a beer you only have one of just way to over powering and though high alcohol is hidden a bit just thick and syrupy for more then a nite cap . an okay beer but not one that leaves you wanting another

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	my 100th review . figured it to be a small victory . so ... st.victorious here i come . heard/read a lot of hype behing this beer . 12 oz fresh bottle poured into pint glass . a : nice clear dark brown , with a reddish hue . little head recedes into nothingness instantly . no lacing , no retention ... nothing . s : virtually nothing . very little sweet malt . very unimpressive . t : sweet and cloying . somewhat boozy and astringent . not nearly as good as expected . not really complex . m : full bodied , syrupy , but no carbonation . d : drinkable , but i really do n't want to . not one of the better doppels , imo . i was really let down by this one . normally , i like victory beers better than this .

0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	had this before , of course , but never *rated* it . read a lot of other reviews , kinda surprised by my appraisal of it : perfect amber orange pour , head and lacing somewhat poor ( old beer ? ) . many people wrote of the hop intensity , but i didnt notice that much my notes say a lite hop tang with nice dry aftertaste . lite & spicy thoughout . very good overall taste will have to find it on tap and have another glass ( or two ) .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.70	my girlfriend bought a six-pack of this since we both like north coast pranqster so much . it appears black in the tall mug that i poured it into , held against the light it is a very rich dark brown . this beer pours thick with a very thin mocha colored head that fades quickly leaving a fairy ring with some lacing as i drink it . the aroma is of dark chocolate and malty with a hint of coffee lurking in the shadows . it tastes full of roasted chocolate and caramel . the complexity of the flavor is really good but it comes off lacking something . i cant put my finger on it really . it seems a bit thin in the mouthfeel and that may be it . it has the potential flavor but the body just doesnt back it up . i can definitely drink more of this but it always makes me want to tweak with the recipe in my head , trying to make it better .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	pours a nice amber nectar with minimum heads but lots of lace . aroma is tremendous citrus , grape fruity , resiny hop smell . taste is light malt and powerful , grity bitterness . hops used are warrior , tomahawk and cascade . the real hopheads would truly enjoy this beer , those looking for a little balance wo n't really find it . not quite in the league of an imperial ipa but 75 ibu 's is up there and really hides the relatively high abv . just a hint of grittiness in the mouth takes a few marks off the mouthfeel and drinkability .

0.40 0.80 0.30 0.40 0.50	swing-top bottle into a 10oz nonik glass . fairly vigorous pour yielded not much in terms of head . smell is pleasantly malty and sweet . color is a hazed amber gold . taste is subtle/borderline bland and follows the aroma . mouthfeel is pretty thin and carbonation pretty low . not much going on hop-wise . definitely a strange aftertaste but not as extreme as some reviewers indicate . overall , below average and not really worth you time or money . wo n't kill you though ...

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	drank this at room temperature , maybe 68 . 2008 bottling , red foil label . pours a chestnut brown , with a long lasting head . stalagtites of drippy lace . fantastic barrel aroma , soaked in bourbon and sun-dried , retaining it 's oaky complexity . it reminds me alot of enigma , strangely enough . woody with a slight suggestion of dried fruit . chocolate and spice . strong chocolate base with bourbon notes that verge on solventy . spicy with some black cherry flavor . mouthfeel is smooth and rich , alcohol really only detracts from the taste slightly . this is a nice sipper . more cherry lingers in the aftertaste . pretty nice anytime of the year ...

0.60 0.30 0.80 0.40 0.40	draft . little head . pours a clear light golden color . very little aroma . taste is very similiar to a macro in fact , if you told me this was some light domestic i would have totalled believed it.. slight bitter end . nothing outstanding . i was really let down by this one as i thought at least they would be able to make a decent apa , but alas , i was wrong .

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.80	the trappist . poured a deep dark reddish brown , served with little head , low carbonation . aroma of a quad / stout mix with the figs , plums and spices plus a hint of grape hi-c infused vanilla . full bodied , viscous without being cloying , chewy . taste also is a mix of a quad and a stout in a fine fashion . nearly zero bitter in the finish which lingers nicely . the alcohol is amazingly restrained , not even the inherent warmth you 'd expect at this abv level . blindfolded i 'd say this was barrel aged . an excellent sipper cheers jd

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90	probably one of my favorite pumpkin beers out there . pours a nice dark ale with a good head which clings to the glass . smell is of nutmeg and pumpkins but not overpowering like a lot of pumpkin beers . taste follows the same line , nice pumpkin taste but not a punch in the face of clove like a lot of beers i 've had of the same style . flavors of nutmeg and clove follow . great beer , love it !

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.40	a very clear , light copper color . started off with a one-inch head that receded to about a quarter-inch pretty quickly , but held there . lots of visible carbonation . a spot of lacing here and there . nice sweet , bready aroma , hint of white grape . not a bad start . hm . this is the one in the pack that has n't worked for me . just an odd mix of flavors to start . something sour prominently figures here , probably cooked veggies . maybe i 'm drinking this too warm . the hop profile leaves a bitter finish that i find somewhat at odds with the maltiness . still tastes sort of like a bock in the aftertaste , which is not something i 'd say about the rest of it . lacks any kind of fruity character , or barely even any raisin , which i would have expected . it 's just off , almost has the malt character ( corn ) of a malt liquor , some of which taste better than this . for a beer that boasts `` big and malty '' on the label , i ca n't really say i agree with either with regards to mouthfeel . it 's medium-light , sort of airy , too carbonated . i would expect more from a 6.2 % beer . there should be some more heft . gets better later on as carbonation fades . i 'm not sure if this is a style i do n't really understand or if there 's something off about this batch , but this is the weakest of the otherwise perfectly drinkable brews in the dundee pack . i drank it down , hoping it would start to taste better , and it was n't hard to glug down the last few ounces when i was n't paying as much attention . like most macros , not hard to get down when it goes from glass to stomach in just a second or two . maybe next time i save this for last instead of starting with it .

0.90 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70	big thanks to both gnemesis and pellinore1 for hooking this one up ! a - cracked the 12oz and poured into a unibroue tulip . poured a transparent pink with a pinkish creamy frothy head . head left thick milkshake lacing on the glass . looks awesome . s - zing ! berry medley . tangy . raspberry , strawberry , blueberry sweet n ' sourness , but watered down . reminiscent of blush wine . t - much like the nose suggests another berry medley explosion of flavor . the tartness is there , but seems much more watered down . m - kind of water heavy . definitely has a bit of a wine feel but kind of a letdown in the mouth . d - looked great , smelled great , and tasted pretty good ... but seemed like a watered down glass of blush wine . unique but not really my thing .

0.90 0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60	i picked up a sixer of this last night at shoreline beverages in huntington , ny . glass bottle poured into a pint glass . appearance- pours a gorgeous black color , not completely opaque , when held up to the light reveals beautiful ruby highlights , with a head that was at first 3 fingers deep ! ! however , it quickly disappated to a finger tall head . smell- this smelled like pure chocolate and coffee , my mouth was watering upon the smell . taste- this is where things get a little hairy , maybe my expectations were high on this one , but i was n't really all that impressed , it tasted like boston lager only with chocolate notes and hints of coffee . mouthfeel- somewhat typical for the style , it was creamy , definitely not thin . drinkability- when put up against other stouts , this does n't even really stand up to a guinness or murphys , however , i can see myself probably drinking this again in the near future .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	from 12oz bottle th bruges hybrid glass on 8/17/11 *from notes -- bottle purchased at the bowery st . whole foods in nyc on 7/25/11 -- a : pleasant to the eye - a good rich mahgoney brown in color . 1.5 finger head fades fairly fast and leaves minor lacing behind . s : hmmm ... .quite vinous and kinda funky . this ca n't be right . soured mash and charred barley also present within the nose . no hops to speak of . t : acidic up front , then the medium charred malt kicks in . again , i 'm not getting any hops on this bad boy . it finishes like a tart molasses cookie , with a touch of funk . m : respectable . it 's reasonably creamy , yet it does n't compare in any way to the rest of ccb 's lineup . carbonation is a bit lacking here . o : this bottle of cigar city 's maduro brown ale is in the very early stages of a brett infection . the beer did n't showcase ccb 's typical calling card mouthfeel or hop profile . i wish i had pulled a batch number off of this before chucking the bottle , as i do n't think this beer was at it 's best . i 'll certainly try this again under different circumstances , though if in fact this is the intended profile , then it 's a slight miss from joey and the ccb crew . update : on 8/25/11 , i spoke to a friend who had this on tap last weekend in philly , and he too claims that it was infected .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	12oz bottle obtained from a trade . this beers pours a hazy orange with about a one finger head . the head does n't retain for very long . i thought this beer would reek of hops , but not much really jumps out at me besides a sweet smell . the bitterness in this is upfront and very prominent . seems slightly unbalanced . low levels of carbonation and a medium body to this . it 's pretty good and i 'd definitely drink it again .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	[ best served in a lager glass ] the pour was a medium golden amber with a very thin ( less than 1 finger ) white frothy head that was fully diminishing and produced no lacing to speak of . the aroma was that of bread and grain malts , a floral hop and a sweet yeast with a note of caramel , a little fruit and a smidgen of spice . the taste was malty and a bit hoppy with a little bite of spice pretty much throughout with the ending being a little sweet with strong caramel and fruit notes . the flavor lasted an average amount of time after the swallow with the sweet fruitiness lingering a short while , leaving behind the slight bitterness of hops a just a little sourness . mouthfeel was just a little shy of medium in body with a dry , watery texture and a medium carbonation . overall a decent drinkable brew with a sweet sticky metallic aftertaste . although the moderately high abv does make it easier to partake after each swallow .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60	poured from a bottle to pint glass . a- lively looking a good amount of carbination moving , an inch of head with a bit of lacing . s- pungent a bit hoppy t- a fuller tast then i was expecting , yet crip and ends with a bite of hops . the malt base comes through a bit , but its nice . m- the carbination feels alive . d- refreshing goes down pretty easy but has a bit of an after taste . i would probably have another if i had it on hand but i would n't go out of my way to get one . notes : when i opened the bottle it poped and gave me a bit of a jump . but i think i was fair even though that pop scared me ; )

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	this one has been `` aging '' in my fridge for some time . aging in the sense that it was left in my house months ago and now needs to be removed from the fridge to make room . here we go . appearance : clear and golden . very light in color , straw colored . sudsy , soapy white head , two fingers . tons of carbonation looks like any other macro lager . effervescent smell : funky overcooked grain , corn husks , some kind of syrupy sweetness , not decipherable through the nose . taste : light , mildly sweet malt with corn-like taste . hop aroma . no discernible hop aroma or flavor . metallic , alcoholic aftertaste . mouthfeel : very light and easy to handle . almost leaves this dry soapy finish in the mouth . drinability : not having too hard of a time getting it down . for a macro lager ( and on top of that a 40oz ) not too bad . i would n't drink this one if giving a choice , but finishing a glass is accomplished with relative ease . enjoy .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80	big , chunky head atop a hazy golden body . carbonation appears a little hyperactive but otherwise just fine . faint powdery aroma is all that betrays a possible hefe . otherwise the somewhat stale , hay-like scent makes this seem more like a middle of the road american wheat beer . standard , crispy lemony kind of taste with a little bit of cotton candy on the finish . thankfully avoids the cereal husk taste that the odor would have indicated . far too thin for the style although the carbonation provides a crispness to the mouthfeel that is at least welcome in this warmer weather . drinkable to be sure although not close to the best example of the style that i 've tried .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.60	thin fluffy head retreats rapidly into nothingness . golden amber colour , sparkling clear and effervescent . aroma is a load of florally cascade hops . taste begins warm and fruity , followed by a big right hook of cascade hop flavor , finish is dry and bitter , a lingering bitter . hop flavor and bitterness overwhelms any hint of malt sweetness . the brew does leave a lingering sweetness on the lips . body is average , nothing big and chewy , nothing thin and characterless , just an average in between .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.60 0.60	belgian strong dark ale . are those the best four words in the world ? they might be . pours cloudy extra dark chocolate brown with a thin light tan head . smells of chocolate and banans . tally me banana . taste is cloves , cinnamon , and dry leather . very spicy . wow . the smell and taste are way , way different . how does that work ? mouthfeel is soft with nice carbonation . overall a good beer but , like coffee , i ca n't help but wish it tasted like it smells .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70	hazy copper color with a fluffy eggshell tinted head . takes a bit to dissipate . laces well . smells rather good , nice and woodsy with slight citrus and forward hops at the end . taste kind of fell flat . just was n't there . had a more stale hop taste , and bit of sweetness , but too bitter in the end . fairly different from the nice smell . kinda disappointed . run of the mill light to medium body . it 's not a super good pale , but its drinkable none the less .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60	picked this one up in kc , mo . not available here in wichita . appearance : this beer poured a very dark brown with hints of deep amber around the edges . the dense , tan head rose up to under one finger with an aggressive pour and fizzed away quickly . there was only a thin ring around the edge of the glass when i took my first sip , and even that was gone in only a few minutes . there was no lacing . smell : classic english barley wine aromas , if a little on the sweet side . thick toffee , light caramel , brown sugar , and maraschino cherries dominated over some tart , dark fruit . these were all puncuated by the occasional hit of strong alcohol . there was also some burnt sugar floating around in there . no hops to speak of . mouthfeel : light bodied but slightly buttery . completely flat and dead in the mouth . smooth beyond what is natural . smoothness is usually good , but combined with the light body , this beer came across bland , watery , and boring . taste : hardly any of the sweetness that was present in the smell came through in the flavor . tart cherries and dry alcohol dominated . there were light hints of bitter hops as well . a husky bitterness arose on the finish that was borderline astringent . that was about all there was to this beer . this was a good beer up until the point that i took a drink .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	mmm , some nice simple roastiness ... some decent not embarrassing like naked in a dream lacing ... medium mouth for a porter ... '' m-i-l-l-s fuck off '' ... a low end-decent middle of the road $ 35 hooker kind of beer.. and by the way , who the hell is cole porter ? ?

0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	this is a rather roasty and slightly sour barley wine , with some fairly nice coffee notes but a not-superlative flavor . it poured a dark red with lots more head than barley wines usually have . aroma is deep and a malty smell that is roasty rather than sweet and has some sourness . flavor is coffee up front and at the finish , with some out-of-place sour notes . mouthfeel is fairly carbonated , again not typical of the barley wine style . not bad .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.40	thanks to my buddy hoppymeal for this beer in the latest massive assault . pours a dark golden color with some reddish overtones and almost an inch of foam on top that does n't seem to last too long but leaves a bit of lacing . a quick swirl brings back about half an inch of foam back to life and the beer maintains a nice ring of foam throughout the whole session . opens up with a big burst of various citrus fruits like orange , grapefruit , lemon , tangerine , mango , and pineapple . aside from the citrus sweetness there is also a noticeable citrus acidity in the background . the beer has a `` heavy '' crystal malt aroma and meaty that could be either from the grain bill or the yeast . not bad , the aroma is quite deceiving at hinting at a sweeter beer instead of a bitter/astringent mess . bitter and slightly astringent upfront with a long lasting bitterness . citrus flavors pass by quite rapidly and are engulfed by the bitterness and grassiness . bittersweet orange , citrus peel bitterness , lemon , medium-high caramel malt profile with some dry toast in the finish . initially , the beer is n't too bad it starts off with the citrus bitterness and the malt tries to come through but quickly finishes in a long lasting dry bitterness that overwhelms almost anything else with a dry , grassy , piney , and intense citrus bitterness and a bit astringent as well . definitely too astringent , my mouth feels like i 've sucked on a tea bag after swallowing . moderate to high carbonation with a soft texture at first and then a very dry finish that , combined with the astringency , is not very refreshing . not really impressed by this one , the aroma was decent but the taste is lacking complexity and finness , mostly due to the aforementioned problem of the astringency/bitterness combination .

0.60 0.70 0.20 0.20 0.20	pours a nice orange amber with a pure white head . nose of honey , stone fruit with undertones of bretanomyces . a very pleasant nose for one who likes bret . thin mouthfeel with virtually no body . offensive `` bad sour '' character . a bitter sour with nothing pleasant about it . good thing-flavors are short , as is the finish . this beer is really not drinkable .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.50 0.70	pours a very reddish brown color . tan thin head disappears quickly . well , the label says brewed with peaches and pecans and you get tons of peach on the nose . and it 's a real peach smell too , not the kind in gummy candy . there 's also some farm stinkiness and sugar . the peach flavor is up front and dominates the beers . the back end is where shiner loses me a tad . the bitterness is n't well balanced and the previously pleasant peach flavor is just too much . a nice surprise and a totally different kind of holiday beer from shiner .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	this beer goes `` glug , glug , glug '' as you pour it . it lays out a hefty tannish brown head that has some staying power . color is very dark ruby , but not black . aroma is wonderful . incredibly intense malt tones and a nice sweetness detected . taste is good , but a little lighter than i expected . note that i said , `` lighter than expected . '' this beer does have some depth and complexity . but the body is not as heavy as i expected either . do n't get me wrong , this is a great brew . great tastes of molasses and sweet malt . a nice yeasty flavor . some breadiness . no hops detected , but there must be some to balance the malt load of this . this is in the elite class of doppels in my opinion ( along with bell 's consecrator , spaten optimator , sammy adams and sprecher ) .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50	i completely disagree with the beeradvocate characterization that this is an amber ale . what anheuser-busch has done is taken a sierra nevada pale ale and lessened the pale ale character to the point that is appeals to the masses . we 'll see how well that goes . the initial aroma is promising- delivering a crisp maltiness , low-lying sweetness , and a good helping of cascade hops for a grapefruity , lightly piney aroma . fair and balanced throughout the nose . flavors is where the beer begins to give way . a very well attenuated blend of 2-row and 6-row gives the beer some graininess and crispness . meanwhile the hop flavor is light and struggles for perception , while balanceing the beer fine . the body is the biggest detriment- the beer has little of a malt backbone and offers a dry , crips , graininess that edges close to astringency . no creaminess or weight to the beer . still the light grain flavors and hop bite flows well into the crisp finish . a fair beer but not among the better ones out there .

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	pours up a lovely , cloudy , honey-amber colour with a white , frothy head with magnificet retention ; looks terrific . exquisite critrusy , lemony aroma ; actually smells 'juicy ' . just amazing . flavour consists of traditional hefeweizen attributes with the addition of citrusy , american style hops . delightfully bitter on the finish . the 9,6 % abv is dangerously well hidden . mouthfeel is very smooth and pleasantly carbonated . an absolutely fantastic american representation of a classic german style .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . pours very dark amber with high fizzy foam . foam sticks but pulls away . strong toffee/caramel notes in the nose . malt too . big malt taste with sneaky hop finish . sweet throughout . some cola taste . light carbonation makes it a touch syruppy . good though .

0.50 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.70	this is one of those beers that is good for the younger crowd , one because its cheap and two when your young you really dont care that much about taste you just want to get drunk . but in my opinion this beer really isnt awful , but not the nectar of the gods either . the smell of it isnt a good beer smell what so ever but the taste is right above average in my book

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	this beer pours beautifully , however the head can overtake the glass if not poured slowly enough . the beer has a dark amber color to it , with a fair amount of carbonation . the was not my favorite part of the experience , it has a strong urea scent to it which i did n't care for , but that was more than compensated by the taste . the taste is very rich and deep , with different hops tones throughout . it has a beautiful well rounded finish , and overall is a very pleasant experience .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	the beer was kind of bitter it smelled kind of bitter and strong it had a nice rich color to it and taste exceptionally well the mouthfeel was light and it went down smooth with a bitter aftertaste . the taste was strong and left the taste with you to savor i enjoyed the beer quite a lot i would buy it and drink it again

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	2007 vintage . crystal clear coppery amber with a short , off-white cap of foam . some lacing , good head retention . very nice aroma , light alcohol , citrus/pine hops , dried fruit , caramel , doughy . kind of comes together like a honey-glazed donut . flavour seems a bit muted . there 's a lot of malt sweetness , some spicy rye , balanced more by alcohol than bitterness . fairly fruity , a little figgy . hops are mild , citrusy and floral . alcohol becomes dominant in the finish and there 's plenty of warmth and lingering bitterness . texture is a little oily , fairly full , with moderate carbonation . the alcohol is a little on the strong side considering the abv , which limits the drinkability . still , it 's pretty good and i ca n't say no to a beer made with rye .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	pours dark brown with red hues with a minimal tan head . smells like sweet vanilla milk , caramel and butterscotch tastes like sweet vanilla milk , caramel and butterscotch . finishes with a slight bitter . the vanilla lingers on the tongue . some coffee emerges . mouthfeel is medium with small carbonation . overall this is straightforward . very sweet , pretty good . 22 oz of this got a to be alot .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.40	picked up a can of this at liquor mart in boulder co. for $ 1.43 . a : pours a light copperish hue with a decent head and small amounts of lace . s : strong ( cascade ? ? ? ) hop aroma that 's earthy and floral with some malt , but the hop smell runs the show , which made me think this stuff was going to taste amazing ... t : super boozy , sweet and malty with almost no hop at all - big letdown . m : thin , fizzy and overall weak . d : poured it out half way through and moved on to the avery ipa i had in the fridge .

0.70 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.40	appearance is dark caramel brown with a small off-white collar that leaves scattered lace . smell is sweetish caramel malts and a hint of citrus . taste is very muted , some bitterness , maybe a touch of nutty malt character , but really bland , with some light phenolics . served cold , this really struggled to open up , just a hint of caramel coming through as it warmed . reminds me of a bad dubbel or something . mouthfeel is pretty dry , crisp , but with creamy carbonation . medium bodied . drinkability is n't too hot . it 's certainly not offensive , there 's just nothing particularly redeeming about it , with a mostly acrid character that certainly does n't beget seconds . not even worth the novelty .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.60	first of all , i cant say i 'm not impressed or sold by the token pin-up redhead with stockings , garter , and cleavage riding a hipster bike . if this beer sucks i 'm gon na hate it even more so . and just for the record : can ... wtf . a : quite light in color and a particularly large white head of foam . lacing all over . plenty of carbonation . s : smells great for a pale ale , smells like hops and hoping the taste measures up . t : stale . dont know what hops they are referring to from yakima valley but im guessing palisade and that has never been a favorite of mine in this style or from that region . the bitter finishes late and short which is fine for a pale ale , but the flavoring hops doesnt really grab me . m : carbonation is heavy here , possibly cause its a can and it gets shook up in ones bag on the walk home , but it has a good mouthfeel that lingers long enough between quaffs . d : i would go back to this over standard lager , as is my disposition to style . but , the hop flavoring is more metallic than i would like preventing any real pondering .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	12 ounce bottle purchased at the foodery bottle shop in philadelphia , pa. drank this a few hours ago , so i do n't remember much . what i do remember clearly is that the sweetness of the german malts really balance out the bitterness of those noble hops . an unfiltered offering from a fine brew house . a -- -

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	lady friend picked this up at whole foods . she used it to barter for some cheese . clever one that one . appearance - nice light copper-orangish color . a little hazy with a half inch of head sticking around . laces nicely all the way down . smell - very nice . i definitely get the grapefruit , and the citrus , although there is something almost astringent lingering . nice hoppy character . taste - pretty hoppy up front . definitely some of that citrus and grapefruit . cascadish i might say . can actually taste some bread in there as well . it dries pretty harshly however on the finish . almost feels like i just used mouthwash . it 's a little harsh on the back end . also , there seems to be another level where this one ca n't quite reach . i could ask for a little more complexity . mouthfeel - pretty rich . coating the tongue , and a tad syrupy . nothing too unpleasant though , pretty hearty . drinkability - pretty solid . i enjoy it , and could put back a couple . the booze is pretty well disguised . overall , this is a nice ipa . it 's got some good floral hoppiness , and decent intensity . it 's just lacking a back end , and that extra something that sets the great ones apart . still , a very solid bev . i 've always thought of it as a reliably good beer , and this has done nothing to dissuade that opinion .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80	when i pulled the cork out , a delightful smell hit me right away , but went away quickly . i thought the taste was pretty average . sweet and malty , which is good for me because i am not into a really bitter taste . i was n't blown away , but this is definitely a decent beer . i would reserve this for some of my friends that are more into wine , as i can see this beer being a good crossover for them .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.40	the beer pours a light clear yellow color with a white head . the aroma is exactly what i expected from an imported beer in a green bottle : skunked grain and nothing else . i am holding it against the brewer in my rating since it was their choice to use a green bottle . the flavor has a little bit of skunk , but not as much as in the aroma . i also get some grain and grass notes from the hops . thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	22 oz bottle with a $ 11 sticker on it . bottled july 16 , 2009 . appearance : pitch black with the slightest little hint of red around the edges . brown , frothy head with good retention . spotty sheets of lacing . smell : really great smelling chocolate aromas . sweet and bittersweet . vanilla and caramel too . a little oak . a little hint of grassy hops . taste : i did n't smell a lot of oak , but there 's quite a bit of green oak flavor . the beer is of course dominated by roasty and chocolate flavor . the alcohol is noticable and hot from the middle to the finish , and is then replaced by a long gentle burn from the cayenne . mouthfeel : full and thick in a good , big stout way . the heat from the booze and the burn from the cayenne becomes a distraction . drinkability : i think this beer would be much better without the cayenne . i 'll take the regular yeti instead . yeah , i 'm grading down the taste and the mouthfeel because the more i drink , the more i dislike the burn .

0.80 0.70 0.30 0.20 0.30	pours a very light , slightly cloudy lemon yellow colour , with a fine but thin head of white foam . lacing is pretty good . looks very light in the body , but that 's to be expected , and it goes with the other visual traits of the beer . not bad looking at all . quite pungently sour on the nose . big notes of green apple , and citrus , with huge funky barnyard characters . aromatic , but not necessarily all that pleasant , in any case . really unapologetically funky . about as raw and ragged as you get with brett . i have to respect that at least . the taste is where it just catastrophically falls apart . it 's so thin and devoid of character that i started to wonder if i 'd imagined the funkiness on the nose . there 's perhaps a slight bitterness on the front , but it disappears so completely i 'm inclined to think the flavour is an apparition . a light unpleasant yeast funk appears out of nowhere sometime after the beer seems to be gone , but that 's it . it 's so bereft of flavour otherwise , that i find myself brutally offended . mouthfeel is weak and limp - water has more character than this . what a beer of contrasts . this is a beer that drew me in with a hint of tantalising mystery , then left me tied up on a bed with my wallet and passport stolen and no memory of how i had ever got into this sorry state . i have to say i 'm bitterly offended by it in the end , and i really hope i can help someone else avoid it in the future . beware .

0.70 0.60 0.70 0.90 1.00	this october version of lowenbrau is n't like any of the other octoberefest beers i tasted , first of all it has very little bitterness , is not overhopped and goes down very smooth . that begs the question . is it really an octoberfest beer ? not , in my mind , but this is a fantastic drinking beer that you can add to your cooler for those friends who wo n't want a tradional octoberfest beer . i love the taste of this beer , very pilsner like for a beer guy like me that does n't like many pilsners but this was a really enjoyable beer . body is not heavy , smell is no special event . try it .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	always an exciting time of year when the pumpkin ales start making their way onto the local beer store shelves . 12 ounce bottle poured into a small mug . the pour gives way to an impressive amber hue topped with a spotty bubbly head . color is very autumn-y . reminds me of color changing leaves . aaahh yes , the smell is of nutmeg , faint cinnamon , all-spice and malt . not as much pumpkin as i would have liked , but still interesting . this beer tastes almost just like it smells . strong nutmeg and all-spice flavors . very slight pumkpin present..i wish there was a bit more . not much actual `` beer flavor . '' i can tell the base beer they used for this was very bland , almost as a blank canvas for this pumkpin beer to be created upon . overall i am not too impressed with this one . it 's exciting because it is a `` pumpkin ale '' but besides that there is n't too much going on..including the pumkpin part . might as well mix some all-spice into a budweiser . cheers !

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80	somewhat like a pale crossed with a lager . easy mouthfeel . trademark grand river mineral bitterness and some hoppiness . nothing special to smell or to look at ( yellowish although decent head ) . good drinkability.fresh bottle at lcbo , bottled this month . seems higher abv than listed . so-so for the style , but decent `` bitter lager '' blonde style , really .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	presentation : 12oz brown pop top ; simple but cool label , no date . this is my first weyerbacher beer , picked it up in omaha . appearance : pitch black brew with a nice light tan collar that fades to a thick , chunky ring and a decent film . smell : not overly vibrant , but pleasant . melted dark chocolate , a touch of nutty character , some light alcohol , and maybe just a ghost of roastiness . taste : flavor is n't bad per se , but it 's surprisingly muted . a touch of darker milk chocolate , a wisp of roasted malt , and a touch of boozey alcohol . would make a middle-of-the-road stout ... imperial stout ? meh . mouthfeel : a bit on the light side . drinkability : medium conclusion : no idea how old this might be w/out a date ; i 've had it myself for about 7 months . still , this style is generally fine to hold onto , so i do n't really know what 's going on here . nothing tastes bad here , but this is definitely one of the lightest-tasting imperial stouts i 've had to date .

0.40 0.20 0.60 0.40 0.40	appearance - a pale urine yellow with a small head that vanishes quickly . a small bit of lacing . smell - a very weak diacetyl and stomach acid odor , most unpleasant . taste - a little metallic , but mostly a rice lager flavor with a musky sour/bitter aftertaste . as it warms , it develops a strong stomach acid taste . a craft brew that should be drank at 33 degrees . yuck . mouthfeel - thick and foamy . better than the other aspects of this beer . drinkability - although i could drink another . i 'll pass . finishing this one is challenging enough . not the worst beer ever . but i 'll take almost anything else over it .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70	22 oz bottle split and poured into a new belgium globe glass . 7.5 % abv , 01/30/2011 . how kind of beerwolf77 to not only share this beer with me , but allow me to stroke my tick at his kitchen table ! a - faintly hazy , the color is a bronzy golden hue topped with an off-white , well-retained head . nice lace is left caked to the glass . s - dry-hopped to high-heaven , this is loaded with delicious juicy grapefruit hops that unfortunately takes a turn for the worse when the good aroma is swapped with that of chinese food . this smells like lemon chicken doused with sweet and sour sauce with cooked celery on the side . t - the malt profile consists of an overwhelmed caramel sweetness and toast . the hops burst out with potency that has an underlying citrusy fruit flavor . the chinese food comes through in the flavor but no where near as much as the off-putting aroma ( and i even love chinese food ! just not in my beer ) . this finishes with a lactic bite . m - very nice sour finish with a lactic kick and medium body . a little thin mid palette though . o - the sour finish is very good but the food aroma is pretty terrifying . the flavor pulls the overall up a lot more but it 's just an ok beer . at first experience i really would n't get it again , but seeing so many positive reviews coming off this one , i 'd love to nab another bottle and see what the deal with this one was .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.50	a : hazy orange color with thick head that settles to finger thickness and good lacing , small spiral of carbonation flows in the middle s : mild yeast aromas are overpowered by tart smell reminiscent of strong soap , citrus appears later t : tart citrus flavor abounds along with appearances of yeast , lots of spice & crisp tart flavor on the finish , faint whisky in there somewhere m : like a light cream , lots of carbonation from start to finish , very crisp d : not my cup of beer and would highly recommend most of unibroue 's other beers over this one

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70	just sampled last night at the columbia location . pours a light brownish copper . has a thick , small-bubbled white head that dissipates quickly . smells a bit yeasty . definitely fits the style , but smoother than a lot of more popular pale ales . you get a nice , sweet caramel flavor . the mouthfell is light and smooth . no overbearing flavors stick in the mouth . it goes down very easy . you could definitely slug back a few , especially on a warm day . unfortunately , you have to go to rocky run to try the beer . i think that they only offer the beer on tap at their locations .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured out of the can into a nonic pint glass . canned may 13th 2011 . a foamy three finger head is produced off the pour from the can that is perhaps off white . head on build up seems small but grows . body is a hazy murky orange color with a hint of brown , kind of swampy looking , with some tiny rising carbonation . lots of clumpy sticky retention and bubble bath character . orange , cinnamon , marmalade with a clean refreshing spritzy quality . feels like italian orange soda , with a small hint of bitter and malt behind it . just flat out wonderful , this is just an exceptional nose here . taste is wet , mild , and slightly bitter . a surprising mild baked bread quality and orange mouthwash finish , almost very rinsing agent like . mild palate coating , a hop bent strangely surrounded by mild orange/marmalade citrus that is hard to pinpoint . overall extremely nice and super sessionable drinking brew , i just wish it had a little less wet character in feel to it , but that would be hard to pull off , and that probably would n't represent the style very well . the nose on this is just flat out fantastic .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	sampled through the kindness of todd1 . this is a bottle that has been cellared since july 2006 and is capped , not corked . gentle amount of carbonation when uncapped . clear copper colored ale without much head formation despite an aggressive pour . the smell has that fruity scent that just says dfh in my mind , must be the local weather . spicy and malty scent you can certainly pick up the ginger . unexpected fig aroma and some raisins and a rum scent maybe from unprocessed sugar . grapes faint brown sugar , and bourbon . lots of subtle scents here and i am sure i am not picking them all out . the taste starts neutral and wood and tastes spicy and a bit smoky . much more subtle tasting than smelling . there is a little spice burn here probably the ginger . vanilla is present and is mostly a part of the bourbon flavor . there is a popcorn and rice flavor here that i would n't have expected , tastes exactly like jasmine rice smells . the mouthfeel is ok . certainly easy to drink and subtle but this is an easy beer to miss the subtleties in it . everything about this beer is soft and subtle and easy on the mouth .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	had this at the bruery reserve initiation . i did a side by side of each of the 3 papiers . third was the bourbon . again , the appearance was very similar to the rye and brandy . pours no head.the color was a murky ruby hued caramel brown . it seemed to be more hazy than the other two though . aroma : big oak and bourbon flavors up front . vanilla , toffee , caramel . this one was my favorite based off the aroma . taste : lighter bourbon flavors than i was expecting . there was a lot more oak here . i was a little disappointed , because the aroma was so inviting . it has lots of vanilla , toffee , and caramel just like the other versions . this one just seemed to have a lighter flavor . mouthfeel : smooth , rich , and creamy . medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation . ends a little dry with some heat . overall , this was my least favorite , not to say it was n't bad . i was just a little let down after having the first two . again , i am really shocked as how this beer hides the abv . hardly any traces . i would still like to try this one again someday .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.30 0.40	picked this up at binnys . new chicago brewery ? cool ! ( find out later it 's contract brewed in wi -- boo ! ) looks and pours like your typical belgian wit , nice fluffy head , maybe a bit overcarbonated ? good lacing . tasted ok until something rears it 's ugly head in the aftertaste/finish . could barely finish the one bottle due to the aftertaste alone .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70	appearance : looks like a witbier . no lacing . smell : wonderful aromas on this beer . exceptional taste : kinda bland . no hops at all in this one . need a little more spice . mouthfeel : tingly . medium bodied . leaves a film in my mouth . drinkability : this is an ok beer . do n't know if i 'd go out of my wat to get it again .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	so what i gather from the bottle is that this beer is n't barrel-aged , but instead flavored with oak chips and vanilla beans . whatever , it sounds good . it pours a very deep brown color , just a hint of blood red at the bottom , with a small , short-lived beige head . smells intensely of vanilla beans . strong taste of smoky wood with some sweet vanilla , but the flavor is fairly brief , mostly silent except for a bit of a roasted finish . i guess i 'm just wondering where the other flavors are -- the basic stout flavors . if this beer just had a strong oatmeal stout center of chocolate and coffee , the vanilla and oak garnishes would be wonderful , but as it is , they seem lonely . also , the vanilla dominates in the nose , while the oak dominates the flavor . all in all , tastes good , and very interesting , but lacking . could be a truly great beer . a hearty thanks to px2grafx for surprising me with this brew .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.60	poured into chimay chalice . big thanks to drhinehart for setting me up with this beer . a : pours much thinner and lighter in color than you would expect from a porter . in the glass it appears a deep dark reddish brown . there is a thin head that hangs around . lots of lacing around glass . s : the sour character of this beer is on the forefront . huge waves of vinegar and tartness on the front followed by a very sweet cocoa character on the finish . this smells unlike any beer i have ever tried . very interesting . t : like the nose , the sour character of this beer makes a huge appearance . tart cherries , cranberries , and vinegar with a slightly puckering quality . the sourness is quite intense and is followed up with very subtle chocolate character . again , the taste is incredibly unique . mf : thin body with a somewhat sharp mouthfeel from the high carbonation d : the intense sour character of this beer limits its drinkabilty . the sourness builds on the palate with each sip which after time gets a tad overwhelming . overall a great sour beer

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.70	i 've been interested in scotch and scottish ales lately . saw this one was new at the local store . picked up a bottle and poured into a pint glass . hard pour produced a two finger head ... off white/creamy in color . head turned to ring and light film after a few minutes . interesting appearance . looks like a cloud that coherently hangs together ... like there 's one substance swirling around in another . deep golden brown in the center but light golden around the edges . smells citrusy . grapefruit . a bit odd for the style . a little bready . taste is similar . fruity . a little butterscotch in the background , initially , but as i drink it down , not much aside from citrus . a smooth beer . a nice fresh carbonation , but the flavor just hampers the nice mouthfeel . although it 's quite drinkable , the fruitiness makes it not all that desirable to drink . not much alcohol , yet leaves you feeling warm ... which contrasts with the fresh , crisp taste . perhaps this beer would be more appealing if it were a different style .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	lightly hazed orange with a slab of thick , creamy foam on top . deep spicy citrus aroma , sweet and sticky . increasing pine wood , flowers , and grass as it warms . bitter hoppy flavor upfront smothering a noticeable pale malt base . citrus rind , pine resin , and herbal/floral notes . quite assertive with plenty of bite to spare . super-bitter , yet well-rounded mouthfeel . dries the whole mouth out and leaves the throat a bit warm . not the best dipa in the world , but i liked it better this time than my first glass .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	appearance : thick head , that hangs around , like a rootbeer float head . dark , but can see light around the edges . smell : unique scent , unlike any i experienced before with a stout . i ca n't quite put my finger on it . maybe a slight , very slight black licorice . taste : decent . deceptively different than you would assume with the aroma . mouthfeel : like a cool syrup in your mouth . drinkability : great finish . but then again , kalamazoo always brings a smile to my face .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	opaque , hazed-through pumpkin yellow-orange-tan colored , with a tight-cropped stained ivory head which stays quite a while . big whiffs of tangerines , honeydew melons , bubble gum , concentrated pineapple juice , honeyed graham crackers , and lesser notions of iron-rich blood , spicy tomato juice , and grapes- via a lightly woody and vaguely oxided sense of madeira . for as varied and intriguing as the nose is , the taste is fairly straitforward and unnuanced . bready malts at the onset , sweetening immediately with powdered and brown sugars , then outright to caramel and a small quanitity of almonds . this mingles with some tropical fruit hues of papaya , kiwi , and mango . it ends with and ebbing wave of pineapple and pine tar , and a riptide of mineral ( calcium , alum , iron ) bitterness . medium-full bodied with a low carbonation , leading to moments of stickiness and slackness . all in all , an okay dipa , but the nose wrote a check that the rest of it could n't cash .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50	bottle . once the cork came out on this one it shot foam everywhere , had to have a glass handy to start pouring . seemed like there would be a lot of carbonation . poured a cloudy pinkish , reddish , brown color with a foamy white head . smelled very fruite , a lot of raspberry and a little bit of sourness . taste was not as sour as i expected , actually tasted like chloraseptic throat spray on the back end . this was really hard to finish even with sharing it with a friend . for the explosion of foam upon opening there was no carbonation . just a thick and syrupy raspberry blend .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80	`` a fine beer , but no ipa '' purchased at magnolia 's wines and liquors in chatham , nj . this beer does not live up to the advertising on the label . big ipa letters stamped on the label leads one to assume they are in for some serious hoppy bitterness . not so much . ignoring the label , this is a fine beer . pours a orange hue with everlasting head . this is my favorite out of the sampler 12 pack from crickethill . a hoppy beer you can drink a few of . this is what an ipa was 10 years ago before somebody decided to crank 120 ibu 's in there beer and set the new ipa style .

0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	dark gold or light copper/orange in color . heavy and frothy foam head when poured into a glass . the nose is pretty standard and does nothing to reveal the chipotle . the attack of the beer is refreshing and clean . there is definitely some zip to the flavor that actually drinks similarly to many hoppy beers . the finish is pretty clean . where is the chipotle you might ask ? good question . after taking a sip you have to be patient and let it develop a little bit in your mouth . it is very subtle and comes to the back of the mouth and tongue well after the liquid has gone down your throat . this beer rewards the patient beer drinker . while i certainly enjoyed this beer , it is probably more the novelty than the actual quality . perhaps novelty adds to quality however . i just did my best to call the numbers as i saw them .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	enjoyed on tap at capone 's on june 16th . poured into a snifter and reviewed from notes . everything about the appearance is perfect . a beautiful deep mahogany brown body is highlighted by ruby hues around the edges from the ambient light filtering through the crystal clear body . a thick creamy and fluffy head comes majestically floated on top of the mahogany brew . well retained , it leaves thick rings of lace on the sides of the glass . a swirl to erase the rings leaves a slick oily film that forms wine-like legs as it slinks its way back into the body below . the nose , even after this sat on the bar for 20 minutes to warm to cellarish temperature is nothing exceptional . caramel and nutty malts are the highlights of a sweet and syrupy aroma . hints of vanilla from the barrels do come through . i like the bourbon barrels to be an accent instead of a focal point , but this almost seems too subdued . the flavor is better , but it does fall a bit short of the real stars of the -bal aged barleywine character . no slouch by any means , cockeyed cooper comes through with the sweet malty highlights of the aroma -- caramel and nutty notes , but also builds to include raisins , currants , and hints of dark chocolate . vanilla , bourbon , and oak are again notably absent ... or more on the periphery , really , than i would like them to be . the sweet , thick , and syrupy body is pretty much in line with my expectations for a barleywine . the carbonation is ample to open up the flavors , though i do wish more from the aroma . full on the palate , it leaves a sticky resinous finish . definitely good stuff overall . this really grew on me as it warmed , so take that as a recommendation .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	there is very little to complain about with this new belgium brew . it has fantastic light floral hop aromas . the alcohol content is n't particularly high and their are some superior apas around . but i 'll be stocking my fridge with mighty arrow pretty often .

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.30 0.40	thanks to vaidas for providing this bottle , adding lithuania to my map . vyturys ekstra is a sparkling , slightly hazy , light golden lager with a thin , dense , waxy white head that fades pretty quickly , but leaves a little lacing on the glass . the aroma is bit muted , but slightly sweetened with round , light malt . there are notes of lemon , hay , soft grass and medicine . it is light bodied and a bit chalky and alkaline in the mouth . it 's actually not too watery . this beer tastes a lot boozier than it is . there is a strong fusel taste , followed by corn , solvent and black pepper . the hops almost come through at the finish with their soft grassiness , but the toll of the alcohol ( s ) drowns everything out . this kind of tastes like a 40 . i could see drinking this in a dimly lit place , while chain smoking .

1.00 0.70 1.00 1.00 1.00	not a pungent smell at all , medium dark yellow with a nice head , very crisp taste the way a beer should be , after taste non-existent after 4 or 5 , this beer is the only beer to never give me a hangover , fairly cheap , and its not a light beer like you drank in grade school

0.50 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.80	pours an effervescent chestnut with a finger of cream colored head . a bit of lacing & zero head retention , really dragged this score down s : pumpkins & pumpkin pie spices , cinnamon , allspice , & nutmeg t : pumpkin , cinnamon , nutmeg , dryness & brown sugar up front . spices start to dominate as this warms , cinnamon & nutmeg especially , plus some squashy/pumpkin notes as well . finishes warming with nutmeg & cinnamon mf : medium bodied , fairly low carbonation & a nice warming sensation , expected a bit more malt depth though drinks pretty easy , the abv is well hidden , but lacks the total package of say , an ichabod , but i would certainly grab a sixer of this during the fall every year

0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.60	as this is my first gueze i was expecting more that what i got . the beer poured a dark straw color and smelled like dirt and fruit ( in a good way ) . the taste was very underwhelming and i was honestly hoping for something a bit more . the sourness was not very prominent and i kept get a more metallic taste towards the end which was a little off putting . all in all i 'm not sure i would try this one again very soon and will seek to find other in the same style .

0.40 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.80	now , this is coming from my beer notes , so bear with me ... this beer is suprisingly really really good . hailing from atlanta ( my hometown ) , it pours into what looks like your average pale yellow american macro lager , but with a decent head on it . smells and tastes just like it should : sweet , blueberries , with a nice malt kick to it . it 's a rather nice lil ' beer . mouthfeel is smooth , little carbonation , leaves a nice blueberry muffin aftertaste . overall : great session beer if you 're with your friends or with your family , and it 's easily available here in the metro atlanta area ... so i get this stuff often . recommended if you 're short on cash and want a decent beer .

1.00 0.90 0.50 0.60 0.70	i wish i could give this extra credit for the label , and the song that it references . a & # 8211 ; ultra-impressive out of the bottle . huge ruby-tan head , ridiculous lacing . it almost looks like a coke float , except its too dark to be coke . s & # 8211 ; phenomenal smell . smoky , with pumpernickel , and spicy herbal hops . t & # 8211 ; compared to the aroma , it still seems like the flavor has been sucked out ; like decaf coffee or diet soda . when viewed in the spectrum of something like guinness draught , it holds up pretty well . interesting flavors emanate from the aromatic elements in the nose , but they range between subdued to very subdued tones of them . m & # 8211 ; too thin , not creamy enough . d & # 8211 ; it is not my favorite , but i do love looking at the bottle .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.90 1.00	appearance : in true great belgian style it jumped out of the bottle , cloudy , chunky , gold , with pillowy white head . smell : musty , minerally , grassy . taste : great malt sweetness tempered with spicy citrus hops . mouthfeel : carbonated and full . drinkability : i think the key is balanance here . harmony between the hops and the malt . i could drink this all day long .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.80	pours a translucent amber with decent yellow off-white head - looks very appetizing . no bubbles in the glass but head removes any doubt of a lack of carbonation - very good actually . i currently have a bit of sinusitus so i think my nose is off . in any case , i do smell hops , piney , some citrus . after a second opinion i understand that i am not alone . the beer does not have much nose . the taste is a different ballgame . there is a generous amount of hops here - both citrus and pine come through and is a bit tart on the tongue . i enjoyed this thoroughly . i can only imagine how much better this would be with a fresh and recent tapped keg . delish . mouthfeel is fairly chewy , body is good , carbonation is adequate . leaves a nice tart aftertaste - like you get after a glass of lemonade . drinkability is good from what i can tell . i only had 12 fluid oz so it 's hard to tell but i can see me enjoying thin all night long . got this in a trade but i really liked it - just a different brew from a different locality . makes me realize and feel good that across the usa , people are loving and enjoying hoppy and flavorful bevs .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.40 0.50	a-slightly 'paler ' than most american ipa 's i am used to . still a decent orange/caramel , not the unappetizing neon yellow you sometimes see . s-very wild and somewhat floral , not unlike a damp pine forest . t-dry and a bit flat ( flavour , not carbonation ) . you get a nod of hops but it does n't follow through with that distinctive flavour . mellow which leaves you wanting and expecting more from the aroma . m-pleasant and a delicate balance from start to finish , in contrast to the lack luster taste . d-easy to sip and enjoy , but does not tease you for more like the top notch ipa 's always do . note : i suspect the hops have gone off a bit due to the age and storage of the bottle as the vendor is inconsistent at times .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.80 0.70	this bottle courtesy of mushroomcloud , via secret bunny '07 a - this ale pours a very dark brown with a huge root beer float-esque head , took 4 pours to get it all in my pint , too dark to note any carbonation s - roasted malts are strong but overwhelmed by a metallic/woodiness , very strange perhaps this bottle has past its prime ( i.e . someone in texas trade me a fresh one for comparison ) t - nope , this one tastes fine , just a roasted nuttiness that i had not expected , and the combination of aromas befuddled me , however on the tongue it is a masterpiece of malty-nutty goodness , with a mild hop background , quite tasty m & d - smoother than the smell prognosticated , however nicely malted and with a nice rounded sessionable flavor , quite good , surprisingly so

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	i had this brew in an 11.2oz . bottle poured into a leffe chalice glass . the color is a deep brown , speckled with yeast . there is about 1 finger of head that has a pretty good retention , leaving a bit of lace on the glass . the aroma is very spicy , mostly cloves . the taste has a pretty good spicy bite to it , but it could use a little bit more hops . the finish seems to be a little weak . the mouthfeel is only average and the drinkability is not too high . not too bad overall .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.60	served in a mug thanks to tmoney2591 for being the kvass hunter this beer pours a fizzy darkness with tan foam that fades to only a lace . the smell is a bit too potent . mostly it smells of soy sauce , sesame oil , and vinegar . that is not a good combo without a wok involved . the taste is not good either . it 's sour and bready and really a vinegar astringency making it really unpleasant . this may be one of the worst kvasses that i 've ever had ( and at this point it 's my 3rd ) . though it is repulsive to the senses it can but cut with ice and drinks like a normal kvass ... even if it does suck .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	had on draft at the brewery for the crawfish boil . a-pours a hazy reddish copper color with a nice light tan colored head . s-the nose is light , pale malt up front , notes of citrus with grassy hops behind . t-light pale and crystal malts up front , notes of caramel , big hop presence behind . pine , citrus , lots of grassy hops in back , light bitterness in the finish . m-smooth and creamy on the palate , syrupy medium body with a moderate to strong carbonation balancing . d-this is a very tasty pale ale with a great hop presence in the back , solid feel and a very well done beer that goes done nicely on a warm day .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	12oz can poured to a fantome tulip . giving this one another shot , previous servings were on-tap , but this review comes from the new cans . really like the clean design of the can , too . very aggressive pour is able to coax out a 3/4 beige head atop a light brown/amber body . surprisingly good retention and the head leaves a nice , fine film of lace with few spots . near perfect clarity with only a slight haze . smell is pretty mild with just a hint of roast malt and caramel . taste is vastly improved from the other versions that i have had . big roasted malt up front with a level of hop bitterness that still lingers but not cloying as it was in the past . the balance is this canned version is a much appreciated improvement . low carbonation , medium bodied , and it goes down smooth . extremely drinkable in a market , where most of the consumers choose bmc or abita amber , perfect tin is an excellent alternative . its not going to satisfy the hop heads amber craving , but its a nice beer with marketability and flavor that could get the swill sipping populous turned on to better beer .

0.50 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	amber sap is the color white fleeting white head ... some light malts and grapes , a hint stronger than the adjunct lager some malts bring caramel and pecan to the tongue , a little bit of bitter rubber on the back end medium light body , nice and creamy overall offers a good taste , not a deep beer in respect to is flavor profile but more than i was expecting which is nice

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	very very dark brown , not black . luxurious white head . smells of burnt toast , nuts and vodka . fortunately the taste is so very much more than the smell . intensely toasty like old lady , burner all day coffee , burnt coffee , burnt nuts , cigarette ash , and then somewhere rears forth a pepperiness that is not up front tasted , but sensed nonetheless , guttorally or whatnot . the alcohol is tasted but smelt more . mouthfeel is solid enough but not to be grouped with an american impy stout or anything of the like . it achieves bigness without being big . and the same can really be said for its drinkability , overall notes . i 'm a fan . this is kick ass and unique tambien . and yet , it 's footed in tradition and integrity .

0.40 0.30 0.60 0.60 0.70	a seasonal summer beer . the freshness date indicates it was bottled less than a month prior to arriving in my belly . it pours a hazy yellow with a small head that quickly disappeared . the first thing i noticed was a lot - a whole lot - of sediment , which i did n't expect with this type of beer . i 'm not picking up much aroma at all . tastes of lightly toasted lemon and has some bite to it . finishes a little dry with some bitterness . this would be a decent , non-offensive beer for a summer afternoon and is versatile enough to work with about any food .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	this beer is strangely a little better than the sum of its parts . poured into a wet pilsner glass using the `` hacker pschorr '' pour video from that website . a cloudy , pale straw color with a nice thick head that stuck around much longer than i expected . the aroma is a little overpowering ; sort of like a lemon-scented cleaner mixed with beer . the taste is thin for a wheat , and a little overpowered by the lemon . but surprisingly , both my neighbors and i agreed it was very drinkable , in the end . suffice it to say that this is not the highest testament to the art of brewing one will find in stores this summer . but it 's an interesting attempt , and a quite acceptable offering for a hot night out on the dec .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	first off , this is probably one of the top ten best labels i can remember seeing . the pumpkin king in his dripping robes raising his scepter is incredibly cool . the pour is also strong , with a handsome deep copper hue and a healthy cream colored head . the nose is little short of spectacular , with a blast of pumpkin spices you can whiff across the room . i know a lot of beer drinkers do n't want their brew to smell like a pumpkin pie but i ca n't imagine a better nose for the style . not the flavor explosion i was expecting , but solid caramel malts and slight hop balance combine with the expected clove and spice to carry things well enough . a warming from the alcohol commences after the second sip . the creaminess factor is unreal , definitely one of the smoothest , creamiest beers i 've ever had , not so sure if it 's authentic for the style but i like it . imperial pumpkin is a luxurious , exquisite pumpkin ale that is a must try for fans of the style but i feel its too rich for serious sessioning .

0.40 0.30 0.70 0.70 0.50	i got a 24 oz bottle of this . green standard bottle , just a bit bigger . appearance - very pale and yellow . straw colored , although good head retention . about a finger size head . smell - ugg . skunked smell fills the air . i know i dont ' have a bad bottle as this is very common with heineken . very sour . taste - not bad . a bit sour , but nonoffensive . this would be a great session beer to go with spicy food . mouthfeel - very crisp and refreshing . a bit watery , but it cleanses the palet . drinkability - since it is a bit sour , i had a hard time making it through all 24 ounces of this beer .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40	22oz bottle , bottled 12/11/09 app : straw golden with a fluffy head . medium cloudiness . for some reason , i feel like this looks a little light colored for a saison which bothers me . hence the 3.5 . smell : tart and funky with a hint of spice . sour grapes , plum skin , hint of oat-like grain , and a touch of pepper . a rather tart aroma that has me excited to try the brew -- rather curious how the flavor will match . taste : a quick bite of carbonation and fruity funk followed by a long , slow malt . a slight wine sharpness is the middle . very dry with a kick of grassy , herbal hops . the flavor seems to fall flat and the light body does n't back up the flavors that are present . it 's got some nice qualities , but something about this beer falls flat for me .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured from a 22oz bottle to a pint glass . nice amber/copper pour , but the head did n't last or lace well . the aroma was fairly balanced between biscuit , roasted malt , woodiness , vanilla/nut , and mild citrus . however the flavor was a little too imbalanced towards the citrus side , while the feel was a little too thin for a maerzen . an overall average example of the style .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	very excited to try this beer . a-pours a cloudy orange ... i 'm docking points because pilsner 's should have good clarity ... also excessive head ... s-outstanding aroma ... spicy , floral and somewhat fruity ... very inviting and the type of beer you could sit and smell all day long . t-tasty spicy/floral hop flavor ... almost pale ale like or english ipa like..very bitter dry finish ... .hops are definitely the leading component as expected ... .perhaps lacks a little malt/body to hold up to all the hops but i still find this pretty tasty and a treat for hop lovers . m-medium carbonation ... .medium bodied ... very dry bitter finish ... d-kudos to jim koch for this well produced experiment ... sure it may not be for everybody as it is as advertised over the top ... . but i found it an exciting , and tasting brew ... .one of the best smelling beers i have ever experienced .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	from a 750-ml to the glass at the mediterranean grill byo in bryn mawr . a- rich burgundy red brew ( and i called it that before i read the label ) with a thick , stout-colored head . the light that meanders through produces very pretty highlights . s- perhaps it was my surroundings , but the aroma was very subtle . picked up a little roasted caramel mingled with unmistakably belgian sour yeast . t- sours and tarts that follow the nose , with interesting fruity notes of raisins and bananas . m- effervescent and crisp , drinks lighter than its color would seem to indicate . d- very palletable and inoffensive , an easy drinker , with fruity complexities .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	just drank a pint at the bulldog tavern and emporium of fine and most excellent brews and spirits . average head and carbonation with a credible amount of lacing . smell of alcohol and malts . color was bodacious . mouthfeel was like heavenly night blooming jasmine with a hint of mirliitons and cypress buds . taste was equally balanced with flowers and trees . this brew should be in the hall of fame of eisbocks . i 'll never forget tonight and this brew even if was overpriced compared to ma favorite ipas .

0.70 1.00 0.60 0.70 0.70	into a tulip , pours a large white head atop a murky golden body . thick legs as i tilt the glass , not too much lacing though . aromas of orange peel , orange itself , orange peel , and , oh wait , more orange peel . also some tangerine , a little bit of coriander , and some floral notes . refreshing , quite complex , and just the right temperate on the citrus . the taste carries a lot of characteristics similar to the smell , with some significant hop bitterness hitting the mid-point of the palate , and unfortunately , not in the way i prefer . a bit rough and overpowering . it may be the pepper , which for me has little place in a beer with an 8.9 % abv . however , the front and finish exhibit a good amount of fruity complexity , which differs slightly from the label claiming the hop bitterness lasts throughout the finish . not quite . a thinner mouthfeel , with a charge of grapefruit washing over the palate like a freight train . wowza . overall , the dirty hop bitterness on the mid-point is not making for a smooth drinking experience here , and i do n't know if it has more to do with the high abv or the hop quality . it is stone , after all , where everything must be bah ! in your face with the hops . time will tell with this one . perhaps bottle sharing with one or two others will temper this english-style bad boy , as there are some great qualities here .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	wonderful looking beer with a massive head and lacing and citrus sunburst color.a light and lemony aroma , with a bright straw character on the pallete , light crisp fruits like pear , apple . the souring from the brett is very slight and mild . thinner and crisper mouthfeel , with a tight champaign like carbination , and a refreshing dry finish .

0.60 0.60 0.20 0.20 0.20	another mediocre offering from the `` micro-brewery '' known as sam adams . the tap boasts a double pumpkin both in name and picture on the tap handle . the beer has no pumpkin flavor or nutmeg/cinnamon or other spice that you would expect out of a pumpkin beer . to expand further : appearance : is very dark drown , and is resembling of no other pumpkin beer i 've seen before . very small , and dissipating head was present . this is honestly almost stout looking , unusual since most other pumpkin are lighter in color and typically have an orange color to them . smell : no hints of spice or pumpkin smell ; other drinkers in the bar noticed this as well . by the smell , you can tell it will be on the heavy side ( in alcohol content ) . taste : `` malty-madness '' ; as expected , no pumpkin flavoring and no spices noticed either . no real taste to be described here on a beer connoisseur website . very bland and generic . mouthfeel : as already observed , almost stout like feel in your mouth . it is quite similar to a nut brown ale ( almost ) , the beer is void of any kind of `` autumn '' flavoring.the alcohol content is noticeable , and the aftertaste is appalling . the beer literally left a bad taste in my mouth . i would stay away from this beer , unless you love maltiness masked as pumpkin flavor . as you can tell the beer was not enticing / appetizing / tasty at all . bad lines , would not be an excuse either . served into a clean pint glass , at one of the best bars around . if you rate above a c for this beer , your membership here should be revoked . ( if you do not read the sarcasm in this statement , take a deep breathe and read again ... )

0.80 0.70 0.90 1.00 1.00	appearance is a very dark , amber color . the doppelbock was poured into a glass . the initial 1-2 inch head died down very quickly . the aroma is very sweet and nutty , although not overpowering . the taste and mouth feel is where this beer really comes to life . it is very sweet when first hitting the tongue , but after lingering for a bit , the spiciness of this beer comes through . this is an excellent doppelbock . i will definitely have another .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.20 0.20	thank god it 's not 1790 anymore ... a - pretty amber with a tannish head of minimal size . s - heavy florals , licorice , sassafrass , minty t - disturbing.licorice is the first notable taste . second taste produced prominent wintergreen on the tongue . sickeningly sweet.mediciney . m/d - initially seemed oily but as the wintergreen grabbed control it seemed to get incredibly dry . it 's very hard to drink an entire bottle .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	kellys ipoa . pale golden clear yellow . nice head nice lacing . smell is of sprouted malt like grape nuts . it leaves me a little flat . the taste though is good . it hits you with a bracing hop bitterness . surprising for the lack of hop aroma . this is a good tasting ipa . as it warms there is a little spiciness . mouthfeel is light on the higher end of the carbonation scale . i could down a lot of these . definitely unbalanced with the aroma though . there is potential here for a very good beer

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	this is a very average , no frills stout . i pick up no smell what-so-ever . acceptable , some chocolate hints in the flavoring but nothing stellar yet nothing really bad either . for the low price its fine ( bought a discounted 12 pack sampler from dundee for $ 8.99 ) . if someone offers it to you its drinkable but its not worth seeking out as there are many other stouts of much higher quality and flavor than this one .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.70	poured from 12oz bottle - 1 of 5 in a double-blind tasting . a - dark brown/black , no light coming through . good head , not sticking to the glass much . s - not the best first impression . a little skunky/old smelling . not much sweetness . some grassiness in there or maybe a barnyard smell . t - way different than the smell . refreshing and not sweet at all ( compared to the other porters we 've had tonight ) . not all that much going on actually . a basic , drinkable , pseudo-malty porter taste . m - good . one of the best parts of this brew actually ! decent carbonation and this goes down very smoothly . o - really not bad at all . smell was the only off-putting element . other than that this was a basic , satisfying porter .

0.70 0.50 0.90 0.70 0.80	a strong blonde ale . such a pale yellow , straw color , but attractive . pours a coarse foam at first , but nice carbonation lingers to spritz up the powerful tastes . kind of a dull thump of a beer , but enlivened by spicy and hard to identify flavors . definitely a canned fruit cocktail fruitiness , but quite pleasant . there may be hops , but very subdued . main impression is a strong alcohol and white wine taste with some champagne carbonation and a pleasing , fruit salad aftertaste . truly wierd , and personally i like the darker quads better . i 'd call this one an ultra-strong golden ale rather than a `` quattro . ''

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70	bottle into dinner glass in high altitude denver , co. a : pours a four finger maroon head with lots of cream . non-transparent dark amber/red colour . excellent retention . very inviting . am : blackcurranty yeasty heaven . perfect fruit scent . i 've brewed a blackcurrant beer or two and this is very well done . clean , pleasant , and wonderful . almost erotic , even - i want this beer to have my abortion . t : sweet fruity lambic blackcurranty goodness through and through . perfectly balances tartness with elegance . not too bitter like blackcurrants themselves are . adding fruit in secondary was a good idea . mf : wet and coarse where it needs to be . the style requires this mouthfeel . refreshing . dr : hides its abv well especially for a fruit beer . the price is high but the taste is better . avoids the izze drink imitation taste of beers like great divide 's raspberry . very well done . a bit too wet though . not as complex as it could be . the oak does n't come through in the taste , but this is probably for the best .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.70	22oz bomber . not that impressive to look at . poured into a standard pint glass . black as night with a small head that did n't last long and little in the way of lacing . second half of the bomber looked a little better , but the head still did n't last very long and did n't leave that much lacing . smells awesome ! although not especially beer-like , more of a dessert like smell . sweet and vanilla aromas dominate , with some roasty dark notes . you can instantly smell it the moment you open up the bottle , and it only smells better and better in the glass as you drink it . taste is heavily sweet with tons of vanilla , gobs of brown sugar , almost like drinking a dessert . there 's some dark , roasty notes and some vanilla cappuccino , but nothing in the way of hops . body is pretty full and very sticky from the sweetness . carbonation is n't bad , light but ample , despite the lackluster appearance . overall it 's very interesting stuff , a bit oddball but certainly worth trying . i 'll certainly buy this one again . prepare to drink a lot of sweet beer when you open a bomber , or else plan to share this one with a friend .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	cheers to goblinmunkey7 for half of this beer review adapted from notes taken 6/4/11 appearance : a robust , golden orange - nice lacing , head is kind of fluffy , kind of creamy smell : absolutely reeks of cedar - this smell reminds me of a chest that my parents use to store sweaters , and the result is complete olfactory confusion - after much contemplation , i have decided that i love this - aside from the cedar , the aroma has some nice pale , biscuity malts and some tropical fruits - some citrus , some pine taste : really interesting , but really not that mind-blowing - nicely balanced hops and malts - sweet , biscuity but mostly pale malts - hops are the typical jai alai affair , juicy and tropical - a lot of grapefruit , sweet and bitter - the cedar works really well with this , adding what seems like additional bitterness and a tangy/tart hint mouthfeel : medium body , very smooth , nicely carbonated overall : so weird , but so good there are so many permutations of jai alai that keeping track is a challenge . this is the best one i 've had thus far . at first the smell made me think that i should n't consume this liquid , but after i got over that , it was quite enjoyable .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	i quite enjoyed this . pours a cloudy mahogany brown into the glass with a big head that settles to a heavy film . minimal spotty lace . smells wonderful . cloves , banana , caramel , fruitiness . a very pleasant beer . thick and creamy mouthfeel . taste is gentle , no overpowering cloves like some others in the family . nice comfortable warmth from the alcohol . quite solid overall . not something i could see drinking a ton of at a sitting , but delightful as a one off .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	750ml bottle with cork cap . appearance : beautiful murky caramel color with a hint of dried apricot . smell : amazing sweet english butter toffee with candied strawberries . a nice mineral freshness buried amongst the sweetness . taste : butter toffee , candied fruits , overripe banana . very very rich and delicious . mouthfull : thick and smooth exceptional beer by another great quebec brewery .

0.70 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.90	i 'm almost done my lakes of muskoka mix pack . all 's i have is the lager left . frankly given that only the cream ale has been a disappointment , i 'm eager to try this one . appearance : a solid brass color that fares better then most for the style that produced a respectable amount of lacing . the pour produced a thumb of head that sadly did n't stick around . smell : started with nothing but as it warmed up some citrus wheat notes with touches of apple , barely , corn and some kind of acidic tone i ca n't quite place . taste : nice albeit a bit odd , this beer does n't really start out with much , maybe a light corn note but it turns to a very quick blending of wheat , biscuit , apples almost to quick to pickup before it rounds out with a subtle spicy hop taste with a mainly lemon citrus zest . mouthfeel : the carbonation is well done , although i wish the head had retained better . that lemon end sticks around for maybe 3 seconds before it 's gone leaving you with a mild hop aftertaste with a bit of hard water that lingers just a bit too long . drinkability : well , there is where light beers are meant to excel and this one is no exception . smooth going down , and refreshing as all heck . it 's a great lawnmower beer but the carbonation likes to play some tricks after it 's down . final thoughts : i really hate to use the cliche response , but `` for a light beer '' it 's quite good . lets be honest , there 's a time and a place for drinking light beer , and usually it 's at the cottage , which is the intention behind this beer . give it a least one shot .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.70	appearance : poured from the `` 1 pint , 0.9 oz '' bottle into an imperial pint glass . the beer is a very dark reddish brown that , when held to light , is clear . head is 2 fingers thick and light tan with somewhat poor retention . smell : a surprisingly faint aroma , which was somewhat of a turnoff since i love the big malty aroma of doppelbocks . still , there is some of that here , containing a nice , albeit slight , aroma of roasted malts , caramel , and an almost buttery note floating around in there . taste : the aroma lied . this is a very rich beer with all of the features i love so much about doppelbocks . huge malt punch , primarily caramel with a slight chocolate note and a hint of toasted bread . balance comes in the midpalate , where there is some faint balancing hop - just enough . finishes very smooth with a slight , fleeting alcohol burn in the back of the throat , just to remind you of the 7.4 % ...

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	tasted june 25th 2011 ( from notes ) poured into a la chouffe tulip a - deep copper , one finger off white head and some lacing s - lots of alcohol , very hoppy , pineapple , pine , grass , very yeasty , sweet malt , sugar , high octane everything , flowers , grass and tons of everything awesome t - really sweet up front and than a wall of bitter . nice yeast , lots of citrus and/or tropical fruits , sugar , sweet and complex malts , alcohol , pine and what seems like earth and/or wood/oak m - big , carbonation , somewhat chewy , medium acidity , full bodied , nice balance and long finish d - huge , complex , full bodied ipa . copious amounts of hops malt and awesomeness . this is a great ipa . i am starting to be a big fan of yulesmith final thought - 8 % + abv and only $ 7 a bottle . this one is worth it and if you find this on tap somewhere , please email me

0.40 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.50	appearance - medium to dark brown body , more toward the dark . the head is minimal and what is there fades extremely fast . smell - the scent of brown sugar and slight spice . there 's a hint of what could be apricot . taste - it has a musty , dark , grainy flavor . the taste is unique but not very complex . it has a subtle bitter finish . mouthfeel - the feel is coarse and i do n't think it assists with brining out any flavor . ~ i really used to like this beer . the final score used to have it on tap when i was in college . i seem to have grown away from enjoying what this beer has to offer .

0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	not sure which year appearance : pours a murky red/copper with an extemely thin filmy amber head . minimal lacing and head retention smell : fruit , leather , sourness , alcohol & fruitcake-like notes taste : alcohol , plums , dates , raisins , whisky/oaky notes & intense dryness , some tartness with vanilla sweetness in the finish mf : chewy yet effeverscent , good balance of malt , carbonation and spiciness good drinkability , a little too heavy to translate into a session brew . a bit too ponderous & intense for me , but a nice nightcap or dessert bier . survived it 's crossing well . will tempt me to try other belgians here . held off until i could figure out which store cared for their beers

0.90 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.70	22oz bottle poured into a pint glass . a : pours a dark amber caramel color with a finger and a half of off-white head . the head dissipates quickly but leaves a nice ring around the glass with a thin film across the top of the beer . the lacing is really good . s : sweet candy malts and sweet tropical fruit stand out . the alcohol peaks through but barely . the hops also give a bit of a floral aroma . really enjoyable . t : sweet malts and slight hop bitterness . lots of booze here ... kinda overruns the taste . leaves you with some hot breath . m : medium to full body . chewy and smooth mouthfeel . notes : the flavor was n't nearly as dynamic as the aroma was and that was a disappointment . the booze just covered things up too much .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured 12 oz . bottle into a pint glass . clear amber body , light head left lace rings on the glass . slight sour smell . difficult to discern other/any aromas . peppery cascade hops up front , sweet malty background . modest carbonation . thin body , raspy texture . nothing stands out about this one .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.60	poured into a pint glass a : dark liquid ? i expected golden . it does say dark on the label though . 1/2 finger of tan head from an aggressive pour . poor head retention . clear dark brown almost black liquid . porter colored . s : dark chocolate , coffee , barley graininess . really delightful . very nice aroma sits about halfway between a brown ale and a porter . t : dry , bitter from roasted malts . one dimensional . needs more hops to balance the sweetness . nice alcohol nuance at the end of the glass . merely okay . m : dry and a tad watery , but still bitter and bold . boldness stops a tad short for me . d : pretty easy drinker . i would move on to another beer at a bar , and i do n't think i 'll buy this one again .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	from a corked bomber ( that , despite its all-business label , looks amazing ) provided by my amazing lady friend who thankfully has a friend who goes to medical school in montreal . oh , how i wish i could visit this wonderful beer city more often ! a : pitch black . i guess the head 's lighter than some beers of this style , but its off-white qualities just remind the drinker of its unique astringency . the beer itself would struggle to reveal itself in even the most gothic of settings . completely . black . s : the smell leaves a lot to be desired . this beer obviously needs to be aged , because at 10 % alcohol , it is quite difficult to get a good whiff of . sure , there 's some oh-so-subtle chocolate , some anise , some smoke . but the smell does n't do the taste any justice - it 's like a bad trailer for a good movie . t : the taste gets things going . despite the high alcohol burn ( that is expected after the amazingly neutralized odor ) , this beer delivers a dark chocolate sweetness that is never too bitter , followed by anise and dark fruits that do n't necessarily brighten things up but do excite the tongue - as this is a no-nonsense baltic porter that does n't fuck around with too much motor-oil looking 'choco-tastic'ness . it 'd be impossible to confuse this dark masterpiece with the stuff they use to flavor chocolate milkshakes at mcdonald 's , that 's for sure . m + d : the mouthfeel and drinkability go hand-in-hand on this one , as [ especially the mouthfeel ] they suffer from the booziness of this brew . it 's not supposed to feel so overwhelming as it does on the tongue , but it ca n't quite help itself but to hit you up with some major levels of quickly-evaporating alcohol notes . the reason i give the drinkability a higher rating is because if you like the taste , you 're more likely to cut the mouthfeel a fucking break . if you find this , buy a bottle . but do n't go crazy - this is n't just any baltic porter - give it a try first and see if you can handle les trois mousquetaires ' interpretation !

0.80 0.30 0.70 0.50 0.50	i 'll start by saying these light almost lager like ales are not my thing and i 'm not a big fan of nitrogen taps so this probably is n't the beer for me but i ended drinking it so i decided i 'd review it . it pours nicely and the nitro tap gives it that cool lava lamp effect . if i closed my eyes and gave this a sniff test i would swear this was a corona . not good . upon first taste it is nice and creamy but has an unnatural bitter after taste that becomes more pronounced as it warms .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40	a - cloudy dirty straw color with 2 fingers of white head and no lacing . lots of floats s - sweet and sour apple candy with some belgian yeast and spice . very pleasant t - kind of like a apple jolly rancher diluted into water . extremely crisp m - medium body high carbonation a little harsh d - not bad but i was expecting it to be sweeter which would have helped a ton . also there is way to much carbonation to be enjoyable

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	this beer has me thinking black forest cake already ... .mmm . nice and dark cherry walnut in color . head seemed fizzy and unimpressive though . certainly smells nice , especially as the beer warms a bit . nice combo of coffee , dark chocolate , and just a hint of cherry . maybe the aroma is a teaser . all flavors are pale in relation to the rich aroma . they certainly match the aroma . i could taste coffee , chocolate , and a hint of cheery . but a light sourness combined with an overall watery weak taste keeps this porter from must have status , which is too bad because it is quite affordable . next time i am in penticton i will certainly stand in line to sample it fresh though .

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90	props to chris for this super fresh bottle , batch 192 , bottle # 117 ... pours a murky light gold , dark in the middle , a little ugly . a nice white head , great retention and lacing ... the aroma is fantastic , so fresh , just plucked pine needles with pineapples and an assortment of tropical fruits ... taste is equally great , bitting pine and alcohol of a dipa , but muted and so drinkable . this is awesome , must try .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	on tap at youngssportsgrill in broussard , la - dark copper , off-white head , creamy . noticable notes of malted grains , warm bread , floral . smooth and earthy..dough hoppy -an in-between style : amber ale , pale ale , ocktoberfest , altibier ... . not sure what to call it , but cest bon .

0.40 0.50 0.20 0.20 0.30	a - ivory colored head with a soda-pop fizz consistency that dissipates quickly . ripe orange color and about as murky as beer gets . s - quite citrusy and a boatload of tangy white grapefruit character . lots of alcohol , too , similar to a peach liquor . t - tons of malt character , but honestly too much ethanol flavor to concentrate on anything else . way too sweet for any type of witbier . hot fermentation combined with spices give this beer a grape flintstones vitamin flavor . m - thick as cough syrup and no carbonation to help . o - the worst offering from sam adams i 've had to date . much too hot and sweet without any complexity and completely overwhelming . avoid !

1.00 0.60 1.00 1.00 1.00	a - lots of action and lots of pale tan head ... a good 3 inches or more . the head is light and airy leaving a sticky film along the glass . the body is a perfectly clear orange . i really do n't know how she could be any better looking . s - it has the classic soap aroma found with many belgian brews . it also a has a flowery scent . t - bubble gum ! ? that is extremely unique . i has a smooth transition from fruit filled flowers to subtle hop goodness with a finish just bitter enough to remind you to have another sip . m - the feel starts out watery but like the look and taste of the brew the feel has a uniqueness that makes it great . halfway through it feels like it actually evaporates from my tongue . this leaves a dry coarse texture that assists in bringing out the hop flavors . ~ for those who feel i 've over rated this brew i beg of you , jusdge each characteristic individually . i think i 've justified my ratings here . i am extremely impressed with this sam adams original . i will certainly be venturing back to dan 's liquor in search of more . i hope this time to pick up a six pack as opposed to just an individual bottle . .. here i come dan !

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	750ml bottle ( cork & cage always cool ) purchased at carmel mtn . ranch ca bevmo . a darker amber pour , 3/4 finger bright white head . fruit in the nose , sweet apricot perhaps . slightly musty , too . that apricot note is dominant in the nose and taste . i was expecting a lot more , as i tend to enjoy the garde styles . there 's something in this interfering with some of the better aspects of the taste , its not carbonation to the eyes but sort of has that over-carbonated feel on the tongue . decent sweetness , not overbearing . a non-tart , non-bitter sourness , if that makes sense . the highlight is the apricot taste , with a slight floral zip . true to style which is worth a lot , but i do n't feel this is a beer i 'd aggressively seek a repeat of .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.40	i had high expectations for this beer , having heard good things about it . i was underimpressed . i gave it high marks for clarity . too much head . no matter how i poured it ( at 40 degrees into a room temp glass ) i ended up with 80 % foam . the head was beautiful though , white and lacey . i detected zero hop aroma and very very little hop bitterness . no alcohol flavor either . the sweet , slightly burnt malt and sugar profile came through strongly . lots of candi sugar i guess .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	500ml bottle poured into a pint glass . a thin layer of yeast sediment remained in the bottle . adeep , dark , rich brown ; about a 1 inch thick foamy head that disappeared quickly , light lacing on the glass sspicy with a strong plum scent ; a little banana and clove aroma as well . i do not like plums so i am not enjoying the smell as much trich mild chocolate taste with nice combo of raison , caramel , and clove flavors ; a little floral as well mstrong carbonation ; somewhat slimy to me , but finishes really nice denjoyed trying it due to the positive ba reviews . i can clearly see why it is rated so high . i liked the taste very much but the smell was a little strong and foul for me . this is my first wheat doppelbock so i do not have a comparison . the presentation , taste and mouthfeel are wonderful . i just do n't care for the smell as much .

1.00 1.00 0.60 0.60 0.60	new holland mad hatter ipa 12 oz bottle recent bottling , tumbled down the rabbit hole 10/06 medium pour in a tulip glass . poured a hazy copper orange with a frothy mostly lasting white head with excellent lacing . smelt of moderate lemon/lime and floweriness . taste was upfront strong grassy nutty bitterness with light lemon accents followed by a strong earthy resiny bitterness accompanied by a moderate toasty bitterness on a long slighltly bittersweet flowery finish . mouthfeel was medium bodied , watery on a dry finish , soft then lively carbonation , with heavy astringency . overall , a seemingly pleasant ipa , that tastes wonderful at first , but then bites back too hard and dies flowery . it 's like an a.d.d . hop . the hop taste is too generalized and all over the place and not enough malt backbone to settle it down . still pleasant on the nose and eyes and foretaste though .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	from notes , consumed the day of the release . pours a dark chestnut brown color with ruby/mahogany edges and a one finger light beige head that quickly settles into a thin ring . spotty lacing left behind . odd aroma with a blend of earthy oak , funky yeast , cocoa and sweet malt . i 'm not picking up much vanilla but the sour chocolate presence is really strange . that combined with the oak make for a unique nose but not in a good way . medium bodied with again , an odd combination of flavors . lots of earthy oak and sour funkiness up front countered by dark malt and sweet chocolate . similarly to the aroma , i 'm not picking up any vanilla at all . it might be there but with everything going on it 's lost to me . funky without being acidic with sweetness from cocoa and malt making for one strange beer .

0.40 0.20 0.30 0.50 0.60	im currently sipping a can . it 's an average college beer . cheap and to the point . 12 bucks a rack . smells a hint of corn , and tastes like an aluminum can , just as the case refers . overall not a bad batch . if your looking for a cheap drink water is the way to go ? if you want to get drunk this is your brew . stay classy america

0.70 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80	second beer in a row i 've reviewed that misses it 's style that it is named for but is fairly better as an american wheat beer . the bottle has neat graphics explaining how to pour this beer , and it did pour exactly as a hefe should , cloudy as hell , good head , but there was no particulate in the glass . it smelled more like a wheat beer than a hefe , and that tended to play out . in the mouth is was good , thicker , good foam but seemed to end with the `` bottled '' note , not as fresh . it had a great flavor for a wheat beer but missed the hefe branding . very wheat flavored , just a taste of fruityness like a hefe should have but nicely balance with the alcohol making an appearence at the end . as for drinkabliliy , i could drink these a lot as a nice summer beer . i 'll have to try other shiner beers if this is representative ...

0.80 0.30 0.70 0.60 0.30	a-pours light amber with almost no head , just a thin ring of soapy , bubbly head . s-ugh . smells like stomach acid . or like vomit after you 've drank a carton of orange juice . t/m-not much happening here , except for the light bready notes mid-palate . tastes like bready malts/carbonated water . medium bodied with moderate carbonation . d-nope .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.60	2 pints to get a proper feel for this one . eye candy : deep dark garnett red , brown center . fizzy tan head . no lacing . head vanished quickly . easily swirled . the nose knows : roasted malt , expresso , burnt brown sugar , toffee , hickory bbq tang , hop bitterness to balance . alcohol detectable at end . tongueland : very thin m/f for a porter . expresso , bitter chocolate covered hops , quick bittering and alcohol evident in the finish . bender : an average porter in taste at best . this is something that needs time to improve to let the mouth develop/emerge . the nose is more diverse . no detection of anything smokewise . left me wanting more in terms of complexity . i honestly had high expectations and gorges fell off the cliff .

0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	served on-tap at the shell house in savannah , georgia . pours a light amber with a paper thin white head . no smell whatsoever ... like , absolutely nothing . tastes very light and fruity , reminds me of magic hat # 9 . very thin . you can put a few back quite easily , however . i was n't too big of a fan of this , my first georgia brew .

1.00 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.70	22 oz . bottle , a : pours yellow-orange , with a very long-lasting white head , great lacing . s : orange zest , sweet malt notes , light . t : very sweet beer , the orange predominates , but it 's not overbearing . bready malt and a bit of earthy hops round out the flavour . m : can be cloying from the sweetness at times and a bit too much carbonation . overall light-bodied , medium viscosity , smooth . d : an interesting fruit beer from alpine . i 'm just glad it was n't filled with artificial flavour and one could easily drink it . well done alpine .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	750ml bottle shared 6 ways . thanks , mark . a : amazing - black as night with very dark brown head . the head retention is impressive . s : lots of booze , bourbon , light chocolate . some roasted malts in the background . lots of dark fruit . the aroma is surprisingly subdued . t : a surprising amount of roasted malts , but dominated by chocolate . well integrated bourbon . there is very little booziness in the flavor . far , far less than wws and black tuesday by comparison . m : the thickest beer i 've ever had . carbonation is perfect . o : i was skeptical as i tend to dislike the higher abv imperial stouts . i 'm also not a huge cuvee delphine fan . however , this beer was the highlight of the day . well worth a shot .

0.40 0.50 0.20 0.20 0.20	i am with the other person that said this must be what mexico tastes like . maybe this was made as something to drink the day after you funnel a gallon of tequila , i do n't know but i 'm surprised so many people rated this as `` not so bad '' or better ... it tastes a bit `` limey '' and is very thin , has a decent smell if you are n't looking for the smell of beer . the aftertaste is worse , if you are looking for anything that starts w/ teq- , go w/ the real thing , i would much rather drink a beer , but never again one that is considered beer but trying to be tequila ...

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	served on tap in a leffe glass at the little pub in ridgefield ct . pours a golden bronze color - very easy on the eyes . there was a tinge of white foam left from the pour and the beer laced well . smell was mostly uniteresting . bready , malty , but subtle and light . taste is a very pleasing mixture of malt and spices . familiar belgian notes but far less dominant than in the big belgians . creamy in the mouthfeel , really nice carbonation . its not a oomplicated beer but that doesnt mean it isnt really good . i enjoy a good leffe when i can get one , especially on draft .

1.00 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	rerate on 7/6/09 . on cask with amarillo hops at daily pint , santa monica . absolutely amazing grapefruit , lemon , and orange aroma . also has a touch of sweet toffee and vanilla . this was a beautiful hazy golden pour , with typical cask frothy head . very well balanced flavor , then a wonderful dry bitter finish . this is an amazing brew , and the cask only adds to it .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	presentation : pint glass from cask . appearance : clear , amber-red colored beer with very nice , smooth white foam that lasted a while and left some lace . smell : very , very faint smell of malt and floral hops . taste : very smooth , creamy , slightly sweet , with good balance and a nice hop finish . mouthfeel : smooth , clean , soft , but a tad thin on the body . drinkability : good , smooth , easy to drink . fairly hopped for this class .

0.50 0.40 0.70 0.70 1.00	a : light gold with a very small and thin head that dissipates quickly . s : grainy , light malt aroma with just a hint of hops , but you almost have to be looking for the hops to pull out much hop scent from this beer 's nose . t : crisp and clean with a light malt flavor following the nose , just a hint of hop back in the slightly bitter , dry finish . my flatmates in berlin drank this beer to hell and back , and for good reason : it was 19 euro cents per bottle . for that price , it 's a solid example of an uber-sessionable german pils , but it 's not something to go out of your way looking for .

0.70 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80	a - pours a clear toffee brown with a two finger tan head . great retention and lacing on the head . s - slight malt and wheat but not much else . t - surprisingly sweet at first with tons of wheat flavor , and hints of brown sugar and spices . finishes dry and hoppy and overly boozy . m - light bodied and slightly overcarbonated . d - definitely drinkable on a cold winter night , as i can attest to . overall , this is a decent dark wheat lager , but nothing overly special . worth a try .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.50 0.50	from thecarster1 as part of the review this ! bif 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass best before 11-10 pours a crystal clear garnet with a one finger off white head that leaves light rings of lacing . aromas of sweet caramel , brown sugar , clove and other spices . nice , very sweet malt up front , caramel with some chocolate in the middle . then the finish has a very bitter lemon , like the pith not the rind and the spices come in to overpower . light carbonaiton , medium body with a chalky mouthfeel with a solid dry finish . looks , smells and starts out good but the finish ruins the drinkability in this one , not balanced at all .

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.90 0.90	this beer pours a nice , dark , reddish brown . the head is light cream , and fads quickly leaving a thin ring around the glass . it was poured into a standard pint glass , and is about 50 . it does not have a strong nose , but i did catch a hint of malt and almost a coffee smell . i 'm not noticing some of the other more subtle scents others are . the beer has a nice malty flavor . i 'm also picking up the belgian sugars and just a hint of sourness . the finish is smooth . mouthfeel may be a little weak , but i would n't go so far as to call it watery . i actually enjoyed this beer more than i thought i would , and would definitely drink it again if available .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.70 0.70	on tap at blind tiger during their hill farmstead event . some confusion about this beer , i believe they may have mislabeled this a hill farmstead project but still wrote grassroots limoncello . anyway , excited to try what i thought was hf , i attempted to order one , but the keg would n't pour . a day later , i returned to test the waters . all that could be poured was a glass of half foam , with a pittance of beer in the bottom . giving it time , it settled into a reasonable , and extremely interesting , pour . golden and fairly clear . i bring to my nose the first digestif ipa i 've ever encountered . yes , it smelled like limonfuckingcello ! it smelled of small and fancy italian restaurants where the owner sits down at your table to chat . it smelled of the mediterranean sea and beautiful , long-legged , not to be fucked with , italian women with sensuous lips . unfortunately , it is exactly what it smells like . a very sweet , lemony ipa that is excellent for what it is , and enjoyable , for a time . i dont think i could drink more than a half pint . at least , not without a canoli for company .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured into a sexy weizen glass , a gorgeous copper with a two finger head . lots of carbonation made the bubbles put on quite the song and dance - cascading majestically from the bottom of the glass for excellent head retention . sadly the lacing was lacking . aroma of sweet tropical fruits , namely pineapple , and the usual malts & hops . a truly wonderful bouquet . taste accents of hops and light fruits , again pineapple , with a delayed afterthought of hops bitterness at the back of the throat . a lot of carbonation in this one . the taste is not as sweet as the smell , which is a good thing for a pale ale . another delayed aftertaste i got was ripe blood oranges . a tasty and sexy organic brew .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	i bought four 2008 vintage a couple of weeks back , with the intention of cellaring them , so i figured i should try one fresh first . poured from a cellar temperature 275ml bottle into a chalice ( bush brand ) . a - amber in colour . pours with a small head that completely vanishes after a couple of minutes . carbonation seems very lively . looks almost like brandy after it has settled . s - the first thing that hits you is a bourbon alcohol smell , which is quite potent . there is a clear sweetness , maple syrup , toffee , butterscotch , caramel , you get the idea . there is a hint of apple in there , and maybe plum . the aromas are incredibly complex , i 've never smelt anything like it . t - the taste is sweet at first , with a syrupy honey taste , which has a slight vanilla quality to it . this makes way for an earthy bitterness in the finish , with a hint of green vegetables . m - it feels very thick and syrupy . no real carbonation in the mouth . d - probably the biggest aromas and flavours i have experienced in a barleywine . it is incredibly sweet , it makes your teeth ache just at the thought of it ; maybe this will lessen with cellaring . ca n't wait to taste it again in a few years after it has had chance to mature .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.80	got this as an extra , heard it was excellent . a - color is not m favorite , it reminds me of a flawed homebrew i made a few months ago , dirty brown in color like muddy water . good head , about 1.5 fingers let leaves good lacing after it leaves . s - the smell is a fruity delecious aroma , barley , dates , almost a berryish smell t - creamy , definitely alcoholic taste , but not to strong so ts all good m - very smooth , with just a littel bit of an alcohol bite and a tastey lingering aftertaste . d - this is definitely mroe then jsut a sipper , ive been taking mouthfuls pretty quickly and my mouth still begsfor more .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	a : orange copper color , almost no head s : floral hops , not much else but thats ok with me . i love the way this beer smells ! t : tastes like it smells . floral hops , some citrus m : lightly carbonated d : one of themost drinkable beers i 've ever had . i 've had this beer from a growler and it was even better . why do most of my favorite beers end up being limited release ?

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a pint glass . a : crystal clear coppery amber in color ; good off-white colored head of about 3/4 '' reducing slowly into an uneven layer of bubbles . good lacing . it just looks pretty ! s : faint aromas of moderate malts and light hops . t & m : relatively light weight on the tongue with a fuller than expected taste . the malt comes on strong in flavor without being sweet . the balance with the malt and hops is very good and quite nice , with a result of a brew with a slightly dry edge . the carbonation in this was fine but abundant and contributes quite a bit to the overall mouthfeel . the finish is mostly clean with just a bit of maltiness on the linger . d : a cut above average , this is an enjoyable brew to drink . it 's similar in so many ways to the boston lager but there is a nice edginess to the flavor that i like in a brew . recommended .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	rich red colour , quite clear , with a thin off-white head and a bit of lace . herbal , vegetal aroma with a bit of caramel malt . mild bitterness , herbal hop flavour . malt is low , but has a brown sugar character . lingering herbal hops in the finish . light body and a bit slick . the aroma kills the drinkability off for me .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80	well i loved this beer . it is overpoweringly fruity and has an amazing aroma . it pours a cloudy light rose pink with a huge head.you are overwhelmed by the raspberry nose . the taste is smooth , raspberry 's and sweet wheat , there is the slightest hint of hops it it too ( really ) but you have to dig.the finish is the worst part of the experience as it is sweet and sticky . this beer is so overwhelmingly fruity i could see some people challenging it being a beer ... but read the ingredients ... it is and i like it .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured from a 22 oz . bomber partly into a 21 oz . bodum double-wall glass , with the rest going into a sam adams sensory glass . a - bright orange amber with a dense , foamy head that dissipates to leave a foam collar and lots of patchy archipelagos of lacing . s - slightly sour and horsey on the nose , somewhat saison-esque , with a brighter malt/hop aroma in the background . t - an interesting , effervescent kick remniscent of fizzy candies or alka-seltzer , making way for fresh grain , a distinct nutty flavor , and some citric hops , leaving a not too dry finish . m - enough weight on the tongue and medium carbonation . fairly standard here . d - finishing off this bomber was easy work with an average abv and interesting yet not overwhelming flavor . overall - if this came in smaller bottles , i might buy this way more often . it 's a unique brew that just seems to hit the spot for me . now to wait and see if there will ever be a beer challenge on iron chef .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.60	hazy dark brown-orange with a decent head . smells nearly exactly like pumpkin pie . tastes pretty much like pumpkin pie too , with a long pumpkin pie aftertaste . not a lot of beer flavor , but if you like pumpkins , and pumpkin pie , and spices , this has it . mouthfeel a little thin . this was my first pumpkin beer , and it 's not a style i 'm particularly enamored with . i would n't want to drink 2 of these , but it was an interesting experience - this definitely captured the flavor of pumpkin pie .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	another beer i got from digita7693 . thanks man . pours a crisp clear pils color . decent head and lacing . aroma is not much . just pils lager aroma . taste is great . crisp and refreshing . great marzen taste . nice malt backbone . mouthfeel is nice and crisp . great carb . overall an awesome session like beer i could drink alot of . ca n't wait to go to germany and drink some of these from the source .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured into a tulip from a just-filled growler . purchased a growler of this for $ 6 on a wednesday . what a bargain . the temperature was a little bit warm at 50 degrees . a- growler makes nice popping sound when opened which is real nice . one finger head slowly fades to coating . beautiful amber color with small bubbles in middle running to the top . s- very sweet and malty , but not so much hoppy . a small wiff of piney hops is available but not strong . i would not suspect this to be a ipa . the hops presence began to show as i was drinking . t- quite tasty . very nice balance between the hops and malts . a dry hops taste tingle 's a little but very piney . alcohol is amazing well hidden for 7.9 % . very smooth . m- well carbonated but drying on the finish . d- i think i could drink a few of these if at home . a whole growler is certainly out of the picture but over 2 days , definitely possible . this might be my new goto brew being 5 mins away and so tasty/cheap . much better than i expected and true to style . cheers friends , scott

0.40 0.40 0.50 0.80 0.50	pours with a thin head that sticks around for less than a minute . almost no discernible odor , what i can pick up is grassy or vegetable-like . the taste of toasted malts and sweet caramel is very pleasant ... and very prominent , considering that it does n't smell like anything . nordeast seems thick for its style , it 's not something i would feel like drinking quickly- it 's more like a beer one would nurse .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	from a bottle labeled `` twisted merciless stout '' . no real reason to argue at all a - dark dark dark , some light manages to come through revealing an orangish/chocolatey undertone . tan head . there 's something indescribably beautiful about a stout in a pint glass s - a wallop of chocolate and dark roasted coffee , some malt and alcohol notes , but the smell of fermented hot chocolate rules the day t - same as the smell . an initial twinge of stout bitterness gives way to a heavy cocoa powder taste , followed by some slight alcohol notes , finally settling back into a nice chocolate finish . taste stays in your entire mouth forever . i can see the possibility of being turned off by the intensity of the cocoa flavor , but i 'm all for it myself m - while nothing unusual about the body , the mouth is left bathed in sticky flavor that lasts d - was n't too hard to finish this at all . delicious and enjoyable

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.80	a nice alternative to corona . its a bit sweeter than its conterpart , but still mixes well with a lime and a really hot day . on a 65 degree day ... this one loses some flair . it is an odd aroma , there is n't much there , but it smells a bit sour . it is drinkable since it is so light , not heavy or overcarbonated . just ok .

0.70 0.80 0.20 0.60 0.20	i do n't know what year this is . no pop whatsoever upon pulling the sad cork out . pours dark brown with maybe a trace of foam around the edges . the aroma is the only saving grace with this beer . it 's very bourbony with traces of molasses , maple , vanilla extract , and sharp alcohol . there is no way in hell i could drink a bottle of this flat , boozy , utter mess of a beer . the taste is packing some serious heat along with some of the aforementioned aromas coming through in the taste , but the mouthfeel flat out sucks and i ca n't believe the lost abbey is still letting stores sell this flat bourbon water . sorry , no good .

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.40 0.50	2010 batch @ harvest fest 10/1/11 a : golden body with fluffy white head and a good cling s : smells like it will be very good : lots of sour-adding oak , some noxious funk and tartness . t : definitely a let down . has a saison 's traditional legs , but not much additional funk and tartness that was suggested in the nose . also has a plastic quality in taste that carries a little to the mouthfeel that overpowers everything and is hard to get by . m : again with the plastic quality that is almost slightly cloying . the carbonation is spot on for a saison tho . o : i prefer arthur and arthur aged . the barrel treatment steered this in a direction i did n't like , maybe it was an off keg or sick stage . re-review on the docket with the new batch this winter .

0.50 0.70 0.40 0.40 0.40	pours a hazed golden color with no head . nose is lemon like with a lemongrass edge to it as well . flavor is slightly tart and leafy ( as in the leaves of plants ) . i usually dig flavored or spiced beers , but this is nasty . feel is thin like water and syrup mixed together . not drinkable . this could easily be the worst brew i have tasted in a long time ; on par with the infamous green chile beer i had in new mexico . avoid .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.60	had this on tap at papago last night . good looking beer served in a nonic pint glass . its dark , with a lightish off-white head , decent retention . aroma is a big mix of roasted grain , alcohol , malt sweetness , slightly burnt toast , coffee , chocolate , raisin , and cigar tobacco . unfortunately this did n't taste as good as it smelled . my expectations were raised by the aroma and then i felt a little left down as i did n't get the same complexity on my tongue . the roast , sweetness , and coffee and very prevalent , and so is the alcohol , more than it should be for a 6.5 % abv beer . i did n't know what the strength was when i was drinking it , and would 've guessed it was about 8.2 % if pressed for a number . mouthfeel was fine , relatively smooth , decent carbonation , etc . drinkability was ok , i guess could have a few of these if i was in the mood , but there are much better baltics out there , and at papago i quickly moved on to a scottish ale .

0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	opened this on wednesday night , a great breakup to the week . the cork was a bit hard to open , and when it did get popped it was like old faithful . i would say about one third of the bottle was foaming out of the top , it was a mess . the smell that filled the room was amazing and intoxicating . the appearance of this one was like a smoothie , it was a dark ruby red with the stickiest pink head . the head just sticks to the side of the glass , real foamy . it has an incredible amount of sediment , hop leaves , raspberry , seeds , and maybe even just yeast . once the cork was popped the smell that was released was heavenly . raspberry just fills the room , such a sweet fresh smell that gave me hope for the taste . i feel like the taste would of been best at the bottle release . the raspberry taste is great , and it is paired very well with the tart and sour aspects of this beer . its just a bit muddled , with the sourness a bit mellow . the mouthfeel leaves something left to be desired . it effects the flavors because it has a lot of floaties and 'distractions ' the sourness is good , but the gravity is so thick that 'syrup ' is the first thing that comes to mind . i could drink a full bottle to myself , but now that i have had a try of this i would not specifically seek this again . it is a good beer , just not a great lost abbey beer . i expect more from this brewery that i have expectations to do great things . j

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	12 oz bottle poured into a sprecher nonic . 6.7 % abv , 237102 , 231210 printed on the bottle stacked on the neck . a - heavy horse pours with a gorgeous bronzed ruby mahogany color with perfect clarity and is topped off by an incredible dense khaki head . great retention despite no carbonation bubbles through the beer and thick , swiss-cheese-like lace caked to the glass . perfection is appearance . s - heavy horse has a classic aroma of toasted malt with notes of caramel , toffee , and a pinch of nuttiness but is hindered by a dry , strong mineral finish . t - malt driven with very tasty toffee notes playing with gooey caramel and a dense breadiness . a lingering sweetness with underlying nuttiness is golden here . the mineral flavor barley comes through . m - medium-bodied and very smooth with a slick finish that 's only held back by a seemingly absent , ( in reality , it 's just low ) carbonation level . d - a slow starting but powerful horse this beer is , heavy horse certainly pulls it 's weight . tasty and absolutely gorgeous , it 's not a perfect brew , but it 's a treat of a scotch ale nonetheless .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50	this beer poured a cloudy golden color . it doesnt have much head no lacing . the smell is cereal/sweet/grainy like . the taste is mild and cereal like . it has a hint of sour apple flavor in it . the mouthfeel is thin . this is an interesting beer , but the flavors dont seem to meld in this particular brew . im intrigued , but not impressed .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	pours a reasonably-sized head . color is a clear amber , with an average amount of carbonation bubbling through . smell is absolutely pumpkin pie , down to the buttery crust and allspice . first sip is very bready , with a great thickness to it . pumpkin pie spice is felt throughout and makes it absolutely wonderful . absolutely amazing . going into this , i knew that southern tier made some great beers . i had no idea this would be one of their best ! try this beer . now !

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70	poured to a golden color with a slight orange tint and thin white head that dissipated quickly to little head or lacing . initial aroma of wheat dough and spices faded as beer warmed . mouthfeel was slightly tingly , yet not what i would expect from a white . unfortunately , the dough and spices in the initial nose were never present in the taste , and the finish was short and slightly stale . this beer started out better than it finished .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.40 0.40	pours thinner than expected with no head to speak of . blink and you might miss it . the smell is nice for this bourbon lover , but would be higher if it were n't so potent . the taste is one-dimensional , unbalanced , syrupy , and ( frankly ) pretty bad . there is nothing but bourbon from the front to the back of the palate , and it 's strong enough to leave you wanting something to balance . mouthfeel is decent for the style ( if a bit underwhelming ) , and i would not want to drink more than 1 of these . ever . in fact , i 'd rather drink 0 . very disappointing , and i will not be drinking this again .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70	pours a very clear and bright gold with a decent white head that retains and laces well . aroma is rather muted with some lemon and herbal hops being most dominant . some white bread and cooked veggies round out a rather unappealing aroma . taste is much better , but still lemon is most dominant . tropical fruits , pine , and fresh cut grass make an appearance not hinted at in the aroma and it is most welcome . white bread , biscuit , and toast add some malt to the flavors . citrus hops are the story , here though , and they are pretty tasty . mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a bit too much carbonation and just a touch of oil/resin left in the mouth with a bitter finish . drinks decently . taste far exceeds what the appearance and aroma promised , but does not quite wow me . i have had this beer quite a few times over the years , it just seems to be one that the competition has caught up with and surpassed .

1.00 0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90	for some reason i was expecting a more dark amber color than an almost black . do n't know why . this was a pleasant surprise . the deep deep brown indicated that this was going to be something more than i expected . the smell was typical for heavy beer of 12 % abv . lots of alcohol , but there was also that smokey palo santo wood smell that i love . wish it was more the wood , but the taste more than made up for it . the wooden and smokey front of the beer did not , as i was afraid of , turn into a sweet , alcohol burn in the back . the taste was hops and malt , blending together beautifully with the taste of palo santo wood . one of the best tasting beers i 've ever had . i know , a bold claim , but it ranks with alaskan smoked porter and my first taste of craft beer ( fat tire ) in terms of how excited i am about what i 'm drinking in the moment . smooth and slightly carbonated . a little bit of a bite at the back , but not much . overall , i 'd say this is my favorite beer out of dogfish head . i love their 90 minute , but this is just so unique and different .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	pony express original wheat pours a deep gold with a medium short-lived head with slight lacing . it 's aroma is almost nonexistent , with ( maybe ) a faint smell of corn ( ? ) . the flavor is light . actually , there is a pleasant balance of wheat , barley and corn , with a fairly dry finish . i think this is what the 'big 3 ' *wish* they could accomplish as the all american beer . carbonation is decent with nary an aftertaste . in summary , this is an excellent summer beer which is somewhat reminiscent of sam adams summer gold , way back when .

0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80	big thanks to gushue3 for this bottle ! pours nearly pitch black . medium tan head forms , 2 fingers , nice retention . aroma has bits of chocolate , roasted malts and bittersweet coffee notes . appears the coffee may be faded a bit . not really surprising given the age , but it 's still nice and pleasant . same kinda goes for the taste , though it is a bit more robust and a bit more sweet and definitely more chocolate . slight notes of just coffee beans , which is a good thing and definitely impressive . the feel is a nice surprise too . wonderfully full bodied , with a creamy texture . i think this has held up nicely . not as good as i 'm sure it was in the past , but very glad to have tried it !

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.60	12 oz bottle , capped poured in to a trappist glass a- saranac 's imp ipa pours a beautiful amber color , a very small off white head , steady rising carbonation and no floaties . s- good nose overall . very piney , lots of citrus , fresh hops , grapefruit skin , alcohol , and a definite malt structure . but a loud funk looms in this one ... t- spicy and tangy with a bitter finish . strong hop overtones dominate this imperial ipa as well as its alcohol content , some orange and a smoke character . m- a nice mouthfeel for an imp ipa . medium body and real bright tannin . the 8.5 % leaves for a nice finish . this one definitely gets beefy as it warms up . d- the funk on the nose really limits how many of these i would drink ...

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.80	pours clear yellow with a 2 inch cloudy white head ; smells of malt and yeast , with the malt odor dominating , but still very faint overall . tastes like a typical lager : malty , with grass , light yeast , light hops and some faint citrus or lemon . very thin and watery feel with a light champagne-like carbonation ; it 's very crisp and finishes dry . the malt finish borders on skunky , but the beer is very light and enjoyable . not exciting as far as taste goes , but very drinkable and easy to put down . could drink these all night , and i have done so when out at an italian restaurants . this beer goes nice with italian food , or maybe that 's just my perception since i 've had it so often over the years at a lot of italian restaurants . mixing with the italian food might also be elevating the score .

0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	decided to step out of my usual , had n't had an ipa in a long time . pours into my big-ass mug a cloudy high orange , takes forever to pour because it 's 60 % head at first . smell is a big burst of citrus-y hops , then something resembling wheat ( did n't expect that part ... ) . let 's take a swig ... definitely some hop strength going there , but it 's more in the sense of character than just straight-up bitterness . the citrusy background opens up more , kinda leans orange . goes down somewhat oily , though not in a ridiculous way . i was imagining more of a hoppy smack to the head and did n't get it . that 's good imo , does n't get caught up in a bitterness arms race like some of the style .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	poured from a bottle into a shipyard pumpkinhead pint glass . a : hazy , buttery golden orange with a minimal , lacey head . lots of cloud for a beer of this style . looks delicious . s : light citrus hop presence with notes of honey and salted butter . smells sweet and inviting . very light caramel malt in the nose . t : unfortunately , falls a little short of the smell , but that 's not saying too much bad here since i think this is probably the best smelling apa i 've ever put my nose in . very carbonated front with a significant piney hop bite . lots of rich malt in the finish , which is pretty short and that makes me happy . d : highly drinkable on a summer night . definitely a step up from anything `` macro . '' value : pricey . i paid $ 8.99 for a sixer . i 'm no cheapskate , but i think this beer would be more fairly priced at around $ 6.99 per sixer ... maybe it is up in new york .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	last beer from my sampler pack poured a light amber color with moderate white head . smell is slightly hoppy with a bread-like background . taste is excellent and pleasantly suprising . very refreshing with a bite at the finish . first class beer . my favorite from the sampler pack . glad i saved it until last .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	a - frankly , this is a little light to be an appearance-solid dipa , in my opinion . the color i 've come to expect from a dipa is mid to dark orange , and this is fairly pale yellow . there 's a bit of head off the pour , but it dissipates fairly quickly . s - from the first crack of this beer , the smell is great . fruits are in the forefront , with a bit of bitterness . great smell , i do n't think it gets a whole lot better than this . t - unfortunately , the taste is n't as great as the smell . the bitterness takes over powerfully in the taste , while the fruitiness is lacking . this is still a phenomenal tasting beer , but comparing it to the smell , it lacks a bit . m - mouthfeel is good , slightly syrupy and the bitterness fades at a good rate . overall , this beer is great . i 've had it several times and i have found that if you let it sit for a while , the bitterness dies out a bit , but the fruitiness goes with it .

0.40 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.50	the `` king of beers '' huh ? maybe one of the better american macro beers , but that 's not saying much . pours a very straw-like pale yellow with a small foamy head . smells of corn , rice , and very little malt . i can not smell a hop presence . maybe they put the hops in for 1 minute or 2 and then strain it out . taste of a very little amount of malt , mostly corny and whatever . very small amount of hops . this beer probably would n't be so bad it it had more hop bite to it .

0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.70	poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass : appearance and smell : poured a nice slightly hazy yellow gold with a farily small head white head which left a small collar and a bit of lacing on the edge of the glass . smelled really fresh . plenty of floral aroma and sweet citrus aroma present . taste and mouthfeel : tasted of peppery lemon , toast , and a bit citrus . not an abundance of malt in this one . some feint toffee like sweetness sneaks in here and there but mostly just plenty of hard hitting earthy hop bitterness . very filling for a brew of its stature mostly due to it being unfilitered as stated on the bottle . the part of the brew that really stood out to me was when it warms a bit the bitterness does n't cease to bite the tongue the instant it hits it . drinkability : definitely a tasty brew which sits in the gut more than the typical ipa . fairly unbalanced yet enjoyable due to its character , not much break from the bitterness in this one .

0.70 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.70	pours a dark golden copper color with dark ruby edges and a one finger yellowish beige head that quickly settles into a thick lasting ring . sporadic spots of lacing left behind . slightly spicy sweet malt aroma with hints of rye , caramel and toffee as well as faint spicy hops . medium bodied with a crisp , spicy hop presence up front that lingers over the sweet malts into a slightly dry finish . the hop character up front is spicy and only slightly bitter providing a nice dryness that compliments the sweeter notes . lots of sweet malt with hints of rye , caramel , toffee , nut and biscuit . really well balanced and quite quaffable .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.90 0.90	pourd deep copper colour with 1 finger white-ish head . smell - malts mostly , some dryed banana flavor as well . taste - really nice combination of malts and hops with slight bitterness . very balansed beer , very smooth and refreshing . it 's very drinkable too . taste a lot more impressive than smell , very well done !

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	this beer promised a lot , but did n't deliver . very clear golden yellow when served . it had a slight perfumey aroma which intrigued , but when i tried to follow it up when drinking , well , it was missing . my notes say : not much taste . the mouthfeel was good , low-medium , with a nice soft crispness . it was just ... not a lot of taste at all . would try to have again , see if i get a serving with some taste next time ; - )

0.40 0.60 0.30 0.20 0.20	appearance : kind of a dark reddish brown . very little head . clumps ( clots ? ) of yeast apparent . i love bottle-conditioned beers , particularly other quebec ones . this was not normal . smell : nothing particularly strong or memorable . or maybe i just forgot it because of the taste . taste : in this swine flu season , i 'm sure many of us have made the mistake of eating a finger food shortly after using an alcohol-based gel hand sanitizer . you can replicate much of the experience of this beer by doing that . mouthfeel : very light carbonation . seemed flat . drinkability : literally could not drink this . i had one sip from my glass , one sip from my drinking companion 's glass to see if something was wrong with mine ( perhaps i 'd inadvertently sanitized it , i thought , or perhaps it was the fault of the yeast chunks in mine - not so , unfortunately ) , and then could not drink any more . my drinking companion finished the bottle out of a desire not to waste it and is currently regretting it .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.50	red stripe lager pours a stiff head over a clear yellow brew . carbonation is extremely active , the nose is slightly sour and oily , almost , and also of rice and lager yeast . the flavor is slightly sweet corn and rice , with a sort of boiled vegetable hop kind of thing balancing it . a really strange off flavor . mouthfeel is crisp and surprisingly full considering all those bubbles- also there's something cloying that coated the inside of my mouth . not exactly the most unpleasant brew i 've had , but there 's something wrong about it . wierd . the bottles are awesome though . almost perfect , really .

0.90 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.80	pours an impeccably clear tawny gold hue . creamy two and a half finger head showing good retention and sticky patches of lacing . clean nose , some dextrinous aromas and faint noble hops.sweet pale malt and toasty vienna upfront , followed by some nutty victory malt and a mild floral hallertau flavor . flavor really drops off in the aftertaste , just some bland bitterness ; simple but balanced . light-medium body and medium carbonation- again nothing special but its a solid mouthfeel . finishes clean and drinkable without any residual flavor . this seems like yet another faux-lager fermented with ale yeast ; but harpoon is good at doing that .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	appearance : turbid orange with tons of floaties and sediment . not actually an attractive beer , but the head retention is excellent ( no lace whatsoever though ) . smell : heavy on the caramel and vanilla with some fruity undertones . alcohol is present as well , providing a bit of sting . taste & mouthfeel : fruit ( apple and pear ) , mild caramel sweetness and plenty of oaky notes . medium-bodied with fine champagne-like carbonation . the finish is dry and boozy as hell , making me wonder how harsh this stuff must 've been before it was aged . after half a glass the alcohol really starts to take over the palate , drowning out the rest of the flavors . quite a letdown from the pleasant aroma . notes : gets a little better as it warms , but the astringent alcohol flavor makes this mediocre at best .

0.60 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90	on the back of a questionaire at the great lakes brewpub : a- brownish gold in color , begins with a two finger head but receeds to a film due to what is most likely a dirty glass . lacing also not very great due to the glass . s- floral and citrus , with some malt backbone under the hops-caramel . i perceive an overall sanitizer/cleanser aroma overall though , pretty much hides the aroma of the brew . t- floral hop flavor followed by a malt character which balances it out . in turn the malt flavor is followed by a lingering floral/citrus bitterness . the beer is creamy in the mouth and has overall lower carbonation levels . it 's got a medium-heavy body . this is an ipa i 'll definitely buy again , i look forward to next spring/summer when it 'll become part of the regular lineup ... according to the website . could drink it all night and would make a good session brew but for the 8 % abv .

0.70 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.60	served in a shaker pint glass at the green turtle in the baltimore airport . appearance : clear coppery-orange color with a very thin white foam across the top . some strands of lacing here and there , but not a lot . smell : grainy with a cut grass smell when cold - and almost no smell at all when warm . taste : this beer is much better when warmed up and served with food . cold and alone the beer is chalky with a grainy lager flavor . warmed up and with food the malt comes out more . the beer with food and warmed up has a solid malt flavor in the front , followed by a mild bitter hop finish . mouthfeel : good carbonation and maybe a bit sticky . not at all watery and definitely above average . drinkability : by itself i really do n't care for this beer . it 's got a flavor profile that just leaves me cold - i 'm not caring for it . with food it becomes much better in washing a meal down and i think then the flavors compliment things more . overall a `` meh '' experience .

0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40 0.40	what 's the best way to describe bud light . how about someone pissing in a can , diluting that piss with seltzer water , adding a dash of hops , and then `` cold-filtering '' said piss/hopwater . this is one of the most unappetizing beers i have had , although it 's palatable when compared to it 's inbred cousin : bud light lime .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.60 0.50	bought at berkeley bowl in berkeley , ca a : hazy , unfiltered apple cider . small creamy white head . s : peachy , cooked strawberries , hops . sweetish and beautiful . t : unfortunately , the alcohol flavor jumps to the front , and while it 's not quite overwhelming , it 's a large part of the flavor , which i do n't find pleasant . but what 's to the side of it , and behind it is quite nice . hoppy , not very bitter . but the ratio of alcohol really hurts it for me . if that flavor was hidden more , and the others more emphasized , i would like it a lot better . m : soft , micro carbonation , but again the alcohol ratio leaves an unpleasant feeling . d : it 's not for me for the said reasons , but i can see why others find it great .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	dark , almost black , but with a fair amount of brown edges . light mocha head , close to a finger , with loads of spiderweb lacing . smell is huge with roasted coffee . pleasant cocoa and toasted , roasted malts fill the ending of the nose . it was quite amazing . nice bitter coffee notes , with more chocolate notes and sweet malts than with the aroma . overall feel is good enough , but was a bit thin . this was smelling great , drinking good and going down easy .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	thanks to pwoods for this awesome extra . absolutely love the name ... `` enter the beagle '' , as a dog guy , ca n't get enough when i see beer and dog stuff together . pours with a huge billowy head on a murky orange body . the head really has some large pillows in it and it just sits high the whole way down ... one of the more impressive looking pale ales ive experienced . the nose is very very subtle ; biscuity malt , pine and citrus , but very subdued , i had to stick my nose down in it for a minute to really draw everything out . very faint . diving in the mouthfeel is creamy and soft , very much like a casked ipa would be . there is a nice citrus , think orange and grapfruit rind , hop flavor rounded out on the back end by some toasted bread from the malts . some orangemarmalade and toast comes to mind when sipping on this . i 'd describe this as a citrusy english pale ale , unique considering how most american ipas taste , but nevertheless , this is a very good english/american ipa . will keep my eye on what listermann puts out in the future , this was a very good start

0.70 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.50	i lied in my last review when i stated i was finally done with oktoberfests this season , somehow this bottle landed in my lap so i ought to review it . pours a lot more reddish than most oktoberfests , with a big dirty white head . smell is typical but with a hint of toecheese . the smell is awful for an oktoberfest this is one freaky tasting oktoberfest , hops are there but it is ultra fruity and metallic . one of the worst oktoberfests i have tasted .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	poured into a pint glass . a : white nose with a light blonde body , light in color that hints at the english side of this ipa . good head retention and small bit of lacing . s : slightly disappointed with the aroma , for an ipa this is a bit weak in this section . t : nice taste , subtle english notes from the yeast , but not overpowering like other english ipas . good clean , refreshing lemon , earthy hop taste . slight malt finish . m : a slightly lighter looking ipa , shows for a good silky mouthfeel . d : not heavy and not light but a good balance , this is one that i would choose as a crowd pleaser and could use it as a session beer as well .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80	batch 7800 , bottled 1-31-2007 . opened and reviewed 12-3-11 bottle was wax dipped upon purchase in 2007 aroma- tons of fig and raison , oxidation ( wet paper , musty ) taste- heavy fig and raison , just like the nose . no hop presence . very malty , bordering on sweet flavor . big notes of oxidation , but it works well with the dark caramel body . light plum and some dried apricot come through as well . overall- this almost 5 year old beer has held up awesome . one of the best barleywines i 've ever had . love the play of oxidation on this one . if the body were lighter , the wet paper flavors would have nothing to bounce off of . beautiful .

0.80 1.00 1.00 0.70 1.00	it poured a crystal amber . it had a nice three finger head . the head was slightly off white . it had a nice malt , and floral hop scent . it had a strong bitter hop taste on the front-end . then a nice malt sweetness grew . and it finished with the bitter hop taste in the back-end . it had a perfect lite-to-medium body . a very drinkable beer . it had several good qualities that made it enjoyable . if it were less expensive i could drink this as a session beer .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60 0.70	bottle from whole foods , charlottesville , va . poured into a blue mountain brewery-logoed pint glass . appearance : a rather aggressive pour yields a huge two-finger white fluffy head with awesome retention . extremely fine , fast , and dense carbonation falls upwards towards it . it 's a friggin ' reverse waterfall . pale golden body that 's slightly hazy . color seems a bit light , but other than that , spot on . aroma : pale malty grain , light , vegetal hoppiness with a little tart citrus ( lemon ) in play . kinda mild . smells grassy in places , almost dry hopped . taste : more pale malt here , slight vegetal `` dry-hop '' flavor sneaks through , citrus , the slightest hint of roasty butterscotch goodness , and a mild bitterness . seems sorta shallow in places . mouthfeel : thin , but smooth and even . light bodied . drinkability : decent , cold use a few more complexities in the mouth and nose , particularly in the malt bill .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	rated from a 12 oz bottle . a : straw-like golden color . very carbonated ( almost too much ) which resulted in a massive but artifical head . s : pungent raspberry tones that really wet the appetite . a hint of wheat in the background . t/m : very smooth wheat beer with a very weak ( and therefore disappointing ) raspberry flavor . d : overall , a very easy brew to drink - would be great on a hot summer day .

0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.80	12 oz bottle from sam adams holiday collection very good winter warmer . the appearance was nearly opaque . i was n't impressed with the head , then again i am not quite sure what a head on this type of beer is supposed to be like . i got very little from the initial smell of the beer . later on , however , i was able to detect the spices particularly the ginger . the taste was pretty good and it was evolving . at first i got a dark roasted toffee taste on the sides of my tounge with a slight lingering aftertaste that was indicative of acidic coffee ( i mean this a positive ) . then the spices began to dance on the tip of my tounge . very nice indeed . pairing : i would put this beer with chocolate or even some good banana or pumpkin bread . not so much with a meal . this is a nice fireside beer . i enjoyed this beer enough to hope that sam would offer this as more then just a side in its holiday collection . this is n't quite a gl christmas ale , but it sure is a close second .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.90	good for a wheat beer . not really a belgian wheat as it is portrayed . it 's not even close to the quality of a celis white ( in the belgian wheat class ) . appearance was the worst part . expecting a belgian wheat , but got a kristall weizen appearance . everything else about it was good .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.30 0.30	had this brew on tap last evening , brew was poured to a amber color with a extraordinary active head that left a good 2 + inch head flowing up out of the glass . the aroma was mostly of malt , caramel and a spiciness that i am not sure if i liked . this surprised me but i did not like the taste of this brew and actually could not finish it after a while as it warmed up . i was able to pick up the malt taste but what became more and more prevalent as it warmed up was a metallic taste that started to dominate in a very bad way . i usually will not let a beer go unfinished but this one was just not good . i wonder if my taste buds where off a bit last evening since i see that this beer has gotten pretty ok reviews in the past .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.60	12oz bottle - & gt ; goblet code : 7670 - & gt ; website - & gt ; packaged 9.26.06 pours a light copper with a generous off white almost tan head , that leaves sporadicly thick lace . carbonation appears high on the pour . nose : kinda of a spicey yeasty smell along with some faint malts . taste : some sweet malt flavor along with a little nuttiness and spice on the finish with just a tad of bitterness . mouthfeel is thin and the carbonation seems a little excessive . not the best brown ale i 've ever had , but not the worst either , i prefer a fuller malt presense .

0.70 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70	nose : boozy . a little fruit . no real hops to speak of in this one . the rocket seems empty . appearance : hazy honey-orange with a small , but persistent , cream-colored head . taste : mostly sweet . but the hops come in toward the end . earthy and peppery . pleasant and mild . not unique , but not a common tasting beer . nice and juicy , but the sweetness and hot gums from the alcohol keep this from being better . overall : pretty good as a beer . not great as a double ipa .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	750ml into a tulip . pours an uninspired murky dark walnut , minor tan head was slow to recede , minor lacing . incredibly complex aroma , a deep strong dark with dirt , sour grass , tart apple , a cornucopia of spices . the complexity resides in the high notes . the flavor is chaotic . the tart and sour while in the forefront are mild , they sit atop a traditional strong dark . the aftertaste lingers long and evolves significantly . warmth accentuates the sharp dryness in the finish . perfect touch of the rustic . medium bodied lively mouthfeel . i understand what the other reviewers have written , both in praise and condemnation , this is a polarizing brew . unique cheers jd

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.80	batch 671 brewed almost exactly one year ago ( 11-11-10 ) a : cloudy straw , literally the thickest , tallest head i 've ever seen , it filled an entire wine tulip , leaving behind thick soapy lace clinging to the sides . s : nice fresh farmhouse funk and intense peaches , lemon zest , apples . t : brief splash of sourness , then it settles into soft peachy tones and bitter finish m : light-bodied , watery , very dry finish . o : kind of a strange beer , the nose suggests a much stronger sour but it 's actually a little watery and the flavors are quite subdued .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured nicely with large carmel head , leaves some lacing . color was deep amber to a brown smell was that of coffee and also a mild hop smell . taste was very good , it seemed a little light on carbonation to me . mouthfeel was clean and lighter than i would have thought from this beer , i could easily drink a few of these a day

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90	6 pack , fresh from the fridge at new england beverage . poured in my celebrator glass . looks pretty tasty . smells a lot like the mai-ur-bock , which is n't surprising . lighter than expected for a dunkel , this one 's a stunningly clear amber . i had to ease back on the pour to keep the foamy , tan head from going over the edge of the glass , and it thins out pretty quickly . lacing is disappearing as i type this , so i may as well give it a go . taste is dominated by a slightly nutty , caramel maltiness . a tiny bit of oxidized twangy tartness is apparent moreso in the smell than the taste , but it 's not really that 'off ' and again , is very similar to the same part of the flavor profile of the mai-ur-bock . finish is crisp , clean very refreshing . i think i like this one more than the mai-ur-bock . it 's a little cleaner on the palate and not as biting . with dunkel in the name , it could probably stand to be a little bit darker . seems like it could make for a nice session brew .

0.70 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.90	shared out of 22oz bottle . nice hoppy and bitterness in a red ale and in line with my palette . not sweet , not overpowering . a tates that could be enjoyed for tasting or throwing back a six . a find that most of these flying fish beers are good . this is one of them .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	this is the 12oz offering , as opposed to the usual 22oz bombers , which i 've found over the past few years to be the best example of american iipas available in my part of the world . the alcohol has been increased in this edition ( to 8.4 % from 7.5 % ) , and the humorous murmurings on the label modified as well . this pours a nice clear copper hue , with a billowy white head , that sticks around for quite some time , leaving a small amount of lacing . the smell is lovely grapefruit essence from the hops , and a small malt offset ; what an anticipatory aroma ! the flavour is quite full of bitter , astringent pine hops , more so than the aroma would have indicated . the malt influence is quite mild ; this is all about the hops , which i 've come to learn is n't always a grand thing . the sweetness from properly balanced malt is a necessity in an ipa or iipa . this beer is n't bad by any stretch of the imagination ; the elevated alcohol may also contribute to the bitterness . when looking for a palate cleanser , with a whole lot of real hop goodness , look no further than this .

0.40 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40	another sahti in helsinki poured from a jug in the back of the bar . entered as a cask serving unless this can be verified . had this one at villi waino in helsinki . from notes . a - hazy dark brown pour . no visible carbonation and a ring of bubbles on the top . no retention obviously since there was no head . s - woody with berries and forest aromas . medicinal and earthy . i also get a sort of hospital sanitation aroma . i always think sahti smells very interesting and inviting as well as completely authentic . t - quite mild . all the same elements as the aroma with berries , woods , medicinal notes , and earthiness . a bit of a sour finish and more berries . all those elements were present , but in a tame form . m - light to medium body leaning towards lighter end . feels a little light , almost watery . painful lingering medicinal sweetness in the finish . o/d - not a great one by any means . mouthfeel is weird and too light . seems like it should be a little syrupy but it comes as watery . taste is too mild imo . would n't seek it out at all and probably not a good example of the style .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	poured into portsmouth snifter pours 1 finger of white head . decent retention . leaves a little bit of splattered lace . color is a pale straw yellow . aroma : big lemon citrus flavor . it also has a nice farmhouse funk to it . earthy and herbal . some spice . lovin the funk here . taste : pepper and spice . some lemon zest . yeast flavors . it has some cloves and banana flavors in the finish . not as funky as the nose , but it still has some barnyard flavors to it . it has a slight apple flavor to it , but it is fairly hidden . mouthfeel : funky and fizzy . lighter bodied with a medium amount of carbonation . ends kind of dry . overall , a decent saison . decently drinkable . i really enjoyed the funk in the nose . i wish it was more present in the taste . not bad .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90	pours a slightly hazy , very light tan . nice off white head that manages to stick around . not too much in the way of the aroma department , kind of dissapointing . quick burst of hoppy ? fruitiness followed by a citrusy bitter finish . a nice ipa , not over the top and a quite a good session brew . interesting flavor ... not a carbon copy of the standard west coast ipa . worthy .

0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.60	slightly cloudy copper with a thin lace of white on top . beautiful floral hop aroma ... with maybe a touch of spice . taste is slightly one dimesional ... very hoppy with an oily bitter finish . a touch of malt , but not really enough to balance this one out . it has a medium body , and prickly carbonation . overall , a decent ipa , but not one i 'd go out of my way for .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	aroma : coffee and chocolate malt meld accented by a whiff of hops and a touch of smoke . nice complexity and balance leads to a very appealing invitation . appearance : black glass shows a thin brown edge when tilted and sports a coffee colored head that leaves tide marks like rings of coffee left too long in the mug . flavor : given all the build up , a bit of a let down in the taste . flavor is a bit mild compared to the aroma with the hops peeking out a bit more and a touch of lactose coming out . mouthfeel : heavy body , creamy texture and a dry finish . overall impression : thick and creamy with a wonderful nose . unfortunately the taste just didnt live up to the billing . still , a very enjoyable stout .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80	pours from a 22oz . bottle with a different label than pictured here . states that it 's triple hoppy . it has a slightly hazy golden orange color with lots of rocky head . aroma is excellent . it 's full of fresh hops , citrus and pine . certainly a lot of dry hopping going on here . taste is more of the same . a tastebud killer of an iipa . tons of hoppy bitterness but then somehow ( somewhat ) balanced out with a touch of sweetness . mouthfeel is a little thin but a good level of carbonation . drinkability is what it can be when it 's over 9 % . overall a very well done imperial ipa . i 'll be looking for this one again . thanks to the kind lady who works at liquor max in loveland , co for recommending this one . she said her husband loved it and i can see why !

0.70 0.90 0.40 0.80 0.60	fruity nose classic ipa ( not the barleywine as is sometimes said ) . dark bronze color . we can see especially the mango into the nostrils . at the entrance in the mouth , the taste is special , especially for a beer of this style , it looks a little alcohol fishing just before and before all , grate the mouth . soon , we find the fruity hops ( slightly outdated ) and bitterness , in great power , comes tickle the taste buds . however , for many ibu beer , it 's still quite low and almost entirely a commercial low-level process that make reference to sell beer . aside from that , the drink is good .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	dark brown sort of coppery in color with a thin head . the head is sort of creamy and sticks to the glass on the way down . it smells lightly malty with a stronger almost fruity floral smell like a wine of some sort . alcohol smells is also apparent . based on its appearance and smell i thought there would be a bit more to the taste of this beer . its quite floral and contains little bitterness . mouthfeel is pretty smooth and it goes down quite easily . drinkability is decent .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.60	new tradition starting tonight , 40 ounce thursdays . for the following several months , every thursday possible , i will review beers served in 40 ounce bottles or beers that are on the `` bottom of the barrel list '' ... tonight i 'm starting with a shining star of the malt liquor world ... in a distant third place haffenreffer ! by pabst . beer poured from the 40 into a half liter glass . beer is yellow and clear and heavily carbonated . forms a pretty thick head that leaves some lacing on the glass . neat . the carbonation is really big bubbles that rise quickly through the beer . makes the beer appear pretty thin , which i suppose is accurate . looks fine . you wo n't believe me but it kind of smells like a bar of soap . shit , i have to drink this whole thing ? damn it . it tastes like nothing at first , then really sweet , then like boiled corn . d'oh ! beer is thin and there is surprisingly little carbonation on the palate . there is no real bitterness but there is an aftertaste that grows . it gets better the more i drink but its not going to get to `` good '' anytime soon . as far as malt liquor is concerned ... .eh , i guess i 'll develop a palate for them over the coming months . i drank the whole thing , this beer eventually started to dry my mouth out .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	thanks presario . a rice beer with brown malts . pours grapefruit colour with lotsa white head . a distinct barnyard , but not much of that in the taste . leaves a lot of lace , the carbonation is there and it is drinkable this beer . not a ot of mouthfeel .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80	pours a dark amber reddish color that just seems really good for this time of year . had a small 1-finger light head that fell rather quickly leaving no signs of lacing on the glass . lots of carbonation bubbles present . the smell was a little bit malty and yeasty , but it was a very faint smell all in all . the taste was crisp and dry . floral hops were present , but did n't stand out a whole lot . not a very complex tasting beer . the mouthfeel was good on this . lighter body with a medium to high carbonation that went down smooth . i 'd say the drinkability was good . these are pretty easy to drink beers , especially for this time of year where it 's just starting to get a little colder outside . i 'd say its a great beer to have for when its starting to get colder , but it 's not quite stout season yet . this is the first beer i 've had from brooklyn brewery , and i am definitely interested to see what other beers they have out there . cheers .

0.60 0.40 1.00 1.00 1.00	i never understood how a beer could be `` chewy '' until i tried golden cap and there it was , `` chewy . '' this saison is made with spelt - i have no idea what difference that makes but i thought it was neat . not as yeasty as other saisons . it manages to be a complex of flavors ; peppery , citrusy ( is `` citrusy '' a word ? ) , with just a tang of bitter that delivers without punishment . lots of bubbles that melt quickly , creating a sparkle on the tongue and a smooth swallow with no burping later .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.70	on-tap @ the publick house in brookline , ma . pours an opaque black color with a small tan head . this might come as a shock , but this beer actually smells like real chocolate ! if you blindfolded me and put the beer and a chocolate bar in front me , i would be hard-pressed to tell which one was which . the taste is great as well , but i did not receive the chocolate rush that i did from the aroma . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy . slightly bitter from the use of hops brings the drinkabikity down a bit , but it 's still great for a stout . this beer was a treat to have on tap and left me feeling very satisfied .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	good light straw color , good quality foam with good laces . smells faintly of hay and lemons . the taste is of a light malt and grain with a bitter but clean aftertaste , but not too strongly hopped . this beer is full bodied , creamy , and well carbonated . you could quaff this for a long time . very good beer . i wonder if this is n't like what macrolager would be like without the adjuncts .

0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.70	keo is a mild lager . cold filtering normally equates to flavor-removal . the straw to gold color is clear and clean . there 's virtually no aroma besides the hops and that leaves in a hurry . the thin malt body can be noticed with an amount of concentration . the metallic and lightly citrus hops are the star of the show for this brew . pretty white head with fine tiny bubbles . keep in mind , this is a beer brewed for a hot sunny climate

0.60 0.60 0.60 0.20 0.40	poured from a bottle into a willy and poured another just to be sure in my sam adams pint glass . let me start this review by saying i dont fail beers often i take style in mind and try to be fair but this one i 'm giving the grade i belive it earned . a-very hazy yellow alot of yeast at the bottom of the bottle s-bannana and grain t-here is where you lose me 100 % this is in no way a winter beer and i would not even classify it as a wibier it tastes thru and thru like your average run of the mill american wheat . no spice no warmer nothing . m-medium body good carbonation level goes down easy . d-would never buy this again i stopped drinking wheats long ago and have no reason to pay 13 bucks for one .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	a : clear , deep amber/copper . decent off-white head and moderate lacing . s : mild spices , hops and malt . t & m : rough feel up front . mildly sweet . some hops that fade slightly bitter . chewy maltiness to round things out . nothing special about this beer . it 's good but nothing i 'd go out of my way to purchase again .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.70	2006 vintage . a : very dark with a somewhat thick head . not huge but more than usual for this style of beer . poured thick like used motor oil . s : smell of sweet roasted malts . t : roasted malts with a slight sweetness . very slight alcohol taste , not much burn either . m : thick chewy and sticky . d : i feel this beer is a small step above avaerage . good beer but in no way worth the price of 17 $ for 750ml . many better ris available for much less $ $ .

0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90 1.00	a good man by the name of corey sent this my way . this with a tasty variety of ng offerings were in a beautiful box . notes taken from last weekend while enjoying it with some ostrich on the grill . bottle graphics : 9/10 . pure class . a : hazy yellow body , looks delicious . the head forms pillow bunches like the clouds on the simpsons . s : wheaty aromas . spices and sweetness , nothing standout or what i would think would lead me to the dynamic tastes . t : almost as good as the crack 'd wheat and that my friends is saying a lot . the banana and yeast flavors are much more present and the bitterness lays low . just a personal style thing . bananas and wheat usually prevalant in lesser versions of this style leave me bored but this showcases all the fine aspects of flavor . m : texturally perfect . not much carbonation but just thick enough with some pillowiness . walks the fine line of a good hefe being refreshing yet creamy . d : i would never pencil this in north of 5 % abv . this beer was designed for sitting and sipping at the grill in a good hefe glass . i am not a hefeweizen lover , but i love this beer and appreciate it for what it is . this is a tremendous beer . new glarus is something i would not have known of if not for trading and traders like maximum12 . this is a top top notch brewery .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured from a bottle . beautiful golden brown with a hint of red . thick foam that stays the whole time and coats the sides of the glass . not too much of a smell . light hops and a hint of allspice . i really love this beer . the spice flavor is n't too obvious or strong , very subtle and i only noticed some nutmeg and allspice in the aftertaste . very nice with a perfect amount of bitterness . this has become one of my favorite winter beers .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.30 0.40	this beer pours a beautiful deep brown with a reddish tint to it . the smell was pleasant with a sort of spiced cherry aroma coming through , however i was not very impressed with the carbonation which seemed to be low . the taste for me was pretty overwhelmingly sweet , no apparent sourness to better balance the flavors out . you can taste some of the roasted malts but other then that pretty bland with a cherry-banana sweetness coming through that makes it pretty hard to drink , definitely a sipping beer . overall i did n't care for it much

0.80 1.00 1.00 0.80 0.90	black and grey 22 oz . bomber bottle with a wrap around silk screened label . the main picture is that of 4 dark chocolate squares stamped with the southern tier symbol . to the right of the picture is a snifter with the proper serving temp , the mayan symbol for chocolate , the beer 's specifications , ingredients , and 3 lengthy paragraphs . the frist two paragraphs talk about the histoy of chocolate from it 's humble start with the mayans and how it was made popular by louis xiv . the last one talks about how well chocolate works with southern tier and that this beer is part of their black water series . like every other southern tier big beer bottle , the only thing missing is a date of some sort . a vintage year would be sufficient . appearance : i followed southern tier 's suggestion and poured this beer into a snifter . i do n't have a southern tier snifter , so i poured it into `` maudite '' snifter . when it was poured , this beer actually looks like they melted down chocolate . not a milk chocolate , but one of those dark chcoclate bars that are from 90 % to 100 % cocoa beans . the color of this beer was absolutely great , but the head of foam was less to be desired . i guess chocolate should n't have a head of foam on it . the head of foam was about 1/2 inch in height and a dark tan/mocha color . it would have been nice if the head of foam did n't quickly dissipate into just a handful of tan/mocha rings . no streaks of lace or even spots of lace . at least the beer had it 's color going for it ! smell : it would be an under statement if i just said that this beer smelled like chocolate . it smelled exactly like they melted down quite a few 90 % to 100 % cocoa bean chocolate bars . there were many different types of chocolate in the aroma . there was belgian chocolate , bitter dark chocolate , a hint of milk chocolate , and rich chocolate malts . it would smell exactly like a chocolate milkshake if it was n't for the subtle touch of roasted barley flakes that was hiding in the background . there was no other new aroma after the barley flakes . i do n't see how any aroma could get pass the excessive chocolate aroma . a pleasure to smell ! i could n't get enough of this chocolately aroma . taste : was this beer sweet , at first . not only was the first taste a form of sweet milk chocolate , but there was plenty of candy sugar riding along with the chocolate . after the appearance and aroma , i thought that this beer was going to taste like chocolate all the way , but the candy sugar said `` nope ! '' after the candy sugar the taste goes slightly bitter with bitter dark chocolate , belgain chocolate , chocolate malts , a hint of roasted barley flakes , a tiny touch of bitter roasted hops , a splash of alcohol , and this this sweet chocolately beer finishes up with more candy sugar . it would have been to nice have a beer that tasted just like chocolate , but it was also nice to see the chocolate let out a few more flavors from the back . sometimes it got too sweet , but it 's still a great beer to drink . mouthfeel : it was a full bodied beer , but it just barely made over the medium bodied border . it featured a chocolately and slightly bitter aftertasteof candy sugar , bitter dark chocolate , belgian chocolate , and chocolate malts . this chocolately aftertaste will stick around in your mouth for a few seconds . my bottle says this has a 11 % abv . are they kidding ? there 's no way it was that high . if i had to guess the abv % , i would say somewhere in the 8 % to 9 % . drinkability : boy is this beer sweet ! i use the term `` sweet '' in a good way and as reference to the beer itself . this beer can get a bit on the sweet side , but it 's a frickin ' chocolate beer . it has to be sweet ! if you like chocolate and who does n't , then you need to wrap your lips around this sweet treat ! it would be a pleasure to drink this beer once again .

0.80 0.50 0.90 0.90 0.70	chilled bottle into a glass . an extra courtesy of chcfan . many thanks , chris . a : pours a deep copper color with amber highlights . lazy carbonation when held to the light . head is a fluffy 2 fingers , but it recedes into a halo with some film on the top . lacing is ample and generous . s : pine hop bomb at first ... mouth-watering in its pungency . grass . citrus ( lemon ) . then a floral and cinnamon spice aroma that -- and i apologize for saying this -- reminds me of urinal cakes . i had that association last year , and i 'm still unable to break it . t : green pine-needle hops buoyed by faint grass and a substantial citric flavor . floral hops in the mid-taste with light cinnamon . caramel and chocolate malt manifest and become more apparent near the finish . there are a couple of imperial reds i enjoy more than this , but there 's no questioning that this is a beer of high caliber . m : medium-bodied with good carbonation for an amber ale . well-masked abv . d : this is solid , make no mistake ; but the smell association is just a problem for me . i would recommend this beer highly to others ( as most do n't seem to have the same association i do ) , but it 's not for me .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	i had not heard of this kristalweizen style before , so i thought i was reviewing a straight wheat , but here goes . diluted apple juice colored body with no head even after a vigorous straight down the middle pour . no lacing . very very clear . aroma is really hefty considering the low abv and general weakness of the flavor . there 's a great bit of bready yeast and a big malted wheat aroma . exactly what you would expect . the taste is very weak . cold it 's next to nothing but when it warms the wheat shines , though none of the yeast characteristics , but apparently they are not supposed to be prevelant for this 'style ' . definitely drinkable as the low abv and diluted flavor seem to be meant for chugging after a lawnmowing session . mouhtfeel reminds me of a flat macro lager . low carbonation , thin , watery , not drying or clinging . just not a whole lot there ; but that seems to be in accordance again with this style i 've never heard of . all in all , tastier than a macro , but do n't expect a full flavored wheat beer even though the label says that 's what it is . this beer is meant for drinking quickly . maybe this would actually be one to put some fruit in just to liven it up .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.40	bottle # 1079 , purchased at liquor world in cambridge for something close to $ 9 . shared with the last couple of troopers in queens saturday night . poured into my yard 's mug . rich , robust , coffee creamer-colored head . black/brown oiled body . smells of burning hot chocolate , mineral oil , & newspaper ink . taste is stiff with whiskey . oak & charcoal try to back it up , but it all falls flat after just a little peated grain show up . very bland overall . sticky , almost gooey texture . though not as pleasant as it sounds . thick & minimally carbed . a very iffy beer that i was really looking forward to . : |

0.40 0.40 0.40 0.70 0.90	the aroma is watery and slightly sweet with a hint of latex . the appearance is light pale gold with a small head . the flavor is sweet and malty with a hint of bitterness but it 's mostly watery . the palate is like water . this is basically a beer flavored water but very refreshing and easy to drink . as a low calorie beer it 's better than the competition .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	a - pitch black with a carbonated type head that fades quickly s - fruity , chocolatey , roasty , and malty t - huge dried fruit on the forefront followed by massive chocolate and roasty accompaniment . warming alcohol as well , leaves a huge roasty aftertaste m - medium-high carbonation and full in body , but only a medium mouthfeel . d - definitely a sipper . different then most ris , but a pretty good example .

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.30 0.20	purchased single bottle from martignetti's appearance = decent looking foggy , murky dark orange-brown-peach colord . not much head at all . pretty good lacing . smell = lots of alcohol and zest . a candy like sweetness , smell almost exaclty like strawberry twizzlers . intesesting scent . taste = too sweet and syrupy with the alcohol packing quite a punch to boot . an overwhelming taste that does n't agree with me , just a bit too harsh and sweet . it could be balanced better . more bitter and more of a hops presence . i like the thick , syrupy mouthfeel as it 's quite comforting but the taste gets old fast and just is n't complex . this could really be improved . overall = i do n't have much experience with barley wines . this one is n't recommended and i 'd never try it again as it 's too overwhelming and there 's many other extreme beers i 'd chose over this .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.20	pours clear bright gold with a huge 2+ finger fizzy whit head that faded to a film and left no lacing smell is sa noble pils with more malt and booze taste - noble hops fruity yeast/malt i get buttery malt and lots of grainy malts that make this beer very sweet mouthfeel is medium/heavy ? and sticky drinkability is terrible - sa suckered me again - $ 18 a pop - for a heavier version noble pils i will pass on picking up another bottle

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	my `` go to '' beer store normally does n't have any of stone brewing companies products but i saw a few cases of this stuff sitting on a cart and i took it upon my self to do a little downstocking . anyway as i poured the brew in my pint glass i got the full floral aroma before i even put my nose to the edge of the glass . it 's almost like a pine tree just fell on top of me . the appearance was nice as well glowing a nice amber/orangey hue thru the glass . if you like hops this is the beer for you . not over done in anyway but like another review said the 100 ibu 's is slightly questionable . i was expecting my tongue to just fall off from the bitterness but that was n't the case . ruination ipa is a very drinkable beer and i will definately be partaking in some more very soon .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80	the infamous hellshire i . thanks for the trade , dale . a : the pour is a cloudy amber color with pretty minimal head formation . s : smells really good . lots of bourbon , vanilla , oak right away , giving a huge barrel presence . the barleywine aromas of caramel , toffee , brown sugar , and dark fruits are evident and impressive as well . t : the flavor just really falls short . toffee , nut shells , and wood dominate the flavor . there is a bit of vanilla and some mild bourbon , but the oak and booze are just overpowering . it really lacks refinement , cohesion , and balance . m : the body is medium with low to medium carbonation . o : a really nice nose but the flavor was disappointing .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.70 0.70	poured into my infamous mason jar . the smell hit me as i poured - which is pretty impressive in and of itself . smell is of cocoa beans , warm milk , and pepper . this is good . the aftertaste is slightly astringent alcohol and more choco . there 's a small fig presence and a dry finish . this is good , but it 's a little overrated here . i always have a tough time with porters because i still have n't found one as good as my old staple , great lakes edmund fitzgerald porter ... went down fast . just a touch too dry and a touch too much alcohol presence for me in this style . 5.7 is 5.7 , but you might think this was more like 6.2 in the flavor - it 's just not as smooth as some other porter options . it 's tasty and it smells fantastic . i know real porters have sour ale , but usually that sour ale adds creaminess , here it almost has a coors light sourness ( acrid-overdrive ) to it thats off-putting . i 'm nit-picking because this is certainly a good beer , and better than any mass-produced porter , but i would n't put it much above a anchor porter ( if at all ) - even though it cost me quite a bit more . the tartness kinda reminds me of anchor . fairly complex , but a touch too sour , a touch to dry , and a touch too much alcohol presence for me to really dig this . good not great .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	a very cloudy light orange color , heavy head when poured into you glass but later settles later . has a stale bread smell with the usual suspects of coriander and orange . very nice on the nose . the taste is a clean flavor of coriander and citrus . nice after taste , again very clean in your mouth . light and airy in your mouth . crisp . nice . a good drinkable beer like most hefe 's . like mine just a little more spicy . but again this is a nice crisp beer that you could enjoy during both hot and cold months . and the germans know how to brew a good beer .

0.70 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.80	the beer as most everyone knows is a golden yellow like most macros and has a thin white head that quickly disappears leaving some lacing and little retention . i could hardly get any smell from this beer , so not much to be impressed with . the taste starts out with some corn and sweet malts and later get some hops that nicely balance the malts out . a very smooth , crisp and clean finish that makes this one of the very few aal beers that is tasty and is also satisfying at the same time . a good beer to drink when low on money and in need of one .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.50	tastes like a combo between a stout and a belgian brown ale . the aroma is the best part , but it goes down smooth and tastes nice . flavors of dark coffee , chocolate , and fruit combine nicely with sweet and roasted malt flavors . mouthfeel is relatively light and slick .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	a classic west coast ipa . big grapefruit aroma . good head . high 75 ibu . reasonable 6.6 abv . juicy orange flavour , colour , and good mouthfeel , but no-holds-barred dry bitter aftertaste . a 750 thanks to thebungyo . had to keep in fridge because of the no preservatives notice .

0.40 0.60 0.20 0.30 0.20	a : pours a pale gold with about a finger of white head that disappears too quickly . s : smells of honey and malt . nothing too spectacular , but pleasant . probably the best thing about this beer . t : thin and grassy . very little flavor , with a lingering , indistinct bitterness on the finish . m : watery and disappointing . d : i wo n't be drinking this again . it 's light enough that i could easily put a few away , but i 'm not terribly impressed and feel like my money would be better spent elsewhere . overall impression is that the folks at birra menabrea spv somehow got it into their heads to imitate certain really cheap american beers , and in that regard , it 's a success .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	a - pours a nice amber color with with 1/4 inch of foam s - malty aroma with nutty and caramel hints t - caramel and nut flavor with just a bit of hops to round it out . nothing too overpowering or memorable m/d - overall not very impressive . as a winter ale its not very memorable and there are alot better choices in this category .

0.70 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.50	a- orange amber , crystal clear no haze . 1 finger head . very nice lace . s- smells like , apples ? apple juice ? no hops , no warmth . such an odd flat smell . t- the not impressed continues here . dry hops i would say , sort of a dry apple as well . boring . m- dry ? ! nothing exciting on the tongue . o- i did n't expect greatness from this one . i got less that that and less .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.70	on tap at a beer tasting . managed two glasses before it kicked : ( quite pale yellow with a bit of haze making it sort of glow . fluffy white head , medium carbonation . incredibly fresh hop aroma . absolutely unbelievable . must try these galaxy hops for my homebrew soon . this must have been a prety fresh batch , the brewer mentioned they add 1.5g/l at flameout and it is noticeable . what lets this beer down is the lack of balance with the hopping . while quite aromatic , the bitterness really is low and the flavor is lower than you are led to believe . certainly not bad by any stretch , just that it could be much much better . anyway , as another reviewer mentions , this beer is brewed specifically for the area where it is made . and for that i am sure it fits perfectly , but as a standalone beer , it leaves you feeling short changed .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60	pours cloudy dark amber orange with a 2 finger head that coat the glass with lacing smell is somewhat metallic - watery - but does have some fruity hops and some malts in there taste is a little better - the hops are very fruity - citrus ( kinda sour ) and some apricots which was pleasant - good malt back bone mouthfeel is right - good carbonation crisp and creamy drinkability so so - not a beer i am ging to buy again but it was different

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	a : very clear amber color with a fluffy white head that looked pretty good , but nothing to get to riled up over . s : to be expected ... apricots . the smell of hops was pretty well blended , with citrusy grapefruit and a little piney coming through t : way more bready in the malts than i expected , and the apricot was present but finished the sip and left it feeling not nearly as crisp and hoppy as i expected from the finish . underwhelming . m/d : medium body , if you enjoy the taste you could easily session a few , but i was n't too keen on it . i heard last years was hoppier , this brew missed on that . a more tart finish would have helped .

0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.70	from a 75 cl . pours a lemony golden , barely hazy color with consistent rising bubbles and a sudsy white head that retains well . smells of lemony tartness , fresh grainy malts , and yeast . tastes citrus tart as well , with a hint of esthers and grainy malts . the feel is of potent effervescence and otherwise light-medium bodied . a tasty treat , lower on alcohol than some , so it easy to drink , but not the best trippel i 've had by a long shot . worth trying . probably not going to top my list of beers to buy when i think of trippels though .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80	bottle to pint glass . appearance - nice copper color with a two finger head . head retention is quite good and lace is nice . smell - citrus and strong pine notes with a little bit of earthy smell . very nice on the nose . taste - hop taste comes across pretty strong with an orange/grapefruit taste . it thins out quite a bit about mid-way through and is n't quite as big as i was expecting . the middle/end of each sip has an aspirin like quality that lingers for a while . mouthfeel - medium bodied . carbonation is decent , but not great . overall - not my favorite beer for the style , but a good brew . this was my very first founders beer , i 'll certainly try any others that i can get my hands on .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	ingredients : malt , hops , spices , starch , yeast massive off-white head on a red and opaque beer . intense lacing . heavily hoped nose . rich malt flavor , medium body and intense raw hopiness . this goes down quickly dispite the 750 ml size and agressive bitterness .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	sky high anticipation for this one . have already had raspberry tart and loved it . raspberry tart is the # 2 beer in its style . this is # 1 . no pressure , new glarus , you just have to be out of this world to meet expectations . no pressure.\ belgian red tumbles out of the glass a cross between gold , orange and red . the head that appears is incongruous because without the head , it does n't really look like a beer . wisconsin belgian red presented me with the weirdest `` smells lousy , tastes great '' conumdrum ever . could be me , could be my many bad experiences with vile , vaguely cherry flavored 70s vintage asthma and cold elixirs , but on first whiff , my brain registers `` robitussin '' , and i start to get queasy . once i persuade myself to taste , it 's really good . not nearly as tart as i expected , but still really good . cherry jolly ranchers come to mind.the aftertaste , though , brings the asthma elixir taste back into play though , and that knocks the taste score down . modestly carbonated , yet another new glarus beer that does n't taste like beer . overall verdict , this was a mixed bag for me due to the aroma and the flashbacks it caused . still a good beer , but i definitely think raspberry tart 's the better choice .

0.90 0.30 0.80 0.40 0.20	as a fellow michigander , i was disappointed by this beer . founders makes some great beers , so this must be an anomaly . it poured a beautiful dark amber into my glass . it poured very dense , almost like syrup , which is very inviting . it foams up to 1 finger then dissipates down to a light , white lacing . smells is of vanilla and raw coconut . the coconut flavor overwhelms the smell of the beer . taste is a little better . hops , then raw coconut and vanilla , followed by a heavy alcohol finish . mouthfeel is heavy , but lightly carbonated . the coconut flavor of the beer was so strong that this beer is not drinkable . perhaps this would be alot better if it were better balanced .

0.40 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80	draft , poured into a glass type that i 'm not entirely sure what it was . similar to a pokal , i guess . a : little to no head and i 'll be terribly surprised if any lacing develops . dainty yellow orange color body . there is hardly any visible carbonation . where 's my frothy never ending cap ? where 's the relentless effervescence ? while this brew is mildly attractive in it 's own right , the asylum is way off the mark in terms of tripel-like appearance . s : the nose on the other hand does exhibit most aromas expected for the style . it 's spicy , it 's fruity , highlighting apple juice , pear and honey . all things considered the aroma is pretty decent , but not outstanding . t : the taste follows the nose and is consistent in that it 's lacking in real character . if i do n't get any yeasty phenols , give me some spicy hops . if i do n't get some tongue biting carbonation , at least give me a little alcoholic warmth . something ! m : again , below average . dry finish . d : after all that criticism , i would have to say that the drinkability is decent and it 's score will reflect my honest opinion . sure this is n't a premier tripel , but for what is is , it is not unpalatable by any means .

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.70 0.80	poured a dark black color with a ring of tan bubbles that quickly fades to nothing . aroma of roast , ash , chocolate , dried fruits , vanilla , bourbon , caramel malts , and alcohol . taste of dark fruit , some tropical , sticky molasses , roasted malts , vanilla , and bourbon - alcohol . stiff , and sharp , i like the old viscosity better .

0.80 0.90 0.40 0.40 0.30	served in a riedel ouverture glass at 10.6c ( 51f ) . already when pouring i smell lots of hops ! a : semi hazy ruby copper colour with a thick fluffy slightly tan head . stays in there pretty good . s : crystal malts and american floral hops . blood orange and grapefruit , lots of grain aroma . slightly nutty and syrupy nose . very fresh and clean smell , hardly any yeast aroma . t : wow , really intense ! at first i got a huge hop bitterness blast , followed by an alcoholic bitterness and faint grainy background . lots of hops in this brew , folks ! i expected this beer to be more malty and nutty , like the smell . it actually made me slightly dissapointed . this beer is very american in the sense that it 's a lot of everything , but it 's a bit over the top in many ways imho . it 's not balanced in any way and i do n't understand why it comes in a 650ml bottle - there 's no way you can drink that much , it 's too much even for two or three people . the overall bitterness is too much for me and i ca n't pick up anything else but sharpness and cheap booze . it kinda reminds me of not too good imperial ipas i 've had in the past . promising , but dissapointing . m/d : sharp and crisp , sort of feels like an artifical drink after half a glass . this beer is not for me .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	poured a copper orange color with lots of carbonation bubbles sticking to the side of the glass . the frothy off-white head stuck around for a minute or two . aroma is very inviting with apple , pear , and an awesome yeastiness . the taste is n't as fruity and glorious as the incredible aroma but it is nice and earthy . there is a great toastiness to it and great caramel , bread and diacetyl butter flavor . the more i drink the more i taste the yeast ! this is one awesome and complex brew . slightly bitter but mostly malty . the feel is moderate to thin but smooth and wet . a pint is not enough .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	i sat ready with this beer for my first review , anticipating so much , being a big fan of weyerbacher brews in general , and merry monks in particular . unforunately , a disappointment . 12oz bottle poured a hazy gold into a chalice , first note that something may be off is an absolute lack of head . smell : oh my lord , whiskey . did i use this glass for something stronger and leave a bit behind ? i suspect that there may be more back there , but i ca n't get past the bourbon . i suppose that 's to be expected with the aging technique used ; i just did n't expect it to be such a dominating factor . taste is overly sweet , not what i expected an `` oaked '' tripel to taste like . what happened to the monks , i do n't know , but they 're not merry any more . fans of white wine will like this ; it shares a lot with a dry white . i do n't detect much of the `` smokiness '' or oak depth that i expected . overall , i had expected much more from this . i 'm actually hoping that my initial suspicions of a bad bottle hold true , and that my next try at this will be better ( especially considering that i have the remainder of a half case in the cellar ! )

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.90	a - pours a very dark , viscous brown with small mocha head that retains for a bit . s - good amount of bourbon on the first draw with a sweet , malty background of chocolate , caramel and coffee . it 's almost like smelling a sweet , chocolatey glass of whiskey . t - the taste here is so complex it 's hard to decipher it all . of course the bourbon is there , along with with the chocolate and roasted coffee . some slight notes of vanilla cream and dark fruits as well . i do , however , feel like the bourbon should play more of a supporting role than what i 'm tasting here , i do n't think it 's full masking the flavors , but it 's a little too dominant . m - very creamy and smooth with a good body . a bit of heat from the alcohol hits the back of the throat . good amount of carbonation present . overall - i thought the beer was very , very good , and indeed deserving to be called a world-class beer . but i was a little disappointed in the balance , i felt like the bourbon was just a little too much for own tastes . great beer though .

0.50 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60	a - very dark colour , almost black with some red around the edges . disappointing head , really just a bubbly ring . no lace . s - some sweet roasted malt , faint yeast and nuttiness . t - quite light on for flavour but there is some roasted malts , ash and cola . m - watery thin body but has a chalky quality . fizzy high carbonation . o - very light and mild so easy to drink . the character it has sets it above most australian macros but still a very average beer .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	750ml corked and caged bottle witha bottling date of october 2006 . pours a deep mahagony brown with a 2 finger head and very nice lace . hard to get a decent aroma - i 'm brewing right now so i will give it a average . fruity , earthy , a bit smokey and roasty . ok hop bitterness cosidering the style . alcohol fairly well hidden . smooth and very drinkable . i 'm glad i aged this for a year . nice beer .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass . clear and the color of slightly watered down tea . white head on top of about one finger in size . very nice retention and a great deal of lacing down the sides of the glass . aroma was a bit lacking . a touch of citrus hop and a bit of caramel malt . not too much else . i was slightly disregarded in this aspect of the beer . pretty good flavors . fruity and slightly sweet . a very small touch of hop bitterness . pretty big on the malt as well , making the hops seem less apparent . sweet in the finish . a little too light in the body . slightly alcoholic taste as well with some heat . not too bad . closer to an ipa but good nonetheless .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.40	had on tap in brewery . medium brown color with hints of red . tan head with good retention . earthy , slightly funky barnyard aroma . very sweet , tasting sugar and not just maltiness . there is also a hint of smokiness and some toasted grain character . a hint of hoppiness in the finish . a very unusual taste , somewhat similar to beer made with peat smoked malt . kind of difficult to finish my mug due to the aroma and unusual taste .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.80	12 oz bottle with printed freshness date of 9 july 2010 . a little late but it should still be pretty much ok . appearance : very dark brown with a reddish tint at the edge . minimal tan head dissipated quickly . smell : roasted and caramel malts followed by a slight hint of dark chocolate and coffee . taste : mostly roasted malts with some dark chocolate . more nutty flavor than in the aroma , with an aftertaste that lingers for a while . mouthfeel & drinkability : medium bodied and chewy . modest carbonation makes it easy to down this one .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.60	drank on-tap at the sunset grill & tap , allston , ma 2009 release served in an 8 oz . snifter deep , dark , chestnut brown in appearance . the liquid was capped by a tiny head of saddle brown froth which quickly dissolved . `` legs '' of syrupy liquid dripped down the sides of the glass . the aroma was complex and quite intense . boozy with a sweet , rum-like alcohol profile . possibly some port as well . dark fruits including raisins , prunes and figs came through strong . lots of vanilla too . oaky and a bit smoky . the taste was very similar to the nose . sweet , rich , caramel malt and brown sugar notes appeared up front . dark stone fruits came through in the center . raisins and prunes dominated . dried figs and plums were noticeable as well . slightly smoky with notes of tobacco and molasses . the finish was boozy to the point of being `` hot . '' i found the sticky sweetness resulting from the brandy barrel-aging to be quite apparent . oaky and slightly tannic with a hint of roasted malts . the mouthfeel was medium bodied for the style . a bit thinner than i would have anticipated for a beer of this magnitude . somewhat syrupy and creamy with a fine , moderate carbonation . drinkability was a bit of an issue . although i really enjoyed the overall favor profile , the alcohol heat was overpowering ( especially by the drink 's end ) . i definitely tasted ( and felt ) all 12 % of this monster brew . i sampled the angel 's share - bourbon barrel-aged beer a few months back and can confirm that the brandy barrel-aged example is nearly identical . all in all , this is a terrific beer . i am glad tomme and company were able to take care of the carbonation issues that plagued the 2008 release .

0.60 1.00 0.90 0.70 0.90	this one was kinda all over for me . it was orangish red in color with little to no head and some small chunks . smell is exceptional , with a peach and plum smell up front with a bit of malt and hops to follow . taste is a bit above average , nice and complex but reminds me alot of flavored sparkling water . mouthfeel and drinkablity are very good goes down smooth and easy .

1.00 1.00 0.70 0.20 0.30	poured from a 1pt 9.4 fl oz bottle into a tuilp glass a - dark brown with reddish hues , slightly off-white head which quickly dissipated s - dark plums , raisins , a bit of cherry , brown sugar , cinnamon , some dark bread , dates , gingerbread t - a weird sushi flavor is the first thing i noticed . odd . soy sauce ? overripe plums , vinegar , rotten fruit m - medium d - at 9.4 % this is not one to session , but relax with , which makes it all the more frustrating that the flavors are off . maybe i got a bad bottle so i 'll hold off posting this review until i 've finished my first glass . post-first glass : gets a bit better taste-wise but i 'm still confused by the first impressions . again , maybe i bought an off-bottle . i 'll try it again some time but until then i ca n't really recommend this beer . i am disappoint .

0.70 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	poured from the bottle to a sun king shaped pint glass a dark mahogany brown with a 1/2 finger mocha colored short lasting head leaving no lace . aroma of sweet malts , brown sugars , and dark fruits . sweet , raisins , buttery brown sugars , maple . medium carbonation , hearty , sweet . very drinkable .

0.50 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.90	barleywine . welll , what exactly is a barleywine ? ? this beer pours a deep and murky brown/black into a snifter glass . zero head leads to zero lacing and such , but alas i 'm distracted as we speak . smell is of bourbon barrels , alcohol and some deep plum and cherry/chocolate on the nose . taste follows with notes of the barrel and a very lingering close ... nice.. good feel and the drinkability is extravagant given the potency , as the alcohol is present on the nose but not on the tongue .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.60	poured from the bottle into a sam adams sensory glass . a : as is typical for great lakes , it 's an attractive brew . it 's clearly filtered and is a lovely orange-gold color , with good levels of carbonation . there was n't much head on my pour , and there was no lacing evident as i drank . s : very mild , extremely so . i have absolutely no idea how anyone reviewing this beer would give this high marks on smell . this was a very fresh bottle and it still had almost no aroma . there was some slight malt sweetness with no hop bitterness . i had to stick my nose into the glass and swirl many times just to get anything at all . t : it 's pretty boring , really ... some mild maltiness with a bit of buttery biscuit/cracker going on , with a very mild honey sweetness of caramel malts . the bitterness is very `` european '' and refined , with very mild classic hop notes - nothing great to me . the finish is surprisingly long , with bitterness that lingers in a mildly distasteful manner . there is a mild lemon note on the palate , but it 's decidedly not an american ale citrus flavor . it 's an integrated beer that just is n't very flavorful , really . m : pretty standard ale thickness . great lakes usually nails mouthfeel pretty well . the flavor is pretty thin but the beer itself is fairly substantial . it 's a bit `` zippy '' on the tongue , but it 's ok. d : it 's not very tasty or intense , it 's almost too mild to care about - it certainly wo n't wear you out but it 's not offensive . i 'd want something more flavorful to session , but if you dig extremely mild european ales you might want this . i 'm not very impressed with this , really , it 's a rare miss by my hometown brewery .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.20 0.20	i had this on tap at the founders brewpub . the chalkboard only said `` hot ! hot ! hot ! '' as a description , so i asked the server and was told `` habenero pepper and chocolate infused oatmeal stout '' . having tried some fantastic chili pepper and chocolate beers ( such as fantome chocolate ) , i was excited but unfortunately unprepared for what was to follow . habenero peppers are not friendy peppers . a little must surely go a long way , and can dominate the flavor of anything you mix together with them . and it 's like a sleeper attack as you do n't know you 're gon na get hit until you taste it . there was no hint of pepper in the aroma , just some mildly sweet chocolate and a little roasted malt . but the first sip gave me nothing of those flavors , only intense pepper burn . i felt it for about 5 minutes after the sip , and i spent that time planning my attack for the rest of the beer . i opted for a chug , as i figured it would get the offensive stuff past my sensitive mouth all at one go , and put it in my stomache where it could only attack other things i wanted to digest anyway . so i downed it in 7 seconds and just dealt with the effects best i could . this was not a fun experience overall , taste and drinkability could not be any lower . interesting experiment , but really i think founders could have done much better . i 'd have done 5-gallon homebrew batches and attempted to optimize the amount of habenero first ...

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60	yellow and hazy , no head , tons of nice lacing . smelled great , very witbier like , coriander , fermented yeast , spices and citrus . taste was a little disappointing after the smell . slightly above average but not what you 'd expect . it was very yeasty , too much so , with some spices and citrus present . felt thick and tangy with good carbonation . drink was average as i was n't in a hurry to order another by any means .

0.30 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60	bomber poured into a small tulip . i 'm not quite sure where to review this as no less than 4 different pizza port wipeout ipa 's come up and all are the same brew as far as i can read . this brew has a very lackluster appearance . it takes a mighty effort to build any head and the retention is non existent . orange body . this is of the citrus variety . undertones of pine but mostly fresh citrus and pulp . it tastes much better than it looks . i love the finish as it snaps a pulped up grapefruit mixed with a sharp , young lime . bitter mouth and finishes lingering . chalky finish . notes : this is a solid brew . something is missing in the carbonation and mouthfeel as it lingers and never really cleans up . i love pizza port and i 'm so happy they are expanding and starting to bottle some of their gems . this is fantastic on tap but its just ok out of the bottle . i 'm sure it will change as they get the bugs worked out . an above average to average ipa at this point .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.70	bottle dated bb feb 2011 . christmas gift . thanks love ! a : pours an orange-red hue with a nice white head that descends to a small ring . surprisingly , no lacing . s : sweet caramel malt aromas with a light earthy hop aroma . nice . t : nothing special here . light sweet malt flavours with a cidery aftertaste . m : surprisingly thin beer that finishes dry . d : very drinkable for a such a large beer and the style . a surprise i would consider again .

0.40 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.20	22 oz . bottle appearance : this was a bright yellow beer with a heavy chill haze . it was obvious even in the brown bottle . it poured with a tiny , coarse head that vanished without a trace before i took the first drink . smell : the smell was very elusive at first . there was a very faint hint of malt and an odd , artificial lemon aroma . the lemon part reminded me of what some malternatives smell like . as the beer warmed up , it was obvious that it smelled just like lemon pine-sol . as it continued to get even warmer ( i had stopped drinking it by this time ) more odd , unnatural , sometimes industrial-like odors began to stir from the glass . blech ! then i made the mistake of smelling the bottle . now i see where the name bullfrog ale comes from ; it smelled like one was floating belly up in there . mouthfeel : there was an odd , chalky feel to this beer . it kind of left my tongue feeling like it was covered in dust . thin- to medium-bodied . taste : the overriding component of this beer was an artificial tasting lemon flavor . it had an odd twang to it that lingered in a bad way . there were some mild malt flavors in the middle . the finish was somewhat wheat-like , combined with that ever present lemon twang . i could n't even finish half a pint of this stuff .

0.70 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.70	i picked up this beer at my local haggen grocery for 4.99 . brewed in austria the bottle text claims this beer is `` perhaps the rarest in the world '' and is `` the worlds most extraordinary beer '' ... rather bold statements but they served their purpose and sparked my inerest . my example was bottled in 2004 . this poured to a somewhat subdued amber glow with a fuzzy white head which quickly dissipated and became virtually non-existent with virtually no lacing . the smell is extremely vibrant and spicy reminding me immediately of egg-nog . body being more like a whiskey than a beer with an extremely syrup-like texture . upon my first sip my mouth immediately puckered after being slammed with a louisville slugger of flavor which this beer posesses . at 14 percent the taste and overall character of this beer is very `` whiskeylike '' and can easily overwhelm . despite being very interesting and flavorful it becomes difficult to drink about halfway through . i recommend everyone try this if they get a chance just for kicks ... but once will probably be enough .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	shiner ruby redbird 12 oz . bottle ; $ 1.49 total wine & more , claymont , de so i have a shiner ruby redbird sitting here before me . i know nothing about it except that it 's listed here on ba as a `` fruit / vegetable beer '' . odd . it poured a clear deep-golden orange amber body beneath a short head of white that simply vanished . perhaps my glass is not `` beer clean '' , but it only leaves minor spots of lace that appear and fade between sips . the aroma is interesting . it 's sweetish , and spicy . i 'm thinking ginger and lemon , and perhaps some berries ( which is probably coming from the yeast ) . it 's clean and inviting . in the mouth it 's light-medium in body and gently zesty . the flavor clearly displays the ginger . it has the spiciness , but it also has the more 'meaty ' flavor of the ginger . i 'm not sure about the lemon i found in the nose as it seems more like lime here . regardless , there 's a little bit of citric acid tartness that helps balance it as there 's very little bitterness ; however , the malt is n't really that sweet , it 's just a slightly bready , straightforward golden malt . you notice the malt at the end , but upfront it 's all ginger . i sampled this beer fairly warm , and i wonder what it would be like ice-cold on a sunny day while cooking outdoors . the cold might make it seem a little more spicy and gingery . and it would cover up the malt a bit more ... it 's almost not a `` beer '' . but ok , it 's at least refreshing , and a touch interesting . it 's not a beer that i 'd immediately reach for or buy again , but i can think of quite a few mainstream american lagers and/or light beers that i 'd pass over for this one . i 'm not sure i can give this one a `` worth trying '' , but that would n't be the worst thing you could do .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.80	appearance- dark ruby read with a creamy 2 fingered head . aroma- none . i mean non existant . taste : vienna malt shines . a little underbalanced on the hops but malt flavor is there . good job mouthfeel : excellent . creamy . no astringency . drinkability : an excellent beer to beat the new orleans heat ! !

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.50	poured a burnt orange . off-white head is fizzy . it dissipates quickly but with good retention and lacing . the nose is sweet malts with hints of golden fruit and a smattering of spiciness . i 'm encouraged by the fact that alcohol is nowhere to be found . the flavor is where this beer lost me . first , it 's way too boozy . a lot of burn in the finish . but the alcohol masks some of the flavor from at the front end of each sip . the fruitiness is akin to orchard fruit soaked in run and the spiciness is faintly clove-like . think well-brewed american malt liquor with more hop bitterness and a less than stellar belgian yeast strain . the mouthfeel is all right . it 's full , sticky on the finish and carbonated enough to keep the tongue tingly without providing much lift and volume . it 's pretty rough though . trippel is far from horrible , but it 's not that great either . it'sa shame , too , because i have had some really good beers from green flash ( the double stout is really good . )

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	poured into a pint glass . the appearance is a hazy ochre , gold brown , with a fluffy , sticky off white head . the aroma is very subtle but you can pick up on the yeasts used , and sweet grain . what a flavor here . toasted crystal malt brings a caramel/vanilla flavor , slight hop bitter but more spicy than piney . not as bitter as some american esbs i have had , but the balance is appreciated here . a little citrusy in the finish , some orange peel . creamy , delectable mouthfeel , well carbonated and highly balanced . balance . it 's the measure of life right ? when things are out of balance , they miss the sweet spot in the middle . balance . this beer is balance .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	poured into a standard pint . clear light mahogany color with a large fizzy head that disapates rapidly . almost no lacing to speak of . smelled great very rich and malty . unfortunantly that aroma did not carry over in the taste which was on the weak side . it drinks ok and for a novist it might be a good jumping off beer for an abby belgian but very weak for a seasoned drinker .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	the color is dark brown nearly black with a hint of mahogony when in direct light . has a very thick light brown head that stays and stays . it was very hard for me to pick up much aroma thru that thick head . i did manage to pick up some maltyness with maybe a hint of butter . the flavor had a definite coffee and chocolate presence and a good roasted malt bitterness on the finish .

0.40 0.70 0.40 0.20 0.20	had on tap at the hotel as the last in a sample paddle . pours a pale apricot colour with steady bead , not much head though . slight cloud in the brew with no lace . looks fizzy , and pretty boring . ooh yeah , intense ginger on the nose , lots of spice character . slight citric twang but mostly lots and lots of ginger . that 's ... about it . delivers what it promises though , and delivers well . taste is insanely sweet . oh my dear god of treacle-coated corn syrup , horrible . candied ginger and mega sugar all over that . it tastes like ginger ale , with lots of sucrose added . but basically , sweet with traces of ginger at the back . this is completely disgusting and nothing like beer should be . a travesty . mouthfeel is syrupy and thick with no tingle , just very viscous . needs more texture , i guess because there are n't a lot of ingredients here . admittedly this is probably brewed with a 'dessert beer ' style in mind , but my problem with it is twofold - one , it 's horribly oversweet . two , and this is the unforgivable point , i like to think that i can objectively review a beer i dislike by looking at the craft behind making it . but i find none in this brew . it seems to me that to construct a beer like this , you put a relatively large amount of malt into water for a short boil , and add ginger . it 's so simple , and that i ca n't respect . if i were at home this would definitely be a drainpour . here it 's take a few sips and leave it on the table . such a disappointing effort from an otherwise excellent brewery , and a terrible way to end the paddle .

0.60 1.00 0.50 0.80 0.60	a : mine came in a belgian style bomber , unlike the one displayed . it pours with robust carbonation with what looks similar in color and clarity to what is seen in a hefe . it 's hazy , pale , and yellow with a head that drops off after a minute or so with decent visible carbonation . s : it has the slight scent of fruit , but more as an ester than actual fruit . it smells like vanilla , cream , and familiar belgian yeast . after pouring more i get some apple smell out of it and it smells a lot like apples and cream . it smells wonderful . t : it has a light cream flavor as well . i pick up some light apple flavor , but not a whole lot . it comes out more after i drink it . it 's not a very complex beer though , and is pretty thin . the distinct belgian flavor is there . it 's tasty but does n't pack as much of a punch as i 'd like with flavor . again it has a watery character to it ... but it 's still good . m : i 'd say the mouthfeel is below average . it 's light bodied , but is n't really memorable . i enjoyed the apple aftertaste but it tastes a lot like an apple soda where they added too much carbonated water and not enough syrup . o : overall it 's a good belgian style beer , and the apple does add to it . however , it does n't stand head above shoulders . i would drink it again , but i probably wo n't be picking it up off the shelf any time soon .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	a : pale golden color with a huge and wispy white head that turns pretty cobwebby as it goes down . s : light citrus aroma , grain , horse blanket and fritos . not exactly appetizing . t : it 's actually not that bad . there is n't a lot of flavor here , but it 's crisp and clean and does n't get incredibly undrinkable as it warms . one of the better lagers in mass production . light citrus and pale malts along with the slightest bit of grassy hops .

1.00 0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80	08-09 winter bottle out of a 6pack . pitch black with a tan head and incredible lacing . smell has a bit of alcohol in there which i would expect , but i did n't pick up the alcohol in the taste . very powerful and tastey . i may have to get another 6er to age .

0.70 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.80	another sample poured by the busty black girl at the juke joint in that atlanta airport . off the tap this beer displayed a mediocre tan head of mid-size bubbles and a copper colored liquid leaning towards the red side . it laced like a jigsaw puzzle all the way down my glass too . no visible carbonation rising in the beer . as for the aroma ... where is the aroma ? musty malt and faint grains ; too subtle in my opinion . malts are the most distinct flavors in the beer with a bready quality in particular , some nuttiness and again that horse-saddle mustiness . a farmhouse style flavor palate . feisty carbonation neutralized some of the flavors . not as deep as it could be for a brown but above average for an airport beer .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.70	500th review here , thought this would be somewhat appropriate . this bottle is the 2008 vintage . pours a very hazy , bright orange color with an initially fat tan head that fades ridiculously fast to near nothingness . lacing is minimal . not much of a looker here as it is very light colored for a quad and head retention is very poor . ahh , the smell makes up for the poor visual aspect ... it is phenomenal ! vanilla , oak , alcohol , cotton candy , almonds , brown sugar and an elusive fruitiness that i cant put my finger on ... perhaps some pears and red grapes ? nonetheless , this is an outstanding nose . barrel aging is very evident upon tasting , as is the alcohol . it is rummy and even a bit like whiskey . could cellar for a while longer , for sure . light bodied for a quad and drier than most , but it still retains some sweetness typical of the style . there is a nice bready , yeasty characteristic , but not quite enough . to me , it almost seems like a tripel and a half , as it needs a bit more body-adding malts and the alcohol is a bit rough ... but that is being a bit picky , i am very glad i brought this out for my 500th . great beer and i am sad that weyerbacher has discontinued the brew .

0.90 0.70 0.90 1.00 0.80	this beer appears brown with reddish notes when held up to the light , quite cloudy . pours with a lively carbonation that creates a beige head . a slightly sweet aroma , along with a mustiness and a bit of a sour aroma . a definite sour taste in this one but only lightly so . definite belgian character in this beer ; musty , fruity , and slightly funky . a tart cherry flavor is here as well . fairly dry , a slight pepperiness and a general spiciness to this brew . fairly complex , even has a slight vinous note to it .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70	it has been decades since i have had a michelob . it has been so long i can not remember if this version is anything like what i used to drink . anyway , on to the review . for an american macro lager , it is pretty darn good . it is your typical golden yellow clear fizzy beer . upfront , it is crisp , has some sweetness , and goes down smooth . it finishes off with a little hop bitterness . it is a nice beer . this is exactly what you want in an american macro lager . i have been pleasantly surprised with some of michelob 's recent offerings .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70	i 'll be as objective as possible since this happens to be one my favorites . we bought a draught keg of this and it poured out very cloudy with a golden apperance , not much of a aroma to brag about , however , you can smell faint aromas of lemon in this . the taste is very wheaty and dry which make it great for the summer . pair this beer with any of light meat , marinated pork with lemon slices will do you proud , ps , if youre ever in st. louis , make an effort to get over the brewery in maplewood .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured into a pint glass . pours a dark , translucent orange , like a cloudy iced tea . almost no head , goes from a half finger to nearly nothing , white . smells of lychee , pineapple , hops , sweetness . exceptional aroma . very hoppy , and you get it at the first sip , then the sweetness , finishes bitter , with all the hops of an ipa but more subdued . significant tropical fruits on the middle , more of the lychee ( kind of like fruit cocktail , if you 've never had this ) , but the sweetness is only on the back end and not overpowering . clear , refreshing mouthfeel . smooth , and great drinkability for its strength . first barleywine for me , so take this review with a grain of salt , and if it 's characteristic of the style it 'll be a new favorite really quickly . it 'd be a waste to pair with food . have this one to sip after the meal .

0.50 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70	i almost feel like my review is an anomaly . maybe i got a flat one . it pours a dark amber color with just a little head . i had no lacing down the glass and the head was gone in a couple seconds . i thought the smell was the best part . a lot of sweetness in the smell with some malt in the background . there 's a lot of caramel coming through in the smell . i really like it . the taste is sweet with a little malt . there 's a lot of carbonation and not a lot of bitterness . this is mild for a lot of amber ales out there . not really a strong flavor . overall , i did n't find this to be great . i have another bottle and will review again when i get to that one .

0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.50	pours a yellow gold with a small head with white lacing . the smell is very weak with only a hint of floral wheat . the taste is hoppier than most wheat beers and kind of overpowers the wheat lemon flavor . there is some honey and sweet floral malt flavors , but the hops really make everything else second best . the m/f is light and does n't mix too well . not one of gritty 's best .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.40	this is my second try with a high-alcohol beer ; the first time was at a party years ago and i was too drunk to remember whether or not i enjoyed whatever it was that i drank , i just remembered that it was really strong . this comes in an absolutely beautiful bottle and pours a thick , very dark red . the consistency of blood , actually . kind of pretty , in a way , and i mean that without any goth implications . smells like sour soy sauce -- like a really strong , old port . this is n't a horrible smell , mind you , just not what i was expecting . not very nice . tastes much better than it smells . very sweet with some sour mixed in , and there is a definite maple syrup aftertaste . this would make for a good dessert , like a mead . as a matter of fact , i would say that this tastes more like a good mead than anything else , only with really nice sour tones . it 's kind of slimey , but full . not something that you 'd want to pound , of course . i could n't see myself drinking more than three ounces or so at a time .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.30	stopped by brawley 's looking for another sn harvest and got this as a suggestion for something `` similar '' ... not similar at all . a : pours beautifully , great 1+ '' head and lacing during the drink . color is clear and great . s : grapefruit hoppy smell is strong but good , looking forward to the drink . t : first taste hit like a grapefruit and quickly becomes oily and very alcohol taste ... not good once my tastebuds recovered a little . this is very sweet and taste to me like a mix between a ipa and a bourbon ( as far as strong alcohol taste ) ... and i think that 's why i did n't like it . and when i burped it was all alcohol . m : this and oily and heavy ... . d : since i poured from a 22oz bottle i have another glass left ... not sure i can do it ... . edit : actually i could n't finish the second glass , not a good balanced beer at all .

0.80 0.20 0.30 0.20 0.30	i love chipotle spices and i love ale . but this beer did not hit my tongue in a favorable way and i had to pour most of it out . the smoky spices were overwhelming and no malt or hop flavor or aroma could break through . very disappointing , since i am a fan of rogue 's other products . the taste of the beer just did n't do it for me at all . it was n't too spicy , it just tasted funky . might have been a bad bottle , but i never want to smell this beer again ! the beer did look nice and red in the glass , but i would n't be surprised if it was food coloring .

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.60 0.60	glass : snifter temp : cellared @ approx 45 degrees pours a straight dark brown color that is nearly opaque . small head of loose , tan foam forms , then dissipates rather quickly . lacing is clumpy and rather sticky . smell is like a fresh loaf of sweet fruit bread , drizzled with rum sauce . huge bready/yeasty notes . big notes of dark plums and cherries . mild notes of semisweet chocolate . belgian candi sugars . it took a minute to identify a certain element of the smell , but it 's almond paste ( marzipan ) . the nose is quite enticing . wow , did that nose ever set me up for disappointment . the flavors fall completely flat here . the yeastiness overpowers everything else , but not in the good way , like a tripel or something . it 's just almost all that there is , to this one . it 's like a big chunk of bread , dipped in caramel sauce which has some dark fruits floating in it . huge bready flavor , light caramel sweetness and a hint of dark fruits , that you wish were more prominent . medium body , which is also a sort of letdown . this style should be big , thick and creamy . this one is smooth , but not really creamy , at all . low level of carbonation kills the body on this one . yeah , it 's drinkable , but i wo n't be rushing to try to track down another bottle anytime soon . i 'd love to try it again , do n't get me wrong . it just wo n't be high on my list of future aquisitions . if i see it , i 'll give it another shot . mikkeller , you 've let me down .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60	to be sure , paulaner oktoberfest is a pretty beer with its vibrant amber hue and impressive clarity . the taste does not overpower -- it was probably never meant to -- but instead provides a syrupy smoothness , pleasantly sweet , with a slight toasted character . it 's quite mellow . the sweetness gives the beer an almost candy-like quality , the perfect dessert for a long week 's work . this beer is n't perfect however , with it 's unimpressive and muted smell and a thick mouthfeel that can grow a little tiresome over an entire exclusive evening with this drink . this is a beer that you want to sip , relish , and move away from .

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	a - pours a dead black . nice thick frothy dark brown head . reduces to a ring , but lots of this sticky lacing . s - coffee . geez . in the mix , anise , chocolate , dark cooked fruits . t - taste emulates smell but not to the same degree . like how the coffee comes through , but not the typical bitterness . alcohol apparent but not reflective of the abv . m - medium to heavy , good carb , great coating . d - for the style and abv , great drinkability !

0.80 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.30	nice right before dark orangeness in the color . a hearty thick head that left a whole lotta lace residue and a hearty cap through the whole thing . i 'm not really too familiar with the farmhouse ale style but the scant i tried so far did have an earthy and grassy scent . this smells `` earthy '' but instead of some wide flower meadow ... .well it smells more like the farm field where the goats and chickens run around after a rain than it does the farmhouse up by the road with the scent of wild flowers in vases and the aroma of fresh baked rhubarb pie from the oven . there 's a weird tartness up front . funk ? ya got that right . it 's almost like they took dried orange peels and pepper corns and cooked them in butter til they were almost black . maybe on some fish or an odd cut of beef it may be okay but it 's just not cutting it here . this odd not all that pleasant stickiness goes away as the brew warms up . problem is that the weird `` organic fertilizer '' scent gets stronger too . the smell kills noticing any other nuances which are just odd and not all that appetizing to this palate anyways . the finish is almost like a well balanced lemony summer whit but then that ( ungood ) funk shows up again .

0.70 0.40 0.40 0.70 0.30	pours a clear , orange/amber color with a white head . decent retention . smell is musty , hops , real light citrus note and some vanilla . taste is sweet , hops , malt , citrus , grapes . warming does not do it any favors . somewhat fizzy , tart , lightish body . better than an american mega but not by much .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.50	appearance : this beer pours an almost hazy rustic orange color with a very thin head on it , and it left almost no lacing to speak of for the entire beer . smell : i first get an almost sweet floral scent coming in as i pour with strong bubble gum notes to it as well . as i get my nose into this beer the hot alcohol become very strong as well . as i let the beer warm it really came into its own with vibrant scents of pears , prunes , passion fruit , and a belgian yeast strain that is typical of good quads . taste : the first sip of this beer is almost over top in sweetness that tasted like concentrated apple juice . i really let the beer warm up and the flavors of the orchard fruit really came to life including apple , oranges , and peaches . the complex malt also brings on life of raisins and plums , cloves , nutmeg , and even cotton candy . the hot alcohol though is very apparent on the palate as well . mouthfeel : more than moderate carbonation brings the flavors to life , so that is welcomes , but the alcohol is very hot on the mouthfeel . drinkability : a whole bomber of this beer is a tough task for just one person , and the alcohol overtook some of the great qualities this beer had .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	interestingly , taste is unlike the smell ... and that 's a good thing . aroma is typical lager , run-of-the-mill beer . but the taste is anything but typical ! there is a sweet , toffeeish taste ... this could be fantasticly refreshing beer for a hot , summer day !

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80	the 22 oz bomber poured into a tulip glass produced a black body toped of by a two finger tan head . that settles into a nice thick lace covering most of the glass yes it 's a chocolate stout and the aromas defiantly back it up lots of sweet chocolate aromas some earthiness to it along with some hint of roasted malts flavor 's of dark chocolate are dominate not overly sweet with a coffee backbone it 's got this mocha thing going on the mouthfeel is medium to thin would have liked it a little thicker this is really one of the great chocolate stout 's especially for under $ 5 a bomber well worth the experience

0.70 0.50 1.00 0.90 1.00	poured a cloudy amber with a half a finger of head . there is very little smell , which i would say is a flaw for style . the taste however is fantastic , malty and a citrusy hop bite on the aftertaste . mouthfeel and drinkability could n't be better which is impressive for an 8.4 % abv beer .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	on draft during this weekend 's stone orgy @ abraxas . pours a `` thin black '' - while the color is similar , you can tell it 's not a stout , as it does not pour like black oil . thin head . aroma is hugely redolent of skunky , sticky bud if you ask me . hugely hoppy , very fresh , quite similar to rubbing a fresh hop cone in your hands and sniffing . with a smell like that , you *know* what it is going to taste like . the first glass of this is shockingly bitter . not unenjoyable , but very bitter , so much that i did n't really notice much else . the second glass , i noticed a pleasant citric sweetness beginning to creep in . for such a dark beer , i do n't get much roasty character at all , which is fine with me here . this beer is all about the hops - at least if it is fresh . mouthfeel is full and sticky . extremely-hopped beers make me thirsty , and this is not an exception . i 'd say it 's pretty drinkable as things like this go - hell , i had 3 of them , i must have liked drinking it .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	nice flow into my glass resulting in a two finger head of dense off white , to very light yellow foam . lace is a little broken , but has a good cling . color is a 6 on the srm beer color chart , with clear presentation and lots of micro bubbles . smell is heavenly , with the almost overpowering aroma of peaches . there are also fragrances of melon , lime peel , and flowers . i wish the taste was a good as the smell , but it was a muted version , with flavors of peaches , slightly sour oranges ... maybe tangelos , something in there is like swiss cheese , and a whips of grapefruit . mouthfeel is full and creamy , with a potent explosion of carbonation . there is a slight coating of sweet , sticky phlegm in the back of my throat , but it is sort of pleasing . over all this was a great journey and the buzz is just what i needed . if i see the label again , i will most certainly put it in my shopping vessel .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured into a brooklyn lager pint glass.best before 06/19/07 very clear golden body with a bone white head that is about 1 finger thick.it then fell to a ring around the glass.leaves nice lacing on the glass when drank half way through . very clean smell with a sorda corn hint to it . the first taste that comes to my palate is nachos and or corn.i dont really taste the malt in this stuff , there is a slight hop bitterness.its very refreshing and above slighty carbonated . this is a fine lager and taste nothing like im used to in the lager dept.well done .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.60	750ml bottle poured into wine glasses . look : pours very , very cloudy yellow . there 's a huge amount of carbonation to the point where this could pass for champagne . white colored head retains well but leaves the glass without lacing . there are also clumps of dark sediment at the bottom and it does n't look like the normal yeast sediment you 'd expect from a witbier . smell : smells almost like a perfume . its very floral and the lavender is actually very present . its strange but interesting . behind that , there 's the smell of yeast , the spices , wheat and citrus . i actually find i really enjoy the smell of this one and am smelling it frequently even when i am not going to take a sip . taste : follows the aroma but it is not as powerful tasting as it is smelling . the lavender is n't as potent in the taste but there 's a long of citrusy flavor and lemon and grapefruit zest come out prominently . feel : not really bitter at all . initially its very carbonated but it settles down quickly . very crisp and enjoyable mouthfeel but a little dry as it warms . medium-light in body . drink : i do n't think i would want to drink this all night because there 's a lot going on here and because of the dryness . you certainly could if you wanted . overall , this is a very solid beer and the bruery should be proud . i 'll definitely look into their other beers that i see available . this is a delicious witbier . worth a try if its available to you .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.30	v.07 highly anticipated . nice looking pour - fruit-like appearance with hue . very aggressive carbonation , with tight white long lasting head . fruity/bready beer nose . pleasant . hot & heavy alcohol presence ( too much for my liking ) , with a cloying barleywine distinction . not as fruit/wine-like as i would have expected . not refreshing . not very complex . dfh has n't impressed me in quite a while now . i think i 'm done giving them the benefit of the doubt . and my money .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.80 0.60	reviewed by three people after picking up a bottle at the stone brewery , world bistro & gardens gift shop . appearance : looks darn good . just like stone 's traditional russian imperial . smell : all three of us agreed there 's some serious pepperoni going on . taste : drinkable . could use more cheese . mouthfeel : quite nice , actually . overall : it would be a good addition to your next stout-tasting party . not something we 'd drink on a regular basis , but we certainly respect stone for taking a chance and changing up their tried-and-true formula this year . but we 're also glad to have purchased a few bottles of their original recipe on our brewery visit .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	a 12 ounce bottle purchased to-go from the craft ale house for around $ 2 . poured into my nonic imperial pint glass . appears a dark brown color akin to cola with a fizzy , quickly dissipating head to match . the nose is greeted with notes of sweet molasses , chocolate , and medium roasted grains . aroma is the best thing this stout has going for it . tastes of watered down mildly roasted grains , bitter cocoa , maybe some very watery weak coffee . has a seltzer water aftertaste . a bit thin bodied with medium to moderate carbonation .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80 1.00	pale orange with very little head . not a lot of aroma . crisp mouthfeel with a very nice bready , wheat flavor . not yeasty with banana flavors -- not anything like a hefeweizen , really . the hops add to the flavor without disturbing it -- without taking over . instead , they add a nice balance to the bready wheat . this is a nicely constructed beer . it would be easy to drink at least a bomber by myself , though i am sharing it today . cheers !

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	this bottle is a great example of packaging done right . if i did n't know better i 'd say they took a cue from beau 's . regardless , well done muskoka . great looking bottle . it pours a beautiful cloudy reddish amber colour with a soapy head . it dissapates quickly leaving behind some lacing , settling to a ring of foam around the glass . great colour on this one . the smell initially was a fairly muted biscuity , grassiness . however after allowing it to warm lots of berry fruitiness is coming through . any talk of cascade hops that others are mentioning is lacking with my bottle . the taste is a mild mix of sweet malts , fruitiness and slightly grassy bitter hops . there 's some oxidation present in the background.. like a touch of wet cardboard however . balance is good . mouthfeel i think is where this beer starts to fall down . it 's a bit thin and watery . my first thought when tasting it was , this is good - but there 's something missing and i think it 's in the mouthfeel . the carbonation just does n't seem full enough . drinkability is decent . i would n't say i 'm gulping it down but it 's pleasantly drinkable . with all that said , muksoka - keep up the good work . this is a great move and here 's hoping there 's more success to come !

0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.80	poured from an 12 oz . bottle into a pilsner glass . pours a deep mahogany brown with ruby highlights and a 3 finger khaki colored fluffy head . excellent head retention and lacing . smell : sweet caramel malt , chocolate , dried fruits and a hint of sweet and smoky barbecue sauce . taste : toasted bread and dried fruits up front followed by caramel and alcohol in the middle before ending with mildly bitter earthy hops at the finish . the alcohol definitely comes through , but not in a bad way . the aftertaste is bittersweet and long-lasting . mouthfeel : full-bodied and creamy with a decent amount of carbonation . goes down very smooth . drinkability : high drinkability . you could knock back a couple despite the alcohol being clearly evident throughout . overall : very good beer overall . i would definitely recommend checking this one out , especially if you are a fan of doppelbocks .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	poured a dark red-brown with a one finger head . the smell did n't give much away other than chocolatey malt and hops , so when i took the first sip i was surprised and utterly pleased . notes of fruit , a little nutty with a slightly bitter spicy hop aftertaste . this is a very memorable beer , i think i 'll keep tasting it in my mind for some time to come . 5.6 % abv

0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.80	twelve oz . bottle pours a golden orange , cloudily unfiltered-looking brew below a minimal amount of head , light to no lacing along the edges of the pint glass . the aroma is very sweet with a ( expectedly ) hoppy fragrance . hints of melon , cantalope or honeydew , as well . the taste is well balanced with hops and malt notes making for a light and very , very smooth mouthfeel . lightly carbonated , this beer finishes strong and smooth , with hops at the back of the palate . quite the thirst-quenching beer , would go great with a meal .

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.30 0.30	750ml bottle with a `` 96 '' written in sharpie on the cap . i was pretty excited to drink a nearly 9 yr old brew , but as i uncorked the bottle , i noticed that the cork was very dry and nearly falling apart - not a good sign . it poured a hazy honey-orange color into a chimay chalice with only the slightest bit of carbonation . just a few wisps of head . the smell was earthy and of tart fruits . i was expecting a belgian strong pale ale and instead got a lambic/gueze hybrid that tasted like it had been stored next to a furnace . overly sour and tasted of musty hay and green apples . very watery mouthfeel due to the lack of carbonation . could n't even finish this one . quite unbalanced and disappointing . this beer came highly recommended to me from the owner of a local liquor store , though he did mention that there were a lot of variation between batches . do n't know if i got a bad one due to qc issues .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	pours a two-fingered off-white head that fades quickly leaving some lace . cloudy amber color . light carbonation and medium bodied . nose is not there . starts as a moderate malt/hop mix with a woody overtone . hoppy after taste . 12 oz bottle from their winter sampler 12-pak $ 9.99 , market basket concord , nh .

0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.50	poured into a goblet glass revealing a one-finger head of coarse bubbles that quickly settled into zero . aroma was lightly malty , but was one of those strange moments where once i smelt the beer i knew i was n't going to like it very much . taste confirmed my hunch . the initial taste took me aback due to the astringency . the shock of the first sip wore off and the rest of the beer was more tasty , revealing deep malt flavors , but for me the alcohol was too prominent to make this beer enjoyable . to be fair , barleywine is not my favorite style , but i 've been trying all the clipper city offerings after having the loose cannon , which is by far the best of the line . i 've been a bit disappointed with the others , and this is no exception .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90	i had this beer in the recently opened chinese tea house in brussels . the beer looks like any pilsner , clear golden-yellow with a nice head , which disappears in a lacing relatively soon . smell : not too special , just grass , grain and floral hops . taste : this is a special lager beer . grainy , light bitter hops , but with some very nice balanced soft sweetness , completely different from all other lager beer i had until now . this sweetness resembles a bit banana taste with some citrus fruits . maybe it is from the rice , which is added to the brewing process ( as it reads on the bottle ) . mouthfeel : normal carbonation and normal bodied for the style . very drinkable overall : a surprisingly unique beer for the style . will drink this again for sure

0.40 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	a more dark , pale yellow hue than most american pale wheat elas . more amber thab yellow even . not a great head of any kind . just normal . very little bubbling and no lacing at all . the aroma hints at more of a tart belgian ale than a ami wheat or even s witbier . the atste is mildly tart , this is ok becasue it 's so differebt from what i 'm used too . probably wo n't buy again .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.20	discovered on tap at brixx ice company in dayton . poured from the tap into a standard pint glass . appearance- beer pours not quite black with thick clingy lacing , more of a darkened amber with red hues shining through . i can see the sports playing on the tv behind when i hold it up . one finger deep lingering head . smell- roasty and malty with much hop presence . more roasted barley than chocolate , but chocolate persists . hops are pretty strong , but not overpowering . taste- roasty , hoppy and smooth with yeasty esters , but outside of that.. the tap is not clean , and the beer is infected , showing big metallic traces . this is clearly not the ideal venue for reviewing . first i had this problem here with founders dirty bastard , now this . tastes off , but i would n't blame great lakes . unfortunately , to the untrained drinker , that 's exactly what will happen . mouthfeel- thin and metallic . quite astringent . normally the beer is creamy and smooth , lightly carbonated . drinkability- normally i would give this beer about a 4 or 4.5 on drinkability , but this time i have to give it a 1 . i could n't even finish this one . no more of these today . shame on you brixx ice company , shame on you . cleanliness is important with tap handles . i guess some bars are only in it for the swilling needs .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90	this beer pours a hazy golden color , with a small head that disapated . there isnt much of a smell at all . the taste is full of spices , and a strong organe flavor , very simialir to a belgian witbeir . nice carnonation and easy to drink . overall a good beer , but much like a belgian pale ale , but its still enjoyabe , i was expecting a differnt taste .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.80	enjoying this brew on a deck in south australia ( 10 miles from the brewery ) seems fitting for a nice and warm ( 98 degree ) day . bottle poured into a standard pub glass . a- thefinger width head disspears instantly after the pour . as bottle conditioned any disturbance will fill the glass with a lot of yeast ( not a bad thing ) straw like color with lots of yeast floating about . high carbonation does give it a 'sparkling ' appearance in the glass s- faint if anything . t- light , crisp , highly carbed , clean . again , you need to enjoy this in australia on a hot day . m- light and crisp . o- this beer really fits the territory . i ca n't imagine enjoying this on a cold new england night , but it really fits the bill in oz . clean , crisp and refreshing- a great beer for a hot summer day .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.90	belgian dubbel ? hell yeah i 'll have one . i believe this is a hard beer to mess up so i passed on the sampler and went for a goblet . the appeareance is hard to review as the place is so dark but from what i could tell deep red . aroma is another difficult charectoristic to describe as i do n't think you can get a good whiff through the cloud of smoke . upside is the taste and mouthfeel , this is the reason i will return . balance is n't perfect but it is pretty close for this place . in the past i really have n't had anything that would make me want to take home a growler to my buddies , this is the exception .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	the label on the bottle says 2000 vintage but the cork says bottled in 2.002 , 750 ml bottle this lambic pours like champagne with a big , soft , soapy head that does n't last that long . beautiful gold color , not heavily carbonated . aroma has lemons with a kind of sugary sweetness . the aroma is very , very nice . a very clean tasting lambic , dry , a little chalky on the back of the throat , not as much sour as one expects but very drinkable i think i got a good deal , $ 15 at new beer in nyc . seen this beer from $ 25- $ 30 elsewhere .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.40	22 oz bottle on the first of october . poured into a big ol ' mug . pours an amber-orange color , with a very slight haze . the head is white with a slight bit of tan to it . head is nice and fluffy but some of the bubbles at the top are a bit large . a very malty aroma wafts from the glass . it 's pretty rare that a beer 's aroma reaches me before i pick up the glass . it smells really really sweet , with a ton of caramel and toffee , some of it likely coming from dark lovibond crystal . some nuttiness is in there as it warms , reminding me of peanut butter . the hops come through as it warms too , which add some herbal and wood qualities . wow ! this is malty . this one really covers my mouth with sweetness . it has a bit too much for my tastes , and it kind of masks any nuances in the beer . caramel seems to be the main flavor but its a bit too coating . i keep getting confused by the oktoberfest style the more i try them , but i feel like this is just too high in alcohol for this malty of a beer . it kind of reminds me of a scotch ale or bock . i 'm not a huge fan of those types of beers , so while i can appreciate this beer , its not totally my thing . mouthfeel is really big and coating . i would use smooth but there is a bit of an alcohol burn and aftertaste sweetness that makes it linger a bit too much . drinkability is okay , but the abv is just too high . if i were to drink mug after mug of a beer on a october afternoon , i would n't choose this one .

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.70	12oz bottle obtained via trade with crjmellor . thanks for the opportunity ... poured into an imperial pint glass , formed a big ol ' 4 '' off-white head over the cloudy dark golden brew . meringey head fades very slowly , with intricate lace tatting along the entire glass sides . aroma is a fervent mixture of spices , sweetness , funk , and what have you . taste is a bit more controlled , with a somewhat tart and spicy overall picture . also a slightly chalky close that lingers . mouthfeel is a bit prickly , what with spiciness and carbonation , but probably more or less to style , and drinkability is not so bad either . overall , my anticipation from the look and aroma overwhelmed what i got out of this flavor-wise . still a pretty nice beer though .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.40 0.40	thanks to kjyost for this one . had it on the night of oct. 13 , 2010 . poured from a 341ml . bottle . appearance : way too much foam again . second hp that does that though this one is n't as bad . dark brown head with an opaque nearly black body . smell : cocoa powder and chocolate . sweet but not cloying so . really digging the aroma . taste : where 's the sweetness ? harsh and bitter chocolate with no balance . not quite pleasant . mouthfeel : carbonation is abrasive and hinders the taste and feel of the beer though it is partially perceptible . drinkability : not particularly . one third was enough for me . overall : very odd contrast between the aroma and taste . night and day almost . not a memorable stout at all .

0.80 0.90 0.90 0.50 1.00	well , in all my years i have never poured anything like this before . half the pilsner is a very light , very clear , gold color and the other half is the head . half the pilsner is head i said ! i do not know how to grade this . i am at a loss for any analysis . i am just going to have to take a stab at looks . the smell is great . smell of very fresh hops in something that promises to be potent . as i try to pour the rest of the beer , here we go again . head out the yin-yang . am i ever going to drink this beer ? finally , the taste . not impressed . very weak . can taste the massive carbonation as if it was campaign , not beer . no aftertaste at all . very fresh . very , very drinkable , but drink a domestic light if you want a buzz . verdict : try at your own risk .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.40	i had to try this beer when the local had it on tap but i have to say i was even more disappointed than when i had the bottle . the brewery has great beers and is very creative but this one is very unbalanced on the alcohol side . i ca n't taste the malt or hops over it . the color , which is a deep gold , and the aroma are both very good . if you like alcoholy beers , try this one .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	had from on tap in tall , narrow glass . a very pleasing , dark , opaque that light had difficulty getting through . s very little smell but the slight aroma was a pleasing , coffee , chocolately one . t great , with the same qualities discovered in the aroma of chocolate , coffee and even a molasses taste . very interesting and active . also very smooth . m very distinctive . sticks to toungue and inside of mouth in the way that molasses might . it is thick without being too much so . d good because i could only have two of these since the alcohol content is 9.5 abv . it is a heavy beer too . an excellent selection for a dessert beer . a great stout .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80	pours a golden amber with a thin head that has very good retention and some of the best l ; acing i have seen on an ipa . it has a citrus , earthy and grassy herbal aroma . the taste starts out with a grassy taste that has a hint of honey in it which is than followed by some citrus ( grapefruit , lemon , and tangerine ) and finishes off with some herbal hops . the after taste is a mix of citrus and herbal hops . the mouth feel is a smooth , easy drinking creamy feel . this is one of the best ipa 's i have tasted and is a must try .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90 1.00	this represents the beginning of canned craft beer ( excluding the nitro cans from guinness , boddingtons , etc . ) and it is worthwhile . pours with a thick , spongy head and long-lasting head and settles with minor lacing . dales ' has a mildly hoppy bite and leaves little aftertaste - due to storage , i think . like any well-crafted beer , it gets better as it reaches room temperature . all-in-all , an exceptional quaff , though i do prefer oskar blues scotch ale `` old chubb . '' cheers !

0.80 0.20 0.40 0.30 0.30	11.2oz bottle into dfh shaped pint glass . a : the liquid pours a dark golden with a touch of amber beneath a thick , dense , dark tan head that slowly faded into a thick film leaving a great network of sticky lacing down the glass . s : this just smells awful , cooked vegetables all the way . its pungent smelling , with scents of old vegetable soup , corn mash , dirty grains and soggy bread . whew . t : taste follows the nose with strong notes of nasty vegetables , blaring honey sweetness , and a good dose of alcohol . the honey flavor would be pleasant if not for the sharp grain alcohol and vegetables . this tastes like a cheap malt liquor with a ton of honey and a chemical aftertaste . m : medium body , gritty mouthfeel with a sharp alcohol presence and tingly carbonation . o : pretty darn awful . the vegetable flavor wasnt as bad after a while , but i ended up pouring more than half of the bottle down the drain . avoid .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.60	pours with a dark red brown bady topped by a thick off-white head with a good amount of lace left behind . slighlty sweet malt aroma without much character . very plain and weak aroma . slightly sweet malty flavor with a strong alcohol presence and a touch of roasted coffee and licorice . the finish is full of licorice/anise . full bodied , tingling on the tongue and warming .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.50	12oz snifter , on tap at the brew kettle 's ogrefest . just my luck , right before we got there the ba 4th dim went off and this piece of crap went on . it looked decent at first . hazy reddish color with some amber and copper notes . there is a nice head and actually some lace . the appearance starts things in the right direction . the smell is also decent . there are notes of pineapple , cinnamon , wine barrel , clove and orange peel . there 's a decent sweetness from the malt , and this almost smells like a fruit candy cane . no nuttiness , which i expected given the name , but , sure , this could be a fruit cake . very unique . things fall completely apart when we get to the taste . the spices and citrus start things off . then a sickening sweet dough and rotten fruit taste creeps in . there 's some orange peel that 's out of place and some notable booze . this never even tries to come together . i seriously think this is down there with some of the worst beers i 've ever had . the beer is full bodied with some nice carbonation that makes it avoid being too syrupy . but not even a decent mouthfeel can make up for the damn taste . truly a wretched beer where it counts .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.50	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a challis..i know weird but too lazy to switch from my last beer . a - hazy honey colored . 1/2 inch of light tan head falls to a mottled skim . s - big caramel malt nose with some fruity hops . t - damn hoppy , i get the malt for a moment then quickly the hops bombard . this is the most bitter esb i 've ever had . this baby is definitely not balanced . lingering spicy and bitter . m/f - medium body , more carbonated than i would expect for an esb . d - i do n't know about this one . i seems like somebody mixed an esb with a hoppy ipa . weird , seems like a wild pitch to use a baseball analogy for me .

0.80 0.60 1.00 1.00 1.00	had this beer on tap at the rogue public house in portland . got to say this is one of my new favorites from rogue . beer is very , very drinkable , a good beer for `` domestic '' drinkers and beer advocates alike . pours golden with a very light floral aroma , pure white head . drinks with no bitter or malt after taste , great on the tongue . side note goes well with the rogue house chili as well !

0.70 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.60	12oz . bottle into a nonic . very carbonated . 3+ '' of light beige foam leaps up during the pour . oddly adjunct lager aroma detected at arms length . head slowly collapses as a rocky mishmash of shaving cream and bubble bath . lots of sticking on the glass and good retention . the beer is a very clear ambery-copper or maybe coppery-ambery . aroma is weak and watery with more of that adjunct lager character . stale malts . maybe a very small amount of herbal hops . lame . hmmm , i let this one warm up a little too much , pretty much cellar temp . still , not much flavor here . a light sweetness of honey with some grain husk and a hint of roastiness . sweet mingles nicely with the bitter on its way back and the bitterness with some late carbonation show it the way down the gullet . grain husk and bitter linger . astringence ( husk ) sticks to the cheeks a bit . all very quick and mild . mouthfeel is pretty watery with some building foam of carbonation . medium light body . i 'm sure this beer is better about 15degf colder , but i do n't get the feeling that it gets that much better . most likely the last i 'll ever have .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.80	12 oz bottle to oversized wine glass . $ 3.50 . the 2xipa made a lot of noise on the boards here which prompted me to immediately seek this brew out . first beer of the day . review from a backlog of notes . a : pours with 1 1/2 fingers of long lasting white head . verrrry light sun-struck amber orange in color . the body is clear with visual carbonation akin to angrily swarming bees . a nice amount of lacing is deposited on the glass . s & t : the nose is uncommonly weak . the flavor as well . while there is no problem with the flavor profile per se , the lack of intensity here is astounding and ratings suffer as a result . how could my palate possibly mistake a `` dipa '' at 8.2 % abv for an apa at 5 ? thanks to southern tier , i now know . light malts of caramel and biscuit with a nice squeeze of grapefruit , orange and pineapple juice . a light sweetness dials back the bitterness on the palate . m : medium to medium-full body and as creamy as it gets . visually , the carbonation seems relentless . on the tongue , however , it could n't be any softer , which in my mind , is a huge detriment . back to the pros : the flavor duration is very long and it finishes well : crisply , cleany , semi dry and moderately bitter . d : the style applied to this brew is throwing me for a loop . this would be a top notch pale ale ( if it were one ) but it loses a huge amount of points when judged as a dipa . in fact , i followed this brew with an apa ( something i would never normally do , but was more impressed with by the way ) and realized that southern tier made a silly typo : they simply forgot to put a `` 1/ '' in front of the `` 2xipa '' . despite everything negative i 've said so far , the drinkability is actually pretty high . in fact , i could drink about 450 of these things in one sitting . clearly , the abv is another misprint . unfortunately , because of the cost , i wo n't even be buying a six pack . i guess i 'll have to give this one another try next time i see it on draft .

0.20 0.70 0.60 0.60 0.20	bb 09-07 lot a. wowww what a presentation . best shaken champagne ca n't do this ! by opening this 0.5l bottle beer comming out inches high and unstopable . lost more then 30 % of the brew before i had a glass under and another 30 % ran in my beerglass before flipping the bottle . this was undrinkable so poored the remains in another glass to sample . nose is actually good ; no taste involving infection but probably some high fermenting contamination in there , at least i think . guess brewer and malter will also talk about the ingredients though ! anyway the hops still smell nice as there is obvious candysugar in and with that some decent sourness . nowhere fresh and flowery as a beer with saaz should though . no empty mouthfeel also , gon na put a claim to the brewery to inform monday . taste is drinkable ; quiet empty , dry ( against smell ) and litle sour .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.40 0.30	a : pours a great looking ruby/brown color . a two finger beige head forms and sticks around . lots of sticky lace . s : tons of fresh hops . fruit and citrus piney aromas . plenty of other fruit aromas to go around . t : like all hop bombs for me , a great aroma but as i take a sip a mouth puckering bitterness takes over . warm alcohol as well . as the beer warms , the alcohol mellows out and the flavor is a bit more balanced . though this is still a very bitter beer . m/d : a full body . slick and oily . the alcohol is very noticeable and a bitter beer makes this hard to drink . pretty much what i thought this was going to be . a boat load of bitter hops and hard to drink . its not all bad . it looks amazing with a great nose . just to bitter for me . though , if you like bigfoot this right up your ally .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70	about time i reviewed this.. been holding this bottle in the cellar for a year or so . why dont they list the batch number on 12ozers ? and why is there no bottling date ? oh well.. pours a thin , iced-tea like reddish-orange . lots of big bubbles in the body with a thin ring of residual foam . minimal lacing . nose on this beer is amazing.. very clovey and spicy with plums and orange liqueur . some yeasty age as well . flavor introduces maltiness and plays off the orange nicely . a big belgian for 7+ % , this is a nice sipper and competitively priced for such a successful belgian clone . heat is starting to mellow with a year on it , and the fruity development of the nose compliments the flavor beautifully . freshness indicated that this beer needs some time , and boy was i right . mouthfeel is n't as thin as it looks , and feels good going down . slight warming . drinkability suffers due to big flavor and a slight excess of alcoholiness for the abv.. otherwise a nice brew that all new englanders should be proud of .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.60	appearence : pale gold beneath a tiny , quickly dissapearing white head . good clairty , very little carbonation . smell : smells like adjunct-laden shit water , but it says it 's all grain ? whatever . taste and mouthfeel : as far as light beers go , this one 's damn tasty . stack this up to any other craft beer , it 's shitty . watered-down cereal flavor . that 's it . drinkability and overall : hey , it 's better than a coors light .

0.40 0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60	picked up a 750 of `` surly bird '' expecting the same type of tasteful yet adventurous experience i 've had from the other de proef flemish wild ale products ( pig nun , spoon whacker , etc . ) a little difficult to get the synthetic cork out -- as i poured into a chalice , i found why -- pretty darn flat . little to no head , like amber water . color a dark amber . massive amounts of sediment as i reached the bottom of the bottle . smell was quite tart -- before the first sip i braced myself for the sharp bite the gueuze offerings i 've tried -- not there , though . nor did i catch the smooth dynamic barnyard flavors i expected . yes , the grass , hay etc . were all there , but with a slightly off slightly sour bend . am really wondering , as many of the other reviewers noted a good head on the brew , if i did not get a bad bottle ? hate to risk my money on another , though , as there are so many great ( and consistient ) belgians out there .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60	on tap at the brewpub . a : light straw and very cloudy with little head or carbonation . s : bubblegum of course . very sweet and strong . t : good banana flavor at first that progresses into a thin , soapy finish . this is definitely this brew 's biggest flaw , a total nose dive halfway through the palate that leaves me less than tempted for another swig . m : medium body with a bitter and dry finish . d : fairly average and to style . refreshing and summery ( despite its flavor problems ) . not a horrible beer to have on a summer afternoon while chasing the shade in lander , but imo there are better brews at the lander bar than this one .

0.60 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.90	a : dark body and lighter at the edges . s : was more aromatic once it warmed up to drinking temp . a flat beer smell of malts and an acrid berry . t : hm , like bitter berries or , as someone else said , almost green olive . bitterness is profound at the end without the hoppy payoff . m : first thing i feel is carbonation . a lot of it . medium body and feels smooth . d : for some reason , i liked the overall of the beer , but did not particularly care for the taste . goes down well with bitter bite and belching afterwards .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 1.00	drank it on draft at legacy and at reading country club i have also had three cases of it made for them by the lion in bottles it is smooth favorful light and not biteing , nice head great smell very refreshing to drink it is a amazing product that they have made it is very nice to just sit and drink again and again . the draft and bottled are so close in taste it is amazing . it is a terrific beer and a great thing to have reading beer back and to have it better by far then the original ! drank the old reading beer when i was young . i like it very much and am going to get 3 more cases very soon ! dave

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.90 0.80	this is a very good doppelbock . i 'm usually not a huge fan of the style , but i figured we 're coming up on bock season , so it 's as good a time as any to get a few more under my belt ( and you never know when your tastes will change ) . i like weihenstephaner quite a bit , so this was definitely among my top picks to try . the beer pours to a dark nutty brown color with amber hues . it may be very dark , but when held to the light , it displays a great clarity . an active carbonation maintains a nice crisp tan head . hardly leaves a single sud of lace on the glass . the smell is kind of a weak point . the only aroma i can pick up are the vegetal aspects of lager yeast that i often do n't enjoy . stewed carrots and peas , creamed corn . ick . the taste , on the other hand , is very good , and it makes up for the unpleasant nose . it has a very nice depth to the malt character without being too rich and `` muddy . '' just a gentle sweetness , almost even a little more on the dry side of the scale . fairly chocolatey with some caramel and toffee . light usage of german noble hops provide a nice backing . the alcohol is fairly well concealed , but it does add to the flavor profile a bit . the vegetal flavors are next to nonexistent on the palate , thankfully . the body is medium . very crisp . the flavors wash away quite clean as well , leaving only a gentle lingering of the spicy hops and chocolate . quite an enjoyable drink , aside from the unfortunate nose .

0.50 0.90 0.70 0.80 0.80	it says red ale on the bottle , but this is n't red ! it 's orange . . . and it has no head to speak of ! what have i gotten myself into here . is this a bad bottle ? the sniff tells me it 's not skunky and in fact pretty sweet . the taste backs that up . very nice . a sweet alcohol taste controls the flavors that follow which include caramel and vanilla . it also has a slight earthy tone to it towards the end . hops hold the sweet alcohol together . finishes with an apple sweetness . the only problem was that it was a little too thin , other that that i liked this beer a lot .

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.60	appearance - nice amber color . no head when poured into pint glass.carbonation is very light to almost none existent . scent - almost also non-existent . a faint carmel aroma . taste - it tastes more carbonated then it looks . a smooth floral taste with the hops being only slight in taste though though the flavor they provide seems to built up with every sip . mouthfeel - smooth with only a hint of aftertaste . while i like beers that are a bit more on the `` heavy '' side of flavor , this is a very refreshing beer . i even found myself taking the glass out to my patio where it seemed to `` fit '' for a hot summer afternoon .

0.90 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.80	paid $ 8.99 for a 4 pack of 12 oz bottles from discount liquor in milwaukee , wi . i pour into a small snifter to review . as stated on the side of the bottle : a few times a year we will cut dan loose to brew whatever he chooses , uncensored , uncut , unplugged . always handcrafted , the bottle you hold is brewed for the adventurous soul . this is a very limited edition and we make no promises to ever brew this style again . english aristocracy flaunted their wealth saving barley wines for exclusive friends . our iced barley wine is an intense brew of 28.5 degrees plato og . frozen in the cellars over a powerful twelve week fermentation . you hold an elegant riot of bittersweet sherry and dark fruit earthy notes . warm and expansive it will fill your senses . great for contemplative sipping now or lay down for an elegant occasion with friends . onto my own review : poured as aggressive as possible to get a quarter inch white head consistent of very small bubbles that dissipate quickly . minimal carbonation . mysterious dark ruby red color when held to light . still transparent with no sediment . some ok lacing . the lack of alcohol in the nose is intriguing for this hefty 13.5 % abv barleywine . sweet and complex , i am getting a variety of aromas with this one . candied apple , red licorice , aged oak wood , fig , raisin , brown sugar and molasses . great smelling sweet medicinal syrup . i begin to taste at 50f . it really awakens the senses with full on flavor . here its booziness comes out more and it really is quite warming . very medicinal with candied apples dominating . many of the intricacies of the nose become hidden in the taste . i am nearing the end of the beer at 59f and flavors are not becoming more intense as what often happens with a ris for example . the mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing . very flat and uncarbonated . pretty dry and a quick finish . a moderate graininess is left behind in the mouth . this is a nice sipper and would make a great dessert beer . i ca n't wait to try this one again in a couple years out of my cellar ; i have a feeling it really is going to age well .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70	pours a medium gold with a huge off-white head . medium carbonation bubbles . aroma is of canned corn , tin can , and earthy , grassy hops . taste is way different than aroma ! malty backbone rides in a peppery-grassy hops finish and a soft dryish mouthfeel . a middle of the road anytime easy quaffer .

0.60 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.60	deep brown/chocolate lab color with hints of mahogany as the light hits it . khaki colored head that ran away as soon as i stopped pouring , had it lingered it would of been nice . smells of almond , and booze , though it isnt a big beer . definatley sweet smelling but not overly pungent . bland ! holly crap i was expecting more , dont know why but what a let down when it hits the toungue . as it warms it gets a bit better with the almond smell coming through in the taste . not as sweet as it smelled . light body , not much to it . do n't bother , i 'm sure you have had this beer before with different packaging . edit : so after reviewing i noticed it was euro dark lager , not the style i expected perhaps this is more to its style then i let on . i beleive this is the first of this style i have ahd so perhaps it is my lack of knowledge not the beers lack of personality . still say skip it .

0.50 0.90 0.80 0.80 0.90	rye and smoke ? count me in . poured into a snifter . 2010 vintage . 2.5 a : black color . less than one finger of short lived light brown head . no lacing . 4.5 s : smells delicious ! smells like a smoked pig wrapped in bacon . the smoke in this could n't be much more enticing . molasses and caramel underneath . i ca n't really pick up on any of the rye . the smoke covers it up like it covers up everything else . 4.0 t : i really like this . perfect amount of smoke that manifests in porcine flavors . the base beer pulls through in a much bigger way than in the nose . lots of caramel , molasses , and a sweet booziness that is commonly found in doppelbocks . very nice . 4.0 m : heavier medium body . good moderate carbonation . reasonably creamy with a good smoothness . 4.5 d : i enjoyed this quite a bit . a couple categories could have been a bit higher , so thus a higher score here . great balance between the smoke and the doppelbock .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.60	12 oz bottle , dated `` bottled on oct 28 , 2010 '' . yes , i 'm reviewing a pale ale that is almost 11 months old , but not my fault . i just bought this variety case a week ago , and was burned by great divide not putting dating on the outer case . appears hazy orangish color , with big rocky white colored head . it does smell a bit stale , a little cardboardish . taste seems fine , about in-line for an english pale ale- malty with just a touch of hops to balance . medium body , higher carbonation .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.70	light gold , cloudy , looks like a wheat beer . strongly flavoured nose with herbs and nettles . powerful and sweet palate but seem a bit alcohol driven and fraction disjointed . finishes with a lick of cinamon . a little disappointing to be honest given the reputation .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.70	not much nose except for a smidge of sweetness . deep purple color with a light brown 1/2 inch sticky laced head . sweet chewy caramel taste . the brew is quite sweet with a bitterness to the finish that helps to round the sweetness . it does not completely do the job though.. and the beer is still left on the sweet side . this is a caramel chew for you ! drink it after a meal as a treat .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured from growler into imperial nonic glass . growler courtesy of trade with ba user commis ! appearance : moderate pour down the center of the glass gives a little less than 2 fingers of a nice whitish head , but the head fades very quickly . lacing is there as the beer goes down , but minimal . gorgeous orange color makes for a very inviting looking brew - the color is probably my favorite characteristic of this beer . smell : malt and flowers , some pine . not getting the citrusy blast that i like from an ipa , but otherwise pleasant enough . taste : really good . well balanced , and more of the bitter piney and bread-y east coast flavor up front than the west coast appearance would suggest to me . some sweet malt on the back end . mouthfeel : well carbonated , medium body . hits the mark for the style . drinkability : high . the 7.5 % alcohol is on the high side for the style , but very well hidden , and thus this beer goes down easily . it 's a potentially dangerous combination though , as a few pints of this ipa will sneak up on you . overall : very good ipa for those who prefer balance over hop bombs . well worth tasting if you have the opportunity , but not necessary to go out of your way for .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.80	the color is a bit light but it has a decent head . the carbonation is also light . it has a great aroma . lots of sweet malt , floral notes , and honey . the aroma and the taste go hand in hand . it 's a little too sweet , but still good . i also get a slight undertone of cloves . the finish is very clean and light . a good ale that could use a bit of hops in the end to even out the sweetness . but a good choice .

0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90 0.90	six-pack from woodmans in kenosha , about $ 11 . clear , medium brown brew , very little head . smells like ... a weizenbock . banana , clove , some alcohol . tastes great , banana and clove and some breadiness . alcohol helps clean it up , and you feel it . still smelling the empty glass , i would swear this was a weizenbock if i did n't know it was n't ( or is it ? ) . highly recommend .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.50 0.60	that took a while . website only in dutch ! ! interesting find here . flavored with bog myrtle ( aka sweet gale ) . pours an effervescent and hazy gold , with nice , creamy head , lot 's o ' lace , and decent carbonation . the nose is beautiful . i get the belgian yeastiness , and something akin to peaches served with a dash of allspice . so far it 's awesome . flavor is wacky . big hit of that allspice flavor - must be the bog myrtle . strong bitterness from the yeast ( i think ) detracts from what is a very special flavor initially . evolves into a wonderful , spicy flavor . the bitterness is holding me back from loving this , however , along with a metallic , almost oxidized flavor on the finish . very dry , too . $ 2.99 per 11.16 oz . bottle , so the price makes it worth trying . if this were fresh on tap i bet it 'd be awesome .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	tallboy into an unfortunately frosted pint glass . reviewed from notes . pours a clear burnt copper - i 'm pretty sure sherman-williams calls this `` ochre . '' a half-finger white head does n't last for too long , but leaves soapy lacing around the glass . the aroma is pretty nice , and only improved as the beer and glass warmed . very piney and grassy , with a good citrus kick underneath . smells very clean , fresh . the taste is surprisingly sweet . the malt dominates whatever hops are left in the mix , though there 's a bitter bite in the finish . an interesting spice mix going on here , it 's a touch floral . i have a feeling this is n't the freshest of cans . undercarbonated mouthfeel only heightens my suspicions re : this beer 's age . this is pretty dead , though not undrinkable . pretty mediocre all around , though i 'd love to try a fresh can . knowing how good this beer tastes on tap only exacerbates the sting . i 'll be on the lookout for an opportunity to re-rate .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.80	a - opaque yellow pear . almost no head . s - mild , effervescent cider . t - pear , little champaign , light wheat . flavor drops off at the end with almost no after taste , just a little residual booze . m - almost flat , with a very light body . d - mild and very drinkable .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	brew poured to a brown color but your able to see through it , has a medium sized light tan head that had very limited retention . no lacing to speak of . the aroma seems to be pretty good , nice strong malt scent that gives off the idea of caramel also giving a sweet smell . the taste is a letdown imo , the malt scent does not carry over to the taste . seems very watery , what is there reminds me a bit of caramel but also finishes a little odd . has a sweet flavor and has a slight hop ending . this brew was a let down , i enjoy schwarzbier very much but imo this just did not meet the cut . i feel that there are many other offerings that are much better than this one .

0.40 0.20 0.50 0.50 0.20	the first time i had this , i was camping with a bunch of friends and when my one friend showed up with the beer , we didnt expect to see him buy this . natty ice is just like coors ( garbage ) that gets you messed up faster . for the price he paid , he got 3 30 packs for the price of a case of stouts golden lager ( good beer ) . i was dissapointed that night .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.50	served in a three floyds tulip pint glass . thanks to taiyed for sharing this bottle ! part one of the swillfest 2011 after-party . it pours a dark ruby-tinted brown topped by a finger of tan foam . the nose comprises chocolate-covered pretzels , light roasted malts , blueberries , black grapes , balsa , and juniper berries . the taste holds notes of dark chocolate , rubber , vinyl , pine-sol , molasses , and menthol . whoa , what happened here ! ? the body is a rather light medium , with a light moderate carbonation and a scratchily dry finish . overall , a nice-looking and -smelling beer , but it just tastes downright awful to me .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	appearance : with a pull off top which is neat . poured into a flute is a pale clear golden beer with about two fingers worth of head . aroma : a little bit of floral hops . grassy , with a touch of grain . not too much in the malt section mostly bready if anything . taste : carbonation is not too bad but a little on the thin side . a slight bit of a buttery texture on the palate . grassy bits with bits of grain . malts are there but do not offer much more than a bit of breadiness . notes : overall this is not too bad a bit thin but still decent . cheers .

0.90 0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90	thanks to cptierney for getting this into my hands via an in house trade . he 'd told me about this beer for quite a while , saying that i had , had , had to try it out . as a lover of browns , porters and stouts ... he knew this would be right up my alley when i wanted something new ... and good god was he right . this beer pours with the look of a solid porter . deep brown with a light tan head that sticks around for a while . my glass was freshly rinsed , so the head retention may have been negatively affected by that , but there was not much retention to speak of . smells of malts ... malts , malts and more malts ... to be completely honest , this beer smells like the mash tun on brew day ... and i love it ! that 's not to say that it 's overly sweet though . i would assume that enough dark ... maybe chocolate malts are used to balance this out . really enjoyable flavor that changes from the moment it hits your lips to 5 minutes after you swallowed your last sip . perfectly carbonated , i get a faint tingle from the floor to the roof of my mouth as i take it in . medium body that really leaves a nice coating behind . really enjoyable . this is one of the most drinkable beers i 've ever had in my life . lower in abv and higher in taste and overall enjoyability ... that 's coming from one who enjoys big beers much more than their counterpart ... i really like this beer .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	had this at the cloverleaf tavern in west caldwell , nj , where they constantly have it on tap . a : pours a nice , amber body with a small , white head that had decent retention . starts to dissipate about halfway through it , but slowed to a nice lacing . s : a pleasant mix of malts and hops . maybe hints of grapefruit or some other sweet , citrus fruit . t : the taste was a nice mix of the sweet malts and the bitter hops . there was more hop bitterness in the aftertaste however . m : a decent , full-bodied mouthfeel . smooth as silk . d : ok drinkability . the high abv and the bitterness may get to you later , but i could see myself probably drinking a sixer of this without a problem . the malts do a good job to balance the high hop content of the beer , making it a smooth drink and refreshing .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.50 0.50	received in a trade for some hopslam ; thanks , drew ! poured into a pint glass , this beer had a nice golden body with a thin white head . aroma is of hops , sugar and vanilla . full bodied creamy and syrupy mouthfeel . this beer is mostly sweet and overly oaky with an almost cloying finish that has very little hop bitterness . i appreciate the brewer 's intent with the oak and low bitterness to make this taste more authentic as if the barrel had sailed for months , however it just was n't my cup of tea . i do n't think i 'll be having this one again soon .

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	a-pitch black with a nice tan head that thins s-chocolate , red wine , licorice , and black pepper . strong and complex ! possibly some ginger in there too . t-comes in with a boozy taste of pepper and licorice . then comes a heavy underlying bitterness with an after-taste of slightly dark roasted belgian malts with some ginger . definitely a boozy and complex beer m-heavy , thick , and syrupy . low carbonation . dry finish o-i love this beer . as big as it as , i enjoyed all 750ml to myself . definitely something i 'd buy again if given the chance . i think next time , i would like to share it though

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.70	poured a glass of this from one of the three bottle i picked up at green 's a few weeks ago . pours a deep brown/black color . very good looking head on top of it . head is very sweet smelling . taste is a little less balanced than i thought it would be . alot of coffee and pretty damn bitter to boot . a thick , creamy mouthfeel . a good coffee brew , but not the best i 've ever had .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.60	a = golden amber in the glass , slightly translucent , with a thinner head , but plentiful lacing in the glass . s = aroma on the whole is slightly sweet and malty , but little else comes from the aroma . it is near odorless of hops , which i find puzzling . t = medium bitterness but well balanced by the honey-like sweetness and very light citrus notes that kicks in very quickly . a fair amount of dark chocolate in the finish , though it does not linger long on the palate.. but where are the hops that it advertises ? there are barely any that i could detect . here i was disappointed . the tag said that they crammed as many hops as they physically could into the copper , but i did not detect much m = thinner than i would expect , but not to the point of being watery . there is still some resinous feel on the tongue , and the bubbles are subtle . d = overall , this brew is subtle in nature , but lacks character with only having sweetness and a surprising finish . however , it is the transition from sweetness to this finish that offers a pleasant surprise . this is its greatest strength , but also is the greatest weakness of the brew . overall , i was not impressed with this brew being representative of the ipa style , even by english standards of putting less hops than the american counterparts . . it was far too sweet and grossly under-hopped .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.80	a highly drinkable beer . nothing really offensive about it . pours a decent head without lacing . the smell is slightly skunky and also pours an oft-red color . taste is pretty grainy and smooth , not well balanced as there are really not any hops to speak of . but nonetheless , a decent highly drinkable beer .

0.70 0.20 0.60 0.40 0.40	the beer looks good enough with a light gold body with a little white head , but this beer reeks of plastic and cholorphenols . the flavor at least has some pale malted barley and wheat in the aftertaste , but plastic and cleaning chemical notes are way too strong . the mouthfeel is crisp and light , but the drinkability suffers from the flaws . if this beer was contract brewed for me , i 'd be pissed . i have n't come across a beer flawed this badly in a long time . avoid .

0.80 0.50 0.30 0.80 0.70	a - a deep red beer with a fairly large foamy head . the slightly pink head lingers for a few minutes and leaves thin sheats of lacing down the sides . looks good for a cherry lambic . s - strong ripe red cherries over cinnamon , cloves and nutmeg . t - there is more spice than cherries . cloves , cinnamon , allspice and nutmeg . there is then a sour cherry flavor . the aftertaste is simply a lingering tart cherry . not bad , and not very sweet either . m - extremely thin and fizzy . this is really like soda water . not even that refreshing . i swirled it violently to lower the carbonation - it did n't affect much . d - alright . cherry lambics are pretty common and generally better than this one . i wo n't have it again , but if your idea of the perfect lambic is a sour cherry soda , than hunt this down . it is easy to drink and i got through it with ease .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	22oz bottle , sam adams perfect pint , nearly opaque , the color is appropriate and tinged more with red and purple than yellow . the head was small and of a normal medium brown with lackluster stickage . uh huh , this smells like a chocolate stout . outdistancing young 's famous brew , the chocolate is dark , shot through with french roast coffee swimming in sugar . hershey 's syrup with a little more refinement seems close . not a particularly great stout is the base . not a large roast character , but what 's there is slightly acrid and even so this is a sweet beer . the lush coffee and chocolate are still there ; they pretty much constitute the whole . it 's thin , any way you cut it , it 's thin . medium high carbonation . another one of trader joe 's deals here . aroma is better than flavor .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	a- clear , golden body with a white fluffy head the fades to a lasting ring . has a little bit of stick to the sides of the glass . s- light malt and a much more dominate hop aroma . pretty tame overall though . t- nice bready malt flavors jump out at first . then lasting hop flavors come in . they create a nice bitterness and a dry finish . although there are a lot of hop flavors , it 's still pretty balanced overall . m- medium body that is slightly creamy at first but is crisp and clean on the finish . d- pretty easy drinking for a bock beer . the flavors are simple and well-balanced ; making it pretty drinkable for me .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.50	a : pale straw and crystal clear . moderate white head with little lacing . s : not much of anything . a hint of corn and cereal grain . t : again , not much to go on . but what is there is balanced . no off flavors . m : very light and dry . high carbonation . o : about as light as it gets . and sometimes that 's a good thing .

0.60 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.50	kasteel cru bottle into grolsch pint glass . reviewed live in cork . a : two finger head of no cream - pretty thin , and of poor retention . clear light pink colour . appealing . sm : berry hop esters - a very light scent . t : light berry taste - very grape , almost like rose wine . pretty one note . i 'm new to the style , which seems very wine wannabe . i suppose for emulating champagne in a beer manner , it does what it 's supposed to . it 's one note , which makes it intrinsically balanced . very simple . mf : light fizzy sparkling feel , matching the flavours . this beer has serious wine envy . dr : hides its 5 % abv quite well , but is ultimately too expensive for its quality and simplicity to justify a purchase . it 's more a rose/champagne sparkling wannabe than a true beer .

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.50 0.50	they cant all be winners or appeal to everyone . this beer is really not up my alley . the beer is wonderful to look at and has a very nice robust and scotch like in complexity nose . the taste is what killed this one for me and the fact that it has almost no carbonation.did i get a bad beer ? the most overwhelming flavour here was port , vinegar and oak , . not completely unpleasant but not worth finishing . there were cherry tones in there too as i think about it . i had high hopes for this one . i can not recommend it .

0.70 0.30 0.70 0.50 0.60	pours yellow . big head . smells awful . over the top foul cheap brewing products . not much else but a mess of badness . tastes a little better . just plain lager . so much more than many other macros though . there is a body to this beer . this is pbr 's saving grace . still pretty bad

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60	capped 750 with no dates purchased at whole foods in ann arbor and poured into a pilsener . bottle # 447 with a neck tag explaining the ingredients and story behind the beer . signed by proprietor and jedi brewmaster , joe short . tons of foam despite a careful pour . underneath the gargantuan head of white is a bright gold beer with plenty of carbonation , duh . plenty of pils malt and tons of spicyness from the amarillo hops . this is an odd yet very pleasing combo . simple yet bold yet bold in its own way . i keep sniffing and sniffing ... lots of pils malt upfront than the hops jump in and dry things out with a little spice . picture a race car driver shifting gears too fast . things were going just fine until the hop bomb blew up and wrecked any chance this beert had for balance . a hop head would like this , but i 'm not a big fan of this sudden and drastic change of direction . too much amarillo . the mouth starts off moderate but turns too dry and bitter for me . i wo n't be dropping another $ 16 for this one .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	drank from a 12 fluid ounce bottle purchased at liquor world , cambridge , ma best by november 2008 poured a near black with brown edges when held to the light . the creamy , bubbly , cocoa-colored head quickly faded to a thin , wispy film with a thick ring of froth . the aroma was amazing , especially for a beer of such humble stature . chocolatey rich to the extreme . steaming hot fudge instantly came to mind . sweet and creamy with strong notes of vanilla and a touch of oak . the taste was deeper and roastier than the aroma . dark chocolate came through strong up front . black coffee was noticeable in the center . a touch oaky and smoky . the bitter , deep roast , espresso-like finish lingered on and on . initially , i detected some metallic notes in the finish , but these died down as the beer warmed . mouthfeel was medium bodied with a fine , somewhat lively carbonation . a touch thinner than expected . frothy and slightly creamy on the palate . this was a smooth and tasty beer with an aroma that was to die for . at 5.7 % abv , this porter was surprisingly drinkable . definitely one of the more impressive examples of the style i have tried in a while .

0.80 0.80 0.30 0.50 0.40	bottle poured into a snifter a few times over a couple hours , purchased on a tip from a ba buddy . i tried to hold out on drinking this alone , but nobody bit so here goes , vermonster , a dark brown barleywine that looks like it means business , a deep dark brown that sheds some lighter colors ( burnt red ) up to a light . a nice pillow like condensed dark tan head raises a inch , looking scrumptious . it dies , but is brought back with swirls , loose spider web lacing , weak legs . the name implies a monster and rock art brings it on the nose with caramel , dark malts , toffee and some faint dark fruits with extensive warming . with 135ibu 's running through this , piney resiny hops burst through with vigor . a faint sense of alcohol as well , but that 's expected in this style . the taste takes a dwindle in score because it 's brought down by the feel which is lacking . all the barleywine qualities are there but they could be boosted a hell of a lot more with a bigger body , but i digress . tastes include caramel , toffee , nuts . muted hops with pine , not so much citrus , and a dash of strong alcohol in this 10 % er . the alcohol does not bother me , it 's well hidden . the feel on this is a bummer and the worst part of this monster . when vermonster 1st entered my palete , i was like this is going to be good , then i swirled it around in my mouth and i noticed that the hop kick of 135ibu 's was muted , then when i swallowed it , i started to scratch my head . the beer looks healthy and alive in appearance but is dead flat in feel . after 10oz 's or so i started to shake my head . dare i say the weakest feel in a barleywine ever , dissapointing . also had a muddy feel on the way down and a very watery . it 's taking away from what should be a great bwine . the drinkability should be higher but i can not justify it . i will say that the 2nd half of the bottle was better and a bit fuller when some of the dregs made it 's way into the glass . the yeast helped to liven things up a bit . i should of just dumped the 1st half and worked with the 2nd half . i 'll try it again down the road and revise if i see fit as i see that another reviewer from pa had the same problem in feel . this monster was not scary at all , it did not even startle me .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80 0.70	a : poured into my new belgium goblet with not too much head and it settled pretty quick.left a nice lacing though . honey colored and cloudy s : really not much to the nose at all at least when it 's cold . t : lemony ! really what i have to say is this is the best wheat beer i 've had . m : pleny of carbonation , and a little bit of a citrus bite d : mildy drinkable . could drink more than a few of these , but otoh wont go out of my way to find it again .

0.30 0.30 0.60 0.50 0.60	i 'm surprised a beer this outstanding is n't already in the system and i feel privledged to add it ( huge sarcasim in that sentence ) ..i 'm not sure if it is classified as a ice lager or light lager..i guessed light.. light straw colored ... no head retention ... very little aroma but some hints of sweetness rather than hops which is different than regular `` lite '' if i remember correctly..not a lot of flavor ... goes down easy and no bad `` off '' tastes which for a beer like this is a definite positive..does have just a bit of that ice/alcohol flavor but not as strong as some of the other `` ice 's '' i 've had ... this is not a terrible beer ... it 's drinkable , and i guess for a light it 's at least average ...

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.80 0.80	nice pour ... little head . i smell burnt & licorice . not too happy to start . nice mouthfeel pretty smooth . wow ... this is some light stuff for the color . good taste though . i have to hand it to magic hat ... they packed some flavor into this really light beer . you can drink this all night long , but i doubt you will hand one to your bud and say '' bro , you got ta try this , it will knock your socks off '' . it 's pretty good , not great , but good . the abv is appropriate for the feel on this one . i had this back to back with avery 's new world porter . not a good move , cuz that one packs a whollop . if you pair this with a bad ass beer it will not stand . on it 's own , you should have a pretty good time ...

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.60	remember the choklat by southern tier ? well , as mentioned before , that is one of five beers in southern tier 's blackwater series of imperial stouts . the first that i tried , and maybe most ridiculous of them all is the creme brulee milk stout . this is a beer that really redefines what flavors can exist in beer . yes , the choklat was brewed with swiss chocolate and does has immense bittersweet chocolate flavors and aromas pouring throughout it . but try the creme brulee stout and you will see what i mean . it has been brewed with vanilla beans to give it a desert like vanilla sweetness , lactose sugar for added smooth character and a sugary sweet body , and among other malts , dark caramel malt . i expect this was the largest portion of the malt used because this beer literally smells and tastes exactly like a creme brulee . i 've said ridiculous once already , but it 's just ridiculous . really , unless you 've had this beer before , you have never had anything like it . the guys at southern tier are some of my favorite brewers , and they describe the creme brulee stout it so well themselves that i have to reiterate it here : '' we are not the harbingers of truth as some may suggest but it may indeed be argued that our brewing philosophy is tantamount to a dessert with a bellicose past . how , you may ask , would a brewery determine a likeness to hard-coated custard ? our response is simple ; it 's all in the power of history , and of course , the extra finesse needed to top off a contentious treat with definition . by comprehending the labyrinthine movement of time , one would not think it strange to trace the errant path of an ordinary object such as a cream dessert only to discover that it has been the cause of cultural disputes since the middle ages . the british founders of burnt cream and from spain , crema catalana , both stand by their creative originality and we respect that , but it was the french crme brle , amid the strife of contention , that survived to represent our deliciously creamy brew . '' history and finesse may have come together to create this beer , but i have come to drink it ! while it may sound like desert , it does pack a punch at 9.2 % abv . it is after all in the imperial stout series . but fret not , this beer knows exactly how to handle the power . pour this big stout from its 650ml bottle into a nice deep chalice with a slight tulip to catch some of the aromas . it will flow out thick and smooth showing an oil like consistency building a black monstrous beer with a mocha tan head . the foam is dense but short and will live only for a few minutes before it fades to a soft film on the jet black beer . into the light the stout shows but a glimpse of color ; amber browns glimmer , but shadows take over with deep oily black waves as the light fades . the nose is my favorite thing about this beer , more so than the taste even . it 's just straight creme brulee with a mild alcoholic , almost cognac finish . i 'm not exaggerating either . its it packed with deep caramel , butterscotch , touches of toffee , vanilla , creme , warm butter , a hint of smoke and roast , and finishes with a warm aged spirit sensation . when i first had a bottle of this i finished it , but never cleaned the bottle - i kept it to reserve the scent to show and amaze my friends . seriously ! so i was pretty excited by this point and could n't wait to get into this beer . i served it at cellar temperature ( 14c , 57f ) anticipating a lasting brew that would gradually warm in temperature and flavor . its a bit of a rush when you first let the stout in your mouth . massive caramel malts and vanilla crash down on your tongue and flood your palate with rich flavors . for a second all i can get it sweet caramel , toffee and power , but soon vanilla , butterscotch and bitter chocolate make their way across your cheeks and fill every cavity . smoke and roasted malts are manifesting themselves on my palate now as the beer warms a touch , and more bitter chocolate begins to show itself . soft hop bitterness can be found in the back , but is severely dominated by candied vanilla , caramelized sugar , roast and heavy sweet malts . the finish is wamring and cognac like as the nose depicted , and overall alcohol is somewhat apparent in smooth light heat . it is definitely a treat , but would be very difficult to finish 22oz to myself . it is not as balanced as the choklat , and is also a bit more brash . overall i think the choklat is the better beer , but the creme brulee stout is the crown pleaser , and certainly makes a bigger statement .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.50	a- finger of off white head . red at bottom of glass and gets lighter towards the top . the rocky head dissipates just a bit and clears way for bubbles . s- grape soda , rasberry jam , sour , fruity lambic . t- hoppy burn but sour . hits back of tounge and washes/settles to the front . kind of a backwards effect ! very fizzy and grape . this beer will hit your nose as much as your mouth . tastes like acidic , citrus fruit juices after brushing your teeth . very interesting but not too pleasant . m- i think this is a little too carbonated ... to the point of fizzy . this settles in the weirdest , backwards way . thin mouth feel . d- i do n't think i will be purchasing this again . it 's drinkable in the sense that you ca n't taste any booze at all but it 's not drinkable in the sense that it 's fizzy and too acidic .

0.60 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.60	appearance : crystal-clear yellow color , with a smallish white head . aroma : sweet and cornish , what there is of it , typical lagery smell , with only the faintest whiffs of citrus , flowers . on palate : sweet , clean , brisk , and actually kind of tasty . light body . absolutely no finish , it vanishes as soon as you realized that it was there ! texture , what there is , dies quickly , too . a simple sweetness resides in the back of the throat , until it croaks , too . sweetness continues , to the point of unpleasantness . i do like sweetness in a beer , yes , but only when accompanied by hops , malt , body , texture , taste , etc . mouthfeel , body , everything is quite forgettable . that serves some people fairly well , but not i . not that bad , actually , just not very good . and , lucky me , i chose a pint can to sample . wee , wee , wee , all the way home !

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90	appearance : dark brown with ruby hue . huge frothy head with in credible head retention and lacing . smell : about all i smell is sweet malts with a tinge of a metallic smell . taste : maltly scotch ale goodness . lingering sweet malts on the back of the tongue . mouthfeel : moderate carbonation and watery mouthfeel . drinkability : it 's an easy drinker . definitely not the huge malt bomb that other scoth ales are - so much easier to drink . good mild scoth ale . 60 schillings maybe ?

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.50	1pt.9oz . bottle purchased at enoteca in post falls , idaho , for $ 8.99 a couple of months ago . `` batch 158 , '' according to the label , which also states it was brewed on `` 08.05.08 . '' and is best before `` 08.05.10 . '' whether the 8 means august 5th or may 8th , this is officially beyond the best by date . kinda wished i 'd noticed it before now . incidentally , the label also states this is a `` dark porter . '' now i have friends in norway , and have tremendous respect for their nation 's ingenuity , but does this mean the norwegians have created a new variety of beer called a light porter ? pours a dark , dense color that could be either brown or black . holding it up to the light makes no difference except for an almost imperceptible rubyish tinge to the extremities of the beer . 1/3 of an inch of tan foam was initially at the top of this beer , but it soon receded to a foam ring . this beer smells of dark fruit , molasses and bourbon . the latter comes as a surprise given that the label only claims an abv percentage of 6.5 . was this aged in whiskey casks ? there 's certainly no mention of it on the label , and that 's the kind of thing that is normally trumpeted to the skies . very acidic tasting beer . the dark fruit and molasses scents do n't translate very well to the taste . weird , and not pleasantly so . surprisingly watery body and dry , prickly mouthfeel for a porter , `` dark '' or otherwise . not too impressed with this . while it is entirely possible this beer suffers due to its age , the reviews of fresher bottles do n't seem too great , either . i think i 'll pass this up in the future .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.70	pours copper-brown with a large fading head . nose shows loads of treacle fudge and brown sugar with cloves showing in the background . some soft perfumy alcohol shows . similarly sweet malty flavours but there 's also a harsh chalky and alcoholic note that detracts from the experience . carbonation is ridiculously high .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	this poured a clean pale straw color with a somewhat watery body and almsot no head . minimal carbonation . the nose came off as slightly malty , floral hoppy and a definite contribution from yeast . the taste was a good kick of alcohol up front , very sweet malt and a lot of hoppiness , but sweet moreso than bitter . little hint of honey in there as well . the feel was good ; a biting hop plus a sweet malty presence changing quickly to an almost watery feel ( unexpected ) then comes around with a tongue-coating buttery aftertaste . very good . overall this was a great beer but the alcohol was a bit much in volume and especially in taste . still something to try and another great variation from st .

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70	can into pint glass a - big 2 finger eggshell head , slightly hazy medium orange/brown coloring on the beer , relatively large bubbles s - quite robust hops and citrus control the doughy scent , surprisingly bold smell t - bready start transforms smoothly to a citrus to a bitter and a slightly sour finish . almost like taking a bite of sourdough . something seems to be off-balance . m - upper moderate to high carbonation works nicely to maintain the overall middle ground mouthfeel d - i like it , but not that interested in another a good beer that can be improved upon

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	03/16/09- purchased at ledger 's in berkeley , ca . presentation- 6oz nip sized bottle 2005 limited edition bottling . poured into my jw lees glass . appearance- brown-brandy/congac-like appearance . slight bubbly head upon pour . ultra light watery and spotty lace . smell- nice nose of hard alcohol , vanilla , deep caramel and barrel flavors . taste- either this one has n't sat long enough , or a bit too long . it tasted fine , but the flavors with a bit muted . some caramel , but a bit watery combined with a touch of vanilla and a oaky like flavor . mouthfeel- not really as thick as expected . a bit watery , but smooth . short lived aftertaste . easy to consume though . drinkability- tasted fine , but was hoping for something in the great to excellent range . better than average , but not much above that .

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.60 0.80	appearance : pours very dark with a creamy just off white nitro head . i got to say that when it comes to classy looking beers ... this one takes the cake , it literally pours perfect every time . smell : veeeery faint roasted malts , maybe the slightest bit of burnt chocolate . taste : taste is dominated by roasted malts , they are very faint though . there is a touch of bitterness from some mild hops toward the finish of this beer . mouthfeel : extremely light , but slightly viscous . drinkability : this beer finishes very quickly and is much tastier than drinking a low calorie american adjunct while beating most of them in calories . not great but i can drink these all day long .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.90	12oz bottle poured into a german pilsner . a - dark brown , no head . s - alcohol , fruit , caramel malt , hops t - caramel malt , fruit , hops . it seemed pretty highly hopped for an english barleywine . m - a little on the undercarbonated side , just the way that i like my barleywines . d - this beer is way too easy drinking considering its high abv

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.90 0.80	12 oz . bottle poured into das festhaus pint a : slightly cloudy , golden in color with an underlying orange-ish hue . large frothy head that quickly dissipates into an abyss of nothingness . no real lacing to mention . the beer kept bubbling tiny bubbles up from the bottom the entire time i drank it . s : very mild citrus , not much else detected . unimpressive smell . t : much better than expected . very complexyet not too strong . citrus , spice , wheat ? there 's a lot going on here . this is the most complex beer style i think i have ever tried . m : clean and crisp , not much of an aftertaste . thin to medium body with a significant amount of carbonation . d : a very refreshing late spring to summer brew , but a little expensive for heavy comsumption . i really like this beer due to its complexity and flavor . i will seek it out in the future , just not by the case , though . i do n't make that kind of scratch !

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	evenly hazy lightly greenish yellow appearance , medium head of bright white color . laces in dripping rings . aromatic , stuffy and yeasty with orange accents and light pineapple . mouthfeel is sub-medium , carbonation is fairly lively but more subdued than some . flavor is straightforward , senses of candied fruit , plenty of sugary sensations , chalky tones that range to chewing on a pencil , but mainly similar to many wits . finishes relatively clean with a lemon candy aftertaste . seems about typical for style , a bit metallic in all over impression and not highly spiced , but pleasant enough .

0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80 1.00	grabbed this at half time . a : fairly clear golden color with a touch of yeast floating around . poured with a finger and a half of white head that disipated to a thin cover . excellent lacing . s : big yeast smell right up front . then the hops are right behind it . lots of citrus . little bit of lemon . the yeast and hops work really well together . excellent nose . t : wow . really nice beer . the hops are really up front . bitterness up front . then the yeast comes through . very nice balance . the dry hopping comes across nicely . m : very light and refreshing . prickly carbonation . d : very nice beer . this should be a year round beer for them . really excellent on the first truly warm day in upstate ny . for the price 8.99 i was satisfied . again it begs the question how do beers that come from belgium cost less ? still excellent beer all around .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	750ml bottle batch 313 a- i 've had this beer a few times before , do n't know why i 've never reviewed it . anyways , here it goes . poured into a snifter . pours a golden yellow color with an off-white head . s- the aroma is sour and fruity with some citrus and a touch of spices and hints of oak as well . t- the taste is very light and intricate with a very dry finish . almost a little champagne-like . the taste is light fruit and spices with some sourness and hints of oak . m- the mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation . d- like just about every beer they brew , this one puts an interesting twist on the style . not the best wit out there , but definitely something different that is worth trying .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	07/08/08- shared with ba member talisker . presentation- 750ml bottle . did not look for freshness info . poured into a duvel tulip . appearance- clouded white-yellow colored pour . clouded from yeast sediment as well . head forms to about a 1/2 inch and fades fairly quickly . light lace streaks and trails reamin . smell- such a powerful smell for such a light abv beer . remeniscent of fantome and saison dupont . it brings the funk . lots of barnyard nose with mild urine , lots of wet hay , some hops and lemon rind . taste- all the flavors that are in the nose , but not quite as strong . grainy hay-like flavor with a pleasant fresh hop taste . white pepper and lots of lemon peel make the major taste of the beer . mouthfeel- mid range carbonation , a light hoppy aftertatse with a drying mouthfeel . drinkability- very drinkable , quenching and drying beer . perfect for a hot outside day . great flavors and overall beer for a beer of such a low alcohol content .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60	was n't sure what to expect when i cracked this open , the bottle gives no real indications as to style , and traditional stone typography on the back is entertaining , but mostly just nonsense . poured a lighter yellow than i had expected with plenty of active carbonation and a fantastic dense white head that lasted forever and stuck to the side of the glass . nose was fruity with suggestions of grapes and citrus . taste hits the palate not unlike an ipa really , lots of piny hop flavors shine through with slight melon and citrus flavors which can easily be detected . this beer starts off well but for me the finish is a bit of a disaster , the alcohol really can be felt/tasted after the swallow in a bad way . i 'm not against alcohol flavors in me beer when executed well but for me this was just a little too much , at 7.8 percent this is a fairly strong beer but it comes off like something above 10 percent at least . as others have suggested , this is a really good start to a great beer , perhaps if aged the alcohol will mellow a but and it will show more malt character . i probably would't have this again .

0.60 0.20 0.50 0.20 0.20	poured into my founders snifter . light amber in color . white head that is about a half a fingers thickness . goes away quickly . leaves a light ring around the glass . the bubbles dance against the light . smell is of clove , cinnamon and pumpkin . but really it smells more like vomit . honestly it 's making my stomach turn . tastes like clove and shitty pumpkin pie . this is truly awful . it is fairly light in the mouth and easy to drink , but the taste is so damn terrible there is no point . my drain is going to enjoy the rest of this .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	i got a couple of these in recent trades/bifs ... i think these came from nathan15 and cresent ... thanks again ! been itching to try one of these , it 's saturday night . time for a night cap . bottled oct 16 , 2006 . pours a bright and hazy orange color with a nice white head . aromas are awesome . i can smell this for a couple of feet away . stewed fruits , raisins , wet and hot cereal grains , and a bit of booze . taste is kind of hot up front , but not overpowering . you are just quickly reminded this is n't a session beer , this is a sipper ! flavors are of boozy fruits , not really sweet though , crisp , dry , and with a biting alcohol and a bitter hoppy finish . mouthfeel is nice . a bit harsh and hot , but it has a nice thick warming quality . drinkability is good . but whoa ... this is a big and beasty ! ! ! this one could easily sit for a while . maybe i 'll visit the other bottle next year sometime .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90	a - pours a nice dark brown with a decent two finger creamy tan head . s - not bad , vinous with a touch of vinegar . some fruitiness there as well . t - fruit vinegar and a touch of funk there . quite sweet and a little bit of hop bitterness present . really much more sweet and fruity than expected . i also sense a little bit of vanilla but not much . m - medium to thin body and average carbonation make this a refreshing brew with a great mouthfeel . d - refreshing , tasty and a something to it . this is a good brew which i am happy to drink a few of .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	on sale at local liquour store ... appearance-beautiful sunny yellow . head is white with a 2 finger head that slowly dissipates . some blotchy lacing remains . smell-some citrus and floral notes . pretty bland and not really what i was expecting . taste-was assuming for this beer to follow the smell but wow , this beer is great . the big suprise is just juicy pineapples and peach . i also get some banana and clove . hops do n't really come out on the bitter end but the fruit and floral flavors really come out . mouthfeel-refreshing and drinkable . very smooth and on the lighter side , but packs some flavor . carbonation is on the lower side for a pale ale overall-good beer , really drinkable , very flavorful . you can drink the bomber and not be hammered or even buzzed . highly reccomended .

0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured from a 10.14 oz . bottle into a pint glass at low altitude . a : pours a very light crystal clear yellow like any other adjunct , with a pithy white head that fades to nothing and leaves no lacing at all . s : a faint smell of malt without much of anything else . not a strong smell by any means . t : better on this front . malt and other grain notes up front followed by the slightest hint of hops . although the flavor is n't very strong , it 's quite well balanced and clean ; it does n't taste watered down and finishes with a nice bitterness . m : imagine a slightly less carbonated version of club soda . d : for what it 's worth , i think this is quite a nice representation of the style . that said , i 'm not sure the difference in quality between this one and cheaper adjuncts makes up for the price premium .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.90	got this bottle as a mystery ipa from davidsk in a trade . a - nice orange hazy with a good amount of head . lots of yeast sediment . s- a little citrus but mostly smelling lots of big hops ! t- excellent ! nice tingly feeling on the tongue . taste a little citrus with big piney hops . m - long after taste . carbonation leaves a nice light feeling on the tongue . d - very smooth highly drinkable . reviewed 5-25-10 1st review !

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.50	blackish/reddish with red edges with a off white head that stuck around for a few.mild lacing mild fruit ( sobi ) and malt smell slightly roasted taste.pac-man yeast is in there.sweet taste dominates.i personally cant taste the hops mild carbonation , nothing really harsh.not boozy at all very different for me to drink.but good , im glad i tried it.good solid brew but from rogue but not there best .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	big thanks to deepsouth for the jockster ! clear , amber orange pour with a foamer head of ivory . sticky laces too . very , very subtle aroma notes of pine and citrus . curious quaff of a malty , not hoppy , brew . this baby really needs an infusion of pine hops to make it a true ipa , for me . meets more of the amber ale style . no hint of alcohol , one could put down a sixer and not notice the 6.5 % - till you stand up . tasty brew , with no real faults except needing a hop kick .

0.60 1.00 0.70 0.80 0.80	it pours yellow orange with a quick to fizz away white head . looks a little cloudy . the high point is the smell : raspberries and citrus dominate with a muskiness beneath . the taste is very mild fruity emphasizes berries and ends with the warmth of the alcohol . the aftertaste is nearly absent , pretty smooth . mouthfeel is fair , seems a little flat as time passes on , but a drinkable brew nonetheless . i would reinvest my money for that smell . it could be a good summer evening drink .

0.40 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.40	appearance - clear typical pilz color . watered down apple juice . lots of initial carbonation almost 2 fingers but evaporates in about 2 min . fiz did n't last that long either . was gone after half the beer was consumed . smell - no noticeable yeast aroma . initial smell is of rust and corn oil . lingering smell of febreeze and or butane . these mask a light hop smell . taste - initial taste is very dull . flat not that malty , not that hoppy . there is a weak balance between that and the after-taste of nutra-sweet and pond water . mouthfeel - very low viscocity . not that thick a feel . only a mild tingle of carbonation drinkability - low . if consumed cold from a chilled glass on a hot day with lots of salty food it might serve ok .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.60	i was glad to find this limited release otter , for some of the limited are harder to find for me . the beer pours a clear pils-like gold that slightly up on carbonination though a fair amount of lace was born of the one inch white head . the aroma , oh the aroma of clean fresh blueberries was awesome ! ! the taste was abit sweet-tart like with a raspberry tartness to the mouthfeel . overall the body was abit weak or watery . this makes for a fair hot summer day beer . also makes a good beer with a fruit pie . : a cooking note , it makes a great smelling pancake addition to your mix . a down-right handy summer brew to have around .

0.60 0.30 0.70 0.40 0.40	bottle reads : a mystical blend of four aphrodisiacs combined with the powers of our magical totem pole make this a uniquely stmulatin brew . okay so 500ml of mystical aphrodisiac into my wine glass . this beer has a strange vibe to it . a- little head , only a thick ring and a patch in the center . peculiar amber with a very subtle pink hue . with the bubbles rising reminds me a bit of a pink champagne . completely clear with no lacing . s- pee-yuuu was my first thought . smells like grappa with a chocolaty background . t- hard to say . it tastes good and bad at the same time . really tastes like light strawberry juice . ends with a barleywine-esque bitterness . m- very thin , medium carbonation , very dry . d- refreshing and drinks okay but i 'd be pissed if this is all i 'd have to drink for the night . a whole pint would be too much . i got used to it after a few sips and downed it but this is not what i 'm looking for when i want a beer . a tough-guy cooler .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.40	half growler from new beer . poured into a squared off pint glass . filtered copper body , gooey inch of off-white froth . smell is a mute ipa . a squirt of tangerine & peach at the end . very ho-hum . taste again , is a very paltry pale . very little malt , faded earthy hops , with more flavor & bitterness coming from the rindy , soured fruit itself . a weak , almost stale base beer . lemongrass , peaches , half-ripe apricots ( skins , pits & all ) , the fruit is what 's interesting here . bittersweet , it saves this `` beer '' from being absolute junk . the noticeable alcohol does n't seem to mingle with the rest of the beer . a little feel of graininess on the finish keeps gives the actual base beer at least one positive aspect . feel is average to strong in carbonation , with a good froth always getting on your lips . it feels a little stiffer on tap , but do n't ask me to put down $ 6 for another glass . beer is very light-bodied for 7 % . the base beer needs some real work . : |

0.60 0.60 0.30 0.20 0.30	not a very worthwhile experience . poured flat and tasted blandish . thin feel and a real lack of substance or flavour . i 've had a few other trafalgar beers which were pretty decent , so i was surprised . i noticed another comment on the flatness , so i suppose some of the bottles could have not been properly sealed .

0.50 0.70 0.50 0.50 0.40	this beer poured with nearly zero head . and yeast clumps were rampant despite leaving a bit in the bottom of the bottle . there is a nice spicy aroma from this beer , but perhaps subdued due to know head with popping bubbles adding to the pungency . first taste seems to be a bit on the watery side , but does lend a slight spicy/yeast balance ... but unfortunately it 's seems off in the distance . again the watery taste also reflects in the mouthfeel and it just seems too light for a dubbel which is the top of the styles i like . due to the lackluster experience , the drinkability suffers as well .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50	on-tap somewhere in fashion island at newport beach . first tango with deschutes . served in a pint glass on november 4th , 2011 . a - deep golden/amber coloring with a light cream-colored head . fluffy , though average , lacing and retention . s - eh , a bit muted . light citrus notes and pine . t - better but not by much . initial hop bite shifts into grapefruit tartness . middle notes include slight malt presence and fruit sweetness . bitter finish with ( oddly ) some alcohol warming in the back of the throat . m - medium body , not too smooth , quite carbonated , almost excessively so . d - finding more eloquent descriptions for a relatively bland pale ale is pretty difficult . a disappointment . oh well .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.50	341ml bottle poured into a 16oz pokal . a - pours with a thick mocha head , about a finger-and-a-half . the actual color is near pitch-black , with just the slightest touch of red when held up to the light . as the head begins to recede it 's already leaving lacing down the glass . s - roasted malt and skunky-ness ( ? .. ) are immediately apparent . meh . t - the actual taste of the beer says a whole lot more than the aroma . really heavy on the roasted malt upfront . molasses , burnt coffee and a touch of sourness . m - fairly heavy body with medium carbonation . works well with the style . d - i 'm not a huge fan of stouts , and this one is n't really an exception . less-than-enjoyable flavor really does it in . though i have to admit , it looks pretty good .

0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.90	a : pretty thick and black as night . quarter inch head , nice and tan . thick bubbles ... good retention . heavy lacing on this guy . s : i 'm not getting a whole heck of a lot of coffee . a touch of espresso is on the nose , but i 'm also getting cocoa and a touch of nutty malt ... almost like a walnut . smells a touch hot . wish there was a bit more coffee smell here considering they say they use the finest beans in san diego ... would have liked to have gotten a better scent of them ... hope it is in the taste instead . to be honest , not getting much smell at all . thought i was maybe a bit stuffed up but even the wife said she did n't get a lot on a whiff . t : yeah , wow ... there is the coffee . dominates the palette . espresso beans/coffee beans way up front ... touches of cocoa arise . none of the nut malt is in this any more . i 'm getting all big bold taste of san diego 's finest and i 'm lovin it . it has a touch of heat to it , a nice warmth that is a good touch ... but for the most part this hides the alcohol with the bitterness of the coffee and the sweet of the cocoa m : big , bold , thick and chewy . nice and silky smooth . perfect level of carb to help bring this out on the palette . o : very solid stout . i wish the nose was a bit stronger , but man does it hit you with the taste . coffee is bold and in your face . the coffee is a touch out of balance because of the sheer volume , but that is the point and i respect it and approve . smooth and a sipper for sure . and after the bottle is gone ... yeah , it is 12 % , maybe 13 % .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.70 0.30	what a treat , 2008 bottle acquired via trade with jchow79 , many thanks for this unique find ! my bottle does n't look like what is pictured above , but i still believe this is the appropriate review for this beer . a : completely dark , poured like syrup , with virtually no head on the pour despite a vigorous splash for the last 3rd of a glass . a 2008 bottle might be a little low on carbonation ... . s : wow . huge smell of chocolate syrup and rich , sweet bourbon . i 've never smelled this particular combination in a beer before ... i 'm officially *intrigued* . t : another `` wow '' . huge flavors of sweet sweet chocolate ... the high alcohol content ( 13 % ) gives this guy a *spice* that gives it similarities to a good , rich brandy . toffee like flavors and a hint of caramel on the finish . this guy is sweet , then roasty , then warm and syrupy as the taste moves through with each swallow . m : despite the age , i think the spice and alcohol still gives this beer a light tingle in the mouth . the finish is syrupy and thick . d : i think drinkability is the most subjective of the 5 categories ... for me , i always judge `` drinkability '' by how easily the bottle goes down , and if i 'd like to have another one of the exact same thing right after it , the next day , ect . that 's where this guy really struggles for me . it had an amazing nose , and it just explodes with rich , sweet , and spicy flavors in your mouth . and for that it merited big scores for smell , taste , and mouthfeel . the first 3-4 ounces were awesome . but over time , as i worked through the glass , this just became a chore for me to finish . it 's got a big sweet/spicy flavor ... just so much so that it 's not terribly drinkable . i really enjoyed trying it , but i would not want to have a 2nd one back-to-back or even another one later this week .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.70	poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a belled beer glass . rather a non-traditional label with pretty green hops and green fingerprints , and a little blurb about the beer and brewery . robotic looking additional label says it was brewed in apr '03 ( maybe '08 ) and is best enjoyed by apr '010 . the beer is a robust golden orange with a tan head which is fluffy but leaves no lacing . very strong smells of pineapple and pirate beers waft away from the glass . there is caramel , yeast and citrus along with the sea , like the belgian pirate-themed beers i have tried . the taste is tangy , malty , sweet and bitter but without a heap of hoppy bite . i kinda dig the malty sweet balance and friendly lack of strong aftertaste . the tang is abundant and enjoyable . i like the moderate carbonation in spite of my noted penchant for lots of bubbles . the body is full and silky with a tinge of dryness . i could drink this in excess but it is not a gulper by any means . the 6.5 % abv is not obvious but it has a fruitiness that begs more to be enjoyed than imbibed . i like it and hope to find more beer from this norwegian brewery . cold weather seems to encourage the brewing gene ... slainte .

0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70 0.80	unlike many beer drinkers , this sort of thing does n't really bring back memories of my underage days . ( i have cheap , nasty wine coolers for that ) this is my first ever malt liquor . wheee pours a clear straw with a not-bad head . got a whiff of ... beer really . was expecting worse . definitely a sweetish , chemically smell , but not overwhelming.is that some hops ? could be ... hiding behind the solvent . tastes ... kinda apple-juicy , again with a boozy undertone . i admit i was expecting some nasty , drainpourish swill , but this is n't really any worse than your average macro . might be a bit better in fact . does n't feel overly sweet or bitter , and the carbonation is strong , but not painful . it 's a bit astringent , and i guess a touch on the dry side . alright , this is n't exactly the height of craft brewing , but ya know , i kinda like it . it 's smooth , refreshing , and actually does n't taste bad at all . unlike a lot of macros , it avoids the bitter-with-no-flavour problem by not being bitter ... so i guess you can say it 's balanced . it 's a bit boozy , which i attribute to high alcohol to taste ratio , but for what it is , it 's not bad . i look forward to sampling other malt liquors ... but i wish they came in smaller sizes .

0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60 0.60	a- copper , not at all translucent , head immediately disappears s- fruity at first , all spice , cinnamon , hibiscus , smells a little like apple cider with other fruit notes t- lemon , citrus , alcohol taste in the mid-palate , nothing too crazy here , a little tart , not too spicy or bitter m- very carbonated , very refreshing , kind of boring

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.90 0.80	bottled on date 07/13/11 stamped on neck . 12oz poured into a duvel tulip . appearance - slightly hazy light amber body . big white head with low stick and retention . smell - musky corn . like an american adjunct lager . no other discernible smells . pretty boring and bland . taste - strong alcohol in the body , with a surprisingly smooth finish . mouthfeel . lots of flavor . dark over ripe fruit . corn . mouthfeel - harsh astringency in the body , but finishes clean and smooth . overall drinkability - depends what you 're in the mood . this beer has a big kick in the middle , so if that 's what you 're looking for .

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90	a - this beer had a golden hue with decent lacing . nothing special s - huge ginger spice with a large backup of malt . hint of almond and lemon t - huge sweetness that dies off gradually . sweetest beer i can remember . spicy and compliments the smell . m - thin and smooth , carbonation does not come in to play which may be from the age . mouth dries out at the end . d - this beer is very drinkable . alcohol is very moderate . final thoughts : this beer leaves you wanting more . with the dry ending you ca n't help but take another sip . i like it .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.50	just was n't what i was hoping for . i expected it to be a bit hoppier or something but it just was n't my favorite brew . kind of disappointing to me . i knew it was gon na be belgian and thats fine but it just seemed weak to me . not sure why but i was n't able to come up with anything epic about it .

0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.80	presentation : 22 oz . bomber - love their designs . appearance - poured thick slightly yellowish head with big , squirmy bubbles . dissipates to thin film after a few minutes . deep red , slightly brownish translucent hue . really nice color . smell - decent malty pale ale aroma . very much like an average pale ale actually . mouthfeel - light/medium bodied beer . perhaps a little oily after awhile ( possibly because of the pepper ) but nothing offensive . taste - good carbonation up front , slight chipotle spiciness already . good hoppy/chili spice up front . balanced moderate malty sweetness and slight aromatic , but hardly bitter hopiness at the back of the mouth . then the chipotle really takes over leaving a decently hot/spicy taste all over the mouth and lips . a little bit of the sweetness lingers as well , feeling a bit odd with the chipotle . hint of bitterness also lingers at the back of the mouth . interesting combination . suprisingly well balanced chipolte hotness with an otherwise average ale taste . definitely drinkable , but do n't expect a refreshing cold one or anything .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.40	12 oz . bottle poured into a pilsner glass . what freshness date ? the pour is almost golden with two fingers ' white head . the head is gone quickly , and there is very little lacing . there is little smell , but what i can catch is sweet with a tiny bit of spice . something in there reminds me of budweiser . the sweetness continues into the taste , but the spice goes by the wayside in favour of some grassiness . some metallic flavour is present as well . there is very little bitterness , and as the name states , the finish is dry ( not so sure about the super part ) . mouthfeel is light and watery . carbonation is high ( which fits with the style ) . drinkability suffers because of the lingering metallic taste . i am glad that i have only the one bottle . this beer is a prime example of higher cost not always giving better product . i bought this thinking it would have more to offer than other japanese beers i 've had . i definitely will not be trying this again .

0.60 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.60	a treat from the good folk at oregon trail . she 's a touch cloudy and appears an amber color , not really `` brown '' i 'd say , nonetheless , brilliant on the carbonation side . the smell is intoxicating , a hint of bourbon , vanilla , oak , floral hops , a bit of a burn , no malt . the olfactories belie the beer within , however . bourbon tingles the tongue first , then vanishing . its absconding reveals a plain , perhaps infected beer . there is a tartness here not altogether unpleasant , but a bit out of the ordinary . what would more time have done ? the hops finish it off with a quick burst of flowers and citrus and leave the mouth a bit dry . a bit disappointing , especially after the bourbon porter and the aroma of this one . my thoughts on the origin of this beer ( just a guess , perhaps i am mistaken ) is that this is some pale or ipa that did n't turn out just great ( a little infected , perhaps ) and a barrel previously used for the porter was reused for this purpose . this would explain the light color ( from what i recall , quite a shade lighter than their usual brown ) and the funkiness that dwells within . regardless , these are good people , making good beers , their bourbon barrel porter an especial example . i wish to try it now , i remember it being my favorite beer from my last rodeo through the nw quadrant of oregon .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a sam adams perfect pint glass . beer pours a coppery amber with a faint head that quickly recedes and leaves a generous amount of lacing . in my opinion , racer 5 is one of the best smelling beers on the market . one whiff revels a cascade of piney and citrus hops aroma . it 's the quintessential west coast ipa aroma . taste is highlighted by an aggressive hops bitterness but is balanced out my the malt . medium bodied mouthfeel . for a beer topping out at 7.0 % , racer 5 is ridiculously drinkable . in my opinion , this one of the best ipas available at the moment . it never fails to deliver .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	12oz brown bottle with a cryptic `` 6236 '' on the back , along with a statement that this brew is a blend of 10 different malts . sweet . pitch black opaque beer with a finger thick , creamy coffee colored , tight bubbled lace . sticky lace . nice retention . roasted aroma of chocolate , sweet coffee and a slight cinnamon bun finish . oxidation . whoa ! this brew has got one hella-creamy mouthfeel . it 's very smooth with a fluffy thickness on the palate . malts are very complex with a roasted / molasses twang , oxidized / sherry , wood , chocolate brownies , burnt edges , baked raisins , hints of prune , coffee syrup , suggestions of toffee and a dry-ish chocolate grain finish . notes of a mixed-bag of baking spices . alcohol becomes more noticeable ( warming ) as the beer warms , gets a bit prickly , which also pulls out more of the oxidized / sherry characters . hop bites through , along side the roasty twang , with a light citric character . lingers dry with notes of wet cardboard . a wicked tasty brew , but like most bell 's beers that i 've tried it 's far too oxidized and kills what would otherwise be an devastatingly delicious twist on the style .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	a - pale orange body with a srong carbonation element . the head is minimal and white . s - sweet citrus hops aroma . there are also hints of banana and apricot . t - the hops are tose consisting of bitter citrus and subtle black licorice . m - the feel is a bit on the coarse side and can be felt mainly on the top middle and outside back of my tongue . ~ this is not a bad brew by any means . i like the flavor and am very impressed by the aroma it offers . as for a sessionable ipa i think this may be one . give it a try .

0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.50	aroma : mild malt and trace of apple ? there is an appealing scent that is just too subtle for me to name in there as well . hints of spice as well . the closest i could come was powdered sugar , but that just doesn & # 8217 ; t make any sense . appearance : painfully clear , so pale that i & # 8217 ; m afraid it won & # 8217 ; t have any backbone . formed a respectable head of tiny white bubbles that quickly faded into a weak ring but carbonation lasted well into the beer . flavor : the balance is on the malt , which is technically out of style for a pilsner . there is only the smallest hint of hops deep in the aftertaste , but there is enough to keep the malt from being unpleasantly syrupy . mouthfeel : for the light taste , a hefty mouthfeel , which , again , is out of style here . no hop pucker at all . overall impression : this beer tastes great ! my only beef is that it just doesn & # 8217 ; t say & # 8220 ; pilsner & # 8221 ; to me . maybe closer to a dortmunder export in style ? if you are in the & # 8220 ; style smyle & # 8221 ; camp , i can only say this beer is good , but fairly bland . i also found it fairly filling , which counts against drinkability . i love north coast beers , but this one just didn & # 8217 ; t float my boat .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	on tap @ 21st ammendment/san francisco ca ( from notes ) pilsner glass w/watermelon wedge . not too cloudy amber color . slightly bitter . really standard american wheat profile , if subpar . the watermelon wedge rescues this significantly although maybe they had to tone down the wheat to balance with the fruit ? i dont know ... fun to drink though , very light , summer-y .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.70	on cask at cittie of yorke in london . from notes . a - poured a slightly hazy dark gold colour with a creamy one finger eggshell head . soapy bubbles on the sides of the glass . nice rings of creamy lacing and a half finger of retention . s - bready with some butter . apple comes out . earthy and some high school locker sort of aroma . t - nice gentle malt and hop balance . bready with some buttery/butterscotch notes with a little crisp hop note . crackers might be in there too . m - nice touch of carbonation . slightly sweet finish with a light and creamy body . o/d - high dinkability as this is tasty and low abv . a good beer with depth and interesting parts coming together as you go . a good one but nothing crazy .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.80	11.2 oz bottle ahh my first ara since having it on draught at de dolle ! out of the bottle it pours a slightly hazy brown/orange color with lots of rising carbonation and a monster of a white head . the nose is incredible as it is with many of de dolle beers . big floral esters , mint , lemon , sweet malts and subtle but detectable hops . its hard to define the taste of ara , so crisp and refreshing , yeast and malt invade first , nothing overwhelming just a nice flow of light flavor , it falls off midway leaving the bright fruitiness and moderate hop bite . it sports a medium body with lots and lots and lots of tiny carbonation bubbles . amazing brew , perfect for summertime , actually this is drinkable anytime ... beware of the burps !

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.50	thanks to masterski for providing this at our esb ( fail ! ) showdown . a - pours an odd looking orangish/reddish/brown . just seems like an artificial color for some reason . little bit of yellow on the edges . no stick or ring at all on my pour , although masterski showed a fine ring on his . s - something of a fail here on the smell . a strange sulphur-like smell hit me at first , actually thought i was smelling something else . caramel malts are primarily in the light smelling profile . t - this is really boring and average . caramel malts , some sort of lighter , sweet fruit taste . a bit of honey , tastes kind of like honey water , just nothing going on here . m - english style carbonation ( soft ) and lighter bodied . appropriate for the style . d - this is just a boring beer that is easy enough to get down , but not particularly good . do n't want this again .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	thanks to imperialhopper83 for sending this along in a trade , an amazing beer and i 'm really digging the couple of offerings i 've had from terrapin at this point . pour is from the bottle to a snifter . appearance : pour is darkest brown/near black ; starts with a 1/4 finger dark tan head that fades immediately to nothing but a faint whisp in the center and a thin ring around the surface ; body is opaque and there is spotty and loose lacing left on the sides of the glass . smell : oh my ! amazingly strong - smells of syrupy semi-sweet chocolate and very deep roasty and toasty malts ; smells like very fresh brewed espresso ... actually , the `` freshness '' of the smell is really quite intense . taste : very burnt and roasty malt characteristics that are reminiscent of fresh brewed espresso and grounds ; faint flavors of semi-sweet baking chocolate ; i have to admit , this would be an amazing morning drink . mouthfeel : body is moderately thick , but not quite as thick as other imperials like old rasputin ; carbonation is farly strong for an imperial , but it 's quite smooth and creamy ; fair stick is left on the roof of the mouth , gums are left tingly and the belly is left pretty warm from the 8.1 % abv . drinkability : i could smell this beer all day , and the flavors are quite solid and fresh ; abv is a bit high and it does sit a tad heavy , but i could easily get through a couple of these in a sitting .

0.40 0.80 0.60 0.70 0.60	a : pours a slightly murky pale straw body with almost no head . s : sweet malts , corn , and honey . t : the honey comes through pretty strong , with a sweet corn flavor following . finishes with a scotch-like bitterness . m : pretty standard ; good level of carbonation , good cold . d : again , pretty average . so far probably one of my favorite lagers to have with indian food .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90 1.00	a rocky light tan head sits full and fluffy leaving some lace as it slowly fades . body is a pure amber sap in color . nose has some citrus rind , soapy alchol and prickley pine but all relatively soft . a nice mix of crisp approachable hops and fruity citrus based sweet sour feel enter the mouth on first sip . hops turn creamy on the back of the tongue as you continue to drink . malt balance is really there also . bitter does develop on the mouthfeel but it is pleasant . super easy to drink , very well made ipa . would have been close to a 4.5 if the nose was a little more developed .

0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70 0.60	ok had heard good things about this stuff though had been frightened to try malt liquor again after many bad bad hangovers when i first came to usa with the `` 800 '' bought in the 24 0z steel colored can . says `` extra malted barley and select hops for extra gravity '' ah well the appearance of this malt liquor when poured into a glass ( i know its heresy malt liquor is best straight outta da bottle covered in a brown bag ) , is pretty good..nice golden colour there was a massive foamy head for a second or two , but it did leave a ring . afraid the smell is horrid..brings back the old english hangovers yuk . taste however is way better than oe800 i actually tasted some descent malt in here , better than many beers that would pretend to look down on this..like other reviewers the taste actually gets a little better when it warms a tad..not like the usual malt liquor.actually its a pretty good taste ... i 'm warming to this beer..also the alcohol warmth actually feels good.. mouthfeel is average lager beer though above average malt liquor . for something so strong and a malt liquor this is very drinkable .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	750ml poured into a chalice appearance : beer pours a magnificent caramel colour with white head smell - i 'm not picking up too much here except for a bready aroma taste - faint citrus flavor to go along with an aftertaste of the aroma which is reminiscent of baked bread mouthfeel - approppriate carbonation makes this a pretty smooth drinking beer , slight sweetness on the finish , no detection of the alcohol whatsoever , which may be a good or a bad thing depending upon your perspective my first sample of this dutch company 's offerings and i have to say that this was a good brew that i 'd be willing to revisit .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.80	i changed the oil in my car this past weekend , and the oil coming out of the crankcase was no less black or viscous than this beer . this is about as black as beer gets . no light makes its way through the glass , not even the edges . the head is frothy and dark tan . sticks to the sides , but settles down into a thin skim in only a few minutes . the smell is huge . there 's a lot of beer in this beer . roasted barley , dry cocoa , a bit of sourness which i thought was strange . the taste and mouthfeel are where this beer shines . the taste is n't as kick-you-in-the-teeth , scratch your tastebuds dry and roasty as i expected . it 's smooth , and a bit sweet . coffee beans are quite pronounced in the taste , as is some bakers ' chocolate . the mouthfeel is the creamiest thing i 've ever tasted . it 's velvety smooth . drinkability is quite good considering the density of flavors and the high abv . there 's just something a bit funky about the smell .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.30 0.30	spied this at the store i searched out to get the double bastard and being a fan of other lambics , i had to try it . a : pours about the brightest red i 've ever seen . not much head , but that could be due to the size of the sample ( 1 pint , 9 oz . bottle split four ways ) . s : smells like a typical lambic , but not a very strong cherry scent as i was expecting . t : ooh ! really , really , really sour . too sour for my liking . m : light body . do n't want to keep it in my mouth too long , though , because it 's so sour . d : nope . i just ca n't get past the sourness . if sourness is what you like in a lambic , then this is certainly the beer for you . personally , though , i 'll take a lindemann 's any day of the week .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	man , this is a big looking beer . pours a very cloudy and dark brown . large head with an almost yellow tone to it . aroma is overwhelming like a dipa . raisins are the first to be noticed , followed by strong vanilla and rum , some chocolate and caramel ; very sweet and a lot of alcohol in the smell , making this an imposing brew . taste is surprisingly restrained , no cloying aspect or diesel-fuel like taste that makes you think this is some glorified paint thinner . it really is an amped up version of the raison d'etre . a soft rum flavor is the most dominant for me , lingering sweetness some vanilla and light chocolate . big alcohol warming eventually hits , but its very nice and not jarringly acerbic . a damn fine brew . easily the most drinkable over 15 percenter i have ever had , though that is small company . a definite sipper for the home , but well worth the effort .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.60	pours a copper-gold , well carbonated with a three finger rocky and creamy tan head , left webs of lacing . but it went downhill from there , the weakest of the wachusett offerings that i have had . citrus and earthy hop in the aroma . roasted malt , butter , butterscotch , caramel , a bit of red apple in the sweet taste . but it did n't come together . medium bodied , a bit oily .

1.00 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.70	still trying to get my cheaks to stop puckering after this one . the flavor was like sour grapes with vinegar notes . the aroma was sour and vinegary with a slightly sweet fruity background . the burgundy body is topped by a medium thick off-white head with a good amount of lace . full bodied , dry and slightly warming .

0.90 0.70 0.80 1.00 0.90	black and inky . thick mocha head with great looking thick lace . looks delicious . hard to pull much out of the nose . served in an imperial pint glass which is the wrong choice of glassware as i see it , hindering the smell ? there is however some dark chocolate aromas , anise , some hop , and roasted malts . well i 'm not sure if they got a mislabled keg on this one but if this is n't barrel age i 'm fooled , or maybe intoxicated ? it has all the characteristics of a barrel aged beer . thick sweet coconut flavors , with a toasty oak background . very well integrated . finish is mediocre but leaves you wanting your next sip . too be honest i was n't crazy about this beer from bottle but on draught it 's a whole different ball game . overly desirable brew . will be here for the next week till it 's gone . mouth is round and somewhat bitter . a very dry finish . i could drink this till i pass out .

0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.80	i like this beer . i tend to like ipas a lot , as they are bitter , hoppy and refreshing . this is one of the better ones out there that pretty much anyone can find down at the local grocery . it smells a bit skunky right off , but if you let it breath for a moment or two after you open the bottle , the smell goes away . i did n't pour it into a glass , though , so i can not comment upon the head or lacing . the taste is pure ipa goodness , bitter , hoppy , no alcohol flavour or aftertaste . a really easy-to-drink kind of beer .

0.50 0.40 0.70 0.70 0.70	poured into tulip glass..dark yellow with quickly dissappeared head ... looks like apple juice . smells of citrus..and formaldahyde . tastes of sour patch kids with a dose of laffy taffy . definately an acquired taste that i 'm not sure i have acquired but is good for style . definately a slow sipping beer.. not for sessioning . since my beer no head with minimal lacing , i will try another once i have the chance ... but taste wise , my beer tasted fresh .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.40	poured from bottle into pint glass a - clear light yellow with 2 fingers of foam that are sticky s - kind of a grassy smell reminds me of budweiser t - not a lot of flavor but crisp and clean again reminds me of budweiser . m - smooth and light body with little carbonation d - better then bud or miller but not that impressed .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	a - black as night and no light passes through ! not a lot of head but what forms stays around . s - awesome on my nose well hopped . one of the best . t - catching some bitterness from the heavy hops which were present in the aroma . the alcohol is present for me . m - soft to the mouth . d - the offering is a good black ipa however i 'd preer a bit more balance on the hops to malt .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	received as an extra in a trade . thanks chris ! pours a hazy light amber with a fluffy , two-finger tall off-white head . a lot of oily lacing are left on the sides of the glass as the head subsides . the nose on this one is very strong . some pineapple , orange zest , and grapefruit along with some floral and piney notes . if this tastes as good as it smells , i 'm in for a sweet , citrusy treat . the taste is , unfortunately , not as juicy as the nose might suggest . i was expecting a citrus hop bomb , but got a much more balanced beer . the citrus notes are there , but not in dominating form that the nose implied . the first thing i noticed was the malt backbone before the hops took over . mouth feel is smooth and slightly oily . light carbonation . drinkability is high since this is n't excessively bitter or overly sweet . a solid ipa .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80	the apricot flavor is a little too strong for me . but it is refreshing

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80 0.80	pours a two-finger white head that goes slowly leaving a good lace . clear golden color . good carbonation and medium bodied . slight malty nose . starts mellow with some sweetness , finish is more malt than hop with no aftertaste . keeps well , bought 8/2004 . expensive - $ 7.99 for a 16oz flip-top bottle from hoosick street discount bev . troy , ny .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	the 330 ml stubby brown bottle was opened and after pouring , the beer looked clearer than typical foe the style . the body was reddish brown in color , and the head that sat atop was steady at a thickness of two fingers , thanks to the duvel tulip i had selected for the occasion . the aroma was simply fantastic . sweet candy sugar , cherries , white pepper , and leather were present in the smell is quite abundant quantities . the taste couldnt quite deliver the complexity that the nose promised . the yeast had pretty much consumed all simple sugars , leaving this beer rather dry and peppery . the body was also a little thin , and couldnt quite keep up with the alcohol . citric sourness tang remained however , making it hard to really dislike . i suppose one could consider this a pale ale in a dark disguise . spices were quite up front , but did not overwhelm . this was well made , but fell short of the lofty heights reached by its other compatriots .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.60	finally tried this . i have come to like sam 's boston lager and am a huge fan of their ales . 12 oz bottle , poured ok , half the head i usually get from bl . very nice looking , darker than i expected . laced well . smell ? maybe i have a sinus infection or something ( or had the beer too cold ) but i could hardly smell anything . the faint aromas i got were plesant , but i did n't really smell much . again ... what taste ? i guess i will have to try some macro swill again so that i realize that not all beer has flavor . i may have to try this again some time in the summer and re-review . mouthfeel was really good for a light beer . liked the carbonation , and felt richer than it tasted . drinkability ... definitely not a drain pour , but i 'd rather have something with more flavor . choice between this and `` lite '' or bud light , this wins , but i prolly wont buy it again unless i really do have no smell due to sinus .

0.70 0.20 0.70 0.20 0.20	bottled : 2/3/11 a : pours a dark brown ale , little to no head formation . able to agitate a decent quilt of latte head . this dissipates quickly . spotty lacing . s : phenols , banana ester . not sure why they released this beer . it 's a mess . comes out way too hot . hints of anise . t : astringent , alcoholic . wow , on first taste , i 'm considering pouring this one . bitter , sharp , chemical . not good at all . m : thin for the style with medium carbonation . slicks palate with thick coat . not a bad feel , but out of place nonetheless . d : very , very poor . i just poured this out . horrible example . the brewer 's should have their wages cut for this one . embarrassing for widmer .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	*poured from a 12 oz bottle into a sam adams pint glass* this pale ale poured a bright amber/orange color with just a few little specks whirling around . there was a beautiful , fluffy , cream colored , two finger head that lingered for around 2-3 minutes . there was some light lacing left on the glass . the aroma was of mostly citrus hops . orange , lemon , and grapefruit were the frontrunners with hints of pineapple and maybe a touch of pine bringing up the rear . this beer smells really , really good . i 've had ipa 's that did n't have this much hop aroma going on . ( i 've been looking forward to this part ) taste ? well , its not quite what i expected . i mean , its good . very good , in fact . but it almost feels like the aroma wrote a check the flavor ca n't cash . i 'm getting grassy green hops , some light citrus , and just enough balancing malts to , well , balance things out . this beer is crisp , clean , and refreshing . i just ca n't grade it higher than a 4 , though , because theres not quite enough of what i like in it . the mouthfeel of this beer was good . i would n't call it watery , but i would n't say its like maple syrup either . it finishes clean with just enough residual bitterness to remind you to take another drink . it has light to moderate carbonation and just enough sugar to make my lips just a tad sticky . drinkability ? omfg ... seriously ... keep 'em coming . if this was readily available in my area , it would be my `` go to '' beer . for the style , three floyds knocked this one out of the park .

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.90	the beer departs the 22 ounce bottle a beclouded yellowish orange with an exorbitant creamy white head that slowly fades away , the resultant lace a nice occluding sheet upon the glass . nose has a big citrusy , grassy , flowery aroma , the malt sweet , crisp and clean . start is sweet at the front , with the malt pronounced and the hops spicy , top is medium in feel . finish has an invigorating hop spiciness , the acidity agreeable , with the hop spicy aftertaste permanently bolted to the palate .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.40	burgundy colored beer with a super thick , densely creamy head that lasts really well . some nice elements in the nose ( a touch of smoke , apple , grapefruit , ) but it 's mostly very unpleasant , shows a lot of oxidation , dullness and even a light manure note . flavor is very dull and oxidized , with cardboard notes and a light note of manure . has a pleasant caramel-like sweetness with some fruit notes . not crazy about aged american barley wines as i think they tend to oxidize too quickly and this is another example that validates my opinion . not enjoyable , basically a drainpour .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.70 0.20	appearance - almost no head on this one , very fine lacing left , basically black in appearance , smell - very clear smell of vanilla and caramel ( almost like a werthers original ) , even smelled like a glass of amaretto to an extent , taste - sweet ! , but it did remind me of a creme brulee , with the strong taste of a sweet caramel mixed with a heavy dose of vanilla , mouth feel - some thickness , could have been thicker , drinkability - way too sweet so it loses pts in for drinkability , between two people we could n't finish the glass due to the sweetness of this one .

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.90 0.80	this one is named in response to poe 's story , `` the hop frog '' . also , it seems different from the other ipas listed for bullfrog , so i feel justified in adding it as a new entry . it is cloudy yellow in color , which is not a great look for an ipa . however , as i lean in to take a whiff , it becomes almost painfully apparent that this is a for-sure ipa . some hairs burned up in my nostrils , but no worries , cauterization is good . yow ! the beer has a very creamy mouthfeel with a great tang on the tongue . the citrus/grapefruit flavor absolutely abounds - in the mouth , on the finish , in the aftertaste . wonderful .

0.50 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50	poured from a 330ml . bottle . appearance : pours & looks like a cola . 2-3 fingers worth of head that bubble and disappear . smell : strong molasses , sugar , caramel and nuts . taste : cola-ish a bit with molasses cookies and gingerbread . sweet . mouthfeel : not too much feel . watery and short lived . overall : nice smell , average taste but the rest is forgettable . better malt options .

0.90 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.90	beer poured into a guinness imperial pint glass . forms a nice pillowy 2 finger head . great lacing on the glass and a lovely burnt orange color . nose is a light blend of citrus , hops and a little malt . i believe it smells like a typical english pale but it 's not especially appetizing to me ; almost a bit metallic . taste is crisp with light malt on the forefront and light hops in the finish . very crisp and easy to drink but nothing complex or interesting . light bodied beer and could use some more carbonation . overally , this beer was inconsistent as it offered glimpses of brilliance , only to disappoint in other areas .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.80	this brew certainly has its time and place . as unremarkable as it is , pounding a few of these while eating a burger at your local bar is certainly an experience to savor . like most macros , its easy going down , and unappealing in scent or appearence . however , its taste is better than most beers in its class , and its affordability is always ( for me ) a factor .

0.90 0.60 0.80 1.00 1.00	poured from a 750 ml bottle into an imperial pint glass . a- brown and yellow cloud . poured with an inch or two of thick white head . s- very sour and thick . smells nothing like it tastes . t- sharp at the beginning , giving way to an incredibly smooth finish . the aftertaste is citrusy and wheaty , but finished almost like a hefeweizen with banana . m- a little thin , but in a good way . carbonated and light . d- incredible summer beer . perfect for an evening . this beer is the best witbier i have had . it 's much smoother than others i have tried , and i really like the hint of banana finish on the end . will definitely buy again .

0.90 0.90 0.90 0.60 0.70	2011 bottle . poured into my sierra nevada bulb glass . appearance : pours a pitch black with a one finger dark tan colored creamy looking head . smell : roastiness , hints of coffee , dark chocolate . taste : a little too bitter/hoppy off the bat for me . along with the hoppiness is a good dosage of booze . after the initial hop hit , there is the nice roasty flavors from the nose with a lingering aftertaste of coffee and dark chocolate . i feel like this has a lot of potential but it needs some age to calm down . tone down the booziness first and foremost , secondly those hops need to blend into the malt more . mouthfeel : nice and thick and creamy . a little bit more carbonation bite than i normally like . overall : i was hoping it would be better than it was , however i think this beer has some enormous aging potential . i was surprised at how boozy it was especilly with no real booze scents coming from the nose . i might pick up another bomber or two just to test the ageability in the coming years . $ 5.99 a bomber is the right price to experiment with .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.50	poured from an 750ml bottle into a cigar city snifter globe . appearance : pours a dark cola brown with a 1 finger bubbly dark tan head . nice head retention and lacing . smell : sweet roasted malt , vanilla and french oak . taste : very dark roasted malt and a touch of whiskey up front followed by very strong woody notes and the flavor of what i would imagine black tar would taste like in the middle before ending with espresso and bitterness at the finish . aftertaste is very woody and bitter . not really enjoyable for me . mouthfeel : medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation . the tannins really dry out the mouth . drinkability : low drinkability . i would n't want another glass . overall : below average beer overall . i definitely prefer the original jose marti . it 's the least drinkable ccb beer i 've tried . i ca n't recommend this one especially since it was $ 20 for the bottle at ccb this weekend . i feel a little shortchanged .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70 0.70	i retired this after several years ... still did not quite impress me . a little messy . a - nice brown cola color with spotted head , intermittent . s - best feature . aroma of bananas , clove and bubble gum t - caramelized sugar , sour mash , banana m - a bit sour as you drink through the bottle , like an underripe banana , cloying sweetness d - becomes monotonous the more you drink of it . i would recommend splitting with a friend . alcohol not high enough to really give you a kick . just a little too sweet/sour for my liking .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.80	appearance : cloudy orange color with small head development on the pour . smell : sweet , candy-like aroma . taste : tangy , tuttie-fruity flavor . mouthfeel : pretty much what you would expect from an american ipa , medium-bodied and moderately bitter . drinkability : good . notes : overall a decent beer , although nothing steller for the style but okay at least .

0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60 0.60	picked this up at sunharvest in austin . a friend of mine grabbed a 6 pack of sam adams noble pils ( better choice . ) a -- golden color , clear and uniform throughout . head was one to two fingers , and dissipated into a thin foamy line pretty quickly . s -- good smell , a bit of the hops and malt . kind of smells like an ipa t -- taste was initially promising with a slight hop taste to it . unfortunately it finishes without much else . on the swallow there is a bit of a bock malty taste , but not much . not a bad taste , just not very much depth . m -- decent level of carbonation with light mouth feel . d -- not a terrible beer , nothing to write home about . i found the aftertaste slightly unpleasant , but otherwise unremarkable . i was not very impressed but also not completely disgusted . all in all , and average beer .

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.80	a : pours sub pale straw beer with a little active carbonation and a bright white head . the head actually does n't look that bad , really textured and firm on top . very clear . s : stale . as soon as i opened the bottle the air was filled with the smell of stale rice and beer , though i know this one is pretty fresh . it just smells like the morning after a frat party . i really do n't want this to be a drain pour , but i think it will be . t : this may honestly be the most tasteless beer i 've ever drank . as it sits on my tongue , i really get nothing , it 's only when i swallow i get a little tinge of bmc style bitterness . i 'm really quaffing this beer , and i get nothing at all from it . i 've tasted water from the tap with more flavor than this . m : like water , absolutely . really nothing going on here at all . d : very high . i do n't know where it 'll get you , but it 's just like drinking water . low carbonation and everything .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.70 0.80	i could not have more than one of these in a sitting without a long break . i think i might even enjoy just smelling this beer as opposed to drinking it , actually . pours a pure copper , amber . you could read a book through it , if warm . not too much of a head , so pour it however you like it . minimal lacing , as well , a hint at the fact that it does n't taste too sugary or starchy . smells profoundly of pumpkin pie before you 've had a sip , although the first sip indoctrinates you . built on a malty brown ale base , the spices fill this beer out , but all pumpkin ales are inherently unbalanced because of this , imo . you have a great variety of tastes in the same spectrum competing , and there 's just no way to let one win out , even slightly . the finish is great , but there 's just something overwhelming about the initial taste that bugs me . a beer to drink a few times every fall . get a four pack and introduce some friends to it . it 's better than most of the other attempts at pumpkin ale . maybe the fact that i typically skip the pumpkin pie at thanksgiving has something to do with it . if that 's your bag , however , definitely check this one out . this is one case where dh 's overattention to detail definitely pays off .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.60 0.40	this brew makes an impression , that 's for sure ; this bottle is the 95 vintage if i 'm reading the bottle correctly . swirling it around in my goblet , the word `` viscous '' somes to mind . a good long washing was necessary after i was done . not a bubble left . i could smell this from across the room ... potent begins to describe it . very difficult to be objective with something like this . dense raisin juice , port , sherry , cooking wine , soy sauce ... all these come to mind . very very difficult to drink at first but it got easier to drink as time went on . a beer experience , that 's for sure . definately not bland and boring . i 'm glad i got to try some .

0.70 0.60 0.70 1.00 0.80	2008 750ml poured into a unibroue tulip a - clear gold , thin ring of foam with bubbles clinging to the sides . s - very intense yeast smell , somewhat overpowering , but the tart aroma makes my mouth water . i also smell something savory and herby , like sausage ? t - sweet and herby , not nearly as tart as it smell . quite mild . somewhat citrusy , but more like orange juice than hops . m - crisp , watery , refreshing . a little zesty , but not biting as the bubbles would suggest . d - smooth , interesting and delicious . the sausage-like smell puts me off a little , but i think it would work well with a hearty dinner . i ca n't get over how mild the yeast taste ends up after that intense smell , but not breathing in through my nose transforms it from intense and weird to delicious and fun .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.80	***disclaimer*** - it has recently been brought to my attention that the beer i consumed in this ontasp review was from last years release . i have since had it fresh and it is not even similar . great brew as always- had this beer quite a bit last year . this year i 'm very let down by it . what the fuck happened to the hops ? ? ? ! ! ! poured into a pub glass forming just around an inch of off white head . lace is sticky draping over the entire surface of the glass , all the way down . the beer is transparent in a brownish copper amber with golden hues when held to light . aroma is extra malty , caramel , brown sugar , just a touch of chocolate drifting through the background . really no hops at the knose . i 'm very upset by this , this beer was amazing last year with thunderous amounts of aroma and flavor hops . aroma now is subdued with really not much going on . taste is all malt , caramel and very very minuscule amounts of orange peel and pine . i am absolutly dissatisfied with the changes . although it is still not a terrible beer , it is not even the same beer , it is nothing like it was before and i cant understand how they even thought it would be ok to brew it under the same name if it is not the same beer . i looked forward to this thing all summer and now its finally here , what a let down . i ordered one more just to make sure it was the right one or maybe a bad pour . i even bought a 6 pack on my way home to make sure . but nope , its been changed .

0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80 1.00	cheers to errantnight for this one ! pours an effervescent bronze with a finger of pearl colored head . above average head retention & lacing s : lemony with white pepper & orange peel t : follows the nose , also some breadyness & candi sugar , apple peels & general spiceyness up front . fruittyness & lemons dominate as this warms , along with white pepper & orange peel . this reminds me as much of a wit as a saison , so i will deduct half a point for that . i am picking up more the advertised spices once way warm . finishes with apple peel , lemony & herbal hops & a lovely spiceyness & just a bit of grapefruit at the apex mf : medium bodied , lively carbonation , very nice balance superb drinkabilty i could stay on this all night !

0.40 0.90 0.40 0.90 0.80	only 666 : ) : ) bottles of this beer are produced , so i am happy i could try it . when we popped the bottle , it already became clear that there would not be too much carbonation on this one . poured into a de molen sniffer . the beer pours a beautiful dark color , with absolutely no head and/or carbonation . smell : great nose , full of dark chocolate , slight sour cherry , bourbon and vanilla taste : great taste as well , this beer is very complex and still very balanced . also here , cherry and dark chocolate , dark sugar and bourbon . mouthfeel : absolutely no carbonation . medium thick . overall : i have very mixed feelings about this beer . the smell and taste are wonderful , for me it seems an attempt of the molen to produce their own cuvee delphine from struise . these beers seem very similar . but ... as jeffo also mentioned , again no carbonation . this is such a pity . this could have be a world class beer if it would just have a bit of it ... unfortunately , it is as flat as water

0.80 0.40 0.50 0.50 0.40	from colorado , to the foodery in philly , to me in ca , perhaps the long route but that 's what it takes to buy beer sometimes ! first time drinking anything from this brewery . pours beautiful , big pillows of foam that coat the glass , full , malty looking orange body and light carbonation . smell is weird , like the stalest hops i 've ever come across . sweet malty alcohol smell too . smells heavy . at first i really hated the taste , but i warmed up to it a little bit as time went by . not your typical 2xipa . the beer tastes old and stale , and it tastes like the hops were also very old when they were used . the ibu 's are way over 100 , and i 've found over the years that my favorite 2xipa 's are in the 60-80 range . as time went on , i began to see what the flavor was all about . very unique , more along the british ipa tradition , very different hop aroma . not that it assaults you , it just tastes funny . the body is creamy and sweet . note : once the funny tastes go away , the aftertaste is actually really nice and lasts over 10 minutes . my first instict was to dump it down the drain , but i 'm kinda glad i did n't once my palate adjusted . it was still just okay but it was a different kind of experience . it 's clear that this would not hold it 's own in a lineup of 2xipa 's , i would probably rate this last . i would , out of curiousity , drink this beer again . cheers !

0.90 0.40 1.00 0.80 0.80	22oz bottle a- a dark brown that allows alittle light through it . the head is small but retains for a while . s- probably the most disappointing part of this beer , the smell is so faint that i ca n't pick out any specific notes . t- it taste lightly of hops then has a good hop finish a very clean taste . m- i think it 's very drinkable and it could easily be a session beer at 1.99 each

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	12 fl oz brown bottle with standard pressure cap acquired as part of a pyramid seasonal sampler pack at ralph 's in los angeles , california , and served into a hefeweissbier glass at me gaff . reviewed live . a : pours a four finger head of fair cream and thickness , and good retention . colour is a hazy cloudy copper-gold . appealing . sm : apricot fruit ester hops . cream and wheat . wonderful aroma . really brilliantly done . moderate in strength , but fascinating . t : wonderful apricot fruit esters perfectly complement the wheat foundation . it 's a bit simple , but it 's incredibly well built and balanced for the style . i do n't often see apricot weissbiers . this one is quite a success . mf : smooth and wet , suiting the flavours of the body . dr : very easy to drink , but do take caution not to serve it too cold or it could come off watery . it 's priced very well for an out of state beer . i 'll definitely be getting this one again . it 's a real mid-range gem .

0.60 0.70 0.50 0.40 0.60	12oz . bottle poured into a normal pint glass . a : some significant lacing from not much head , and quite active carbonation . a deep golden color . s : floral spice aroma that is got a little bit of an off putting adjunct lager aroma . still a lot going on though . t : warming alcohol with a bit of bitterness . definately a belgian yeasty flavor there . lacks much of any spice characteristic . m : a denser mouthfeel then some other tripels i 've had . i 'm fine with a boozy beverage as long as there is something else there . this misses . o : not a beer i 'll be going back too . i 've loved some other victory belgian style beers before , and this one did n't match my expectations .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.70	poured into an imperial pint glass . color was a very pale golden hue with a thin white head that did n't last long . the head did leave a very small layer the entire beer . aroma reminded me of strawberry shortcake , but more strongly of strawberry syrup from strawberry ice cream topping . taste had hints of strawberry , but was mostly bland , possibly white breadish . mouthfeel was very thin and watery , with heavy carbonation levels . the bubbles tingled all over the entire mouth . easy to drink , but the carbonation detracted and turned it into a summer sipper .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.50	pours black with a brown head and light lacing smells sour with a bit of contradictory chocolate and a strong offensive alcohol essence taste is bitter cocoa , coffee , with a tartish quick finish mouthfeel is light not really drinkable , heavy and slightly offensive

0.50 0.40 0.50 0.80 0.80	you 're probably wondering where the 4 's are coming from . well , i 'm texan , and i was weened on this stuff . as the other reviews stated , its not a great beer . but it remains a standard in my fridge . i love this stuff . it pours very light yellow , with a generous head ( of course , its beer out of a can , so there 's always head ) . there 's almost no nose to speak of . what is there is a light wheaty smell . to me , it tastes like home . i 'm biased , and i will be until i 'm put in the ground . if you 're in texas , and you have to drink macro ( do n't let the review foul you , i drink local and micro when possible ) , please give this one a try . it 's cheaper than the big 3 , and has a lot more chacter . keep on drinkin '

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.70	being east coast , i 've never had a beer from oregon ( wine yes - beer no ) . and i 've never had an amber in a can . so when receiving an ashland amber from a friend , i was anxious to give it a go . a - poured a perfect copper color into a 25th anniversary bell pint glass , nice head , retention , and lacing s - i smell nothing . nothing . t - very smooth , nothing harsh , but lacking in character . little hop finish . i was expecting a bit more malt flavoring . m - good and smooth . very approachable . d - very easy drinking . half way thru , and literally looking at it as a half empty bells pint glass , i was wishing it was a bells amber .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	( 375ml bottle courtesy of zestar ! ! ) . pours cloudy bright yellow with white head . realy beautiful . aroma is funky , lemony , and maybe a little grassy . taste is tart . thin to medium bodied with a dry finish . this is just a solid offering from russian river .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.80	from a bottle , later in the night after stopping by their brewery . appearance is magenta with what seems to be a light pink bubbly head . it looks similar to a darker version of a rose champagne . the nose has cherries and some pear . while the taste has more of that , it also has a tartness to it , malts . it is a fairly sweet beer . aphrodite is both bubbly , not then has a certain syrup texture in its` finish . i enjoyed this new one from ommegang , an interesting fruit beer .

0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60	had on tap at the roosterfish as part of a flight . a : pale golden yellow in color with zero head or lacing to speak of . s : lacking in any real aroma - if i had to pick an aroma , i would say malty grain but it is/was very faint . t : this is a pretty good light beer - as was mentioned probably brewed as a light beer alternative to the nascar crowd that makes its way their a few times a year . mostly grain , some malt on the backend . m : light body , light carbonation , no aftertaste to speak of which can possibly be considered a good thing with beers of this style . o : overall this was a pretty drinkable beer . i would n't seek it out but it was good for an american blonde .

0.60 0.40 0.90 0.80 0.90	poured from a 12-ounce bottle obtained in virginia . appearance : uninteresting pale golden/yellow . lackluster head and bubbles . smell : sweet and cornlike , akin to miller high life . i 'm disappointed thus far . taste : begins to shine . begins with a nice mild hit of noble hops , rolling into a clean , refreshing lager . i was expecting some `` skunky '' element after smelling this beer , but this was happily absent . mouthfeel : good light body . inviting . leaves the palate clean . drinkability : the taste more than overcomes the off smell . this beer goes down very easily . a very simple beer with a great taste . i could drink the end of a six-pack of this as easily as the first bottle .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60	pours a nice copper reddish with a big head with staying powere . lacing clings to the glass as it slowly recedes . wheta malts dominate . seem to detect a bit of smokiness . fruity on the palate . vanilla notes . sweet malts with a nice balance of hops but not dominate . the more i drink this one , the worse it gets . very cidery for some reason .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	poured a nice clear light brown color with very little head that disaperd quickley . this smelled like the kitchen while my mom bakes banana bread . this was sweet in the begining and malty at the end with a great banana flavor all the way through . this is a beer that i would love with sunday breakfast , eggs , bacon , hashbrowns , a cinniman rool , some oj and one of theese beers . the purfict start to football day !

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	had a bottle of this given to me by a distributor at work . i had bought one a week before the new release so i know it was about a year old , it tasted horrible , the beer had definitely gone bad . i figured i would give the fresh one a shot , glad i did . a - exactly what i like to see , cloudy golden and bottle conditioned goodness . s - the smell is n't exactly pleasing at first then the orange peel , and wheat flavors build up . definitely a summer brew . t - carbonation and wheat flavors hit the palate first , followed by a refreshing taste of orange peel and citrus that is well balanced . m - lots of carbonation a bit of hops , but a generally refreshing feel , i could see me drinking this one on a 90 & # 730 ; day this summer . d - i feel that this is one of the better seasonal summer brews , and would recommend everyone to try .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.50 0.60	poured from a 750ml bomber into a snifter beer is bearing a best before end on the bottle , which i find odd for a biere de garde . a : mahogany with rich creamy head , dissipating quickly . s : caramel sweetness with hints of fruit and tobacco . t : sweet in the extreme , sweeter as it opens up . light and too thin in its flavor . aftertaste is hollowy sweet , like diet soda . f : thin , almost limp . maybe this bottle is off ? d : on re-consideration , probably not as bad as i initially reacted , but still could n't drink the whole glass . this beer was served at the recommended temperature , but i found it only to be drinkable at temperatures signifigantly below and above the recommended serving , and then , not in large quantities . i have a suspicion my bottle was off . look forward to retrying at a future date if i come across this again .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.80 0.70	consumed 04/21/08 . appearance is clear medium gold . very small ring of white bubbles around glass edges . no aroma . the flavor : imagine a hot belgian waffle with dried apples , cinnamon and powdered sugar . a bit yeasty . not a world class effort , but a strong showing . after all , how many brewpubs even try this ?

0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	appearance was average . head was between white and off-white . fully diminished head . body was cloudy and amber aroma was outstanding . moderate hoppiness and perfume . buckets of rye - i love the rye . initial flavor had a light sweetness and light bitterness . texture was quite dry . overall this beer was very crisp , dry , sparkling , and plenty of rye .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.90	found a shelf of sisyphus 2009 at central market . had to try it out and see if i should go buy more of it . poured from the bottle into a great divide balloon glass on 11/20/10 . the beer pours a hazy amber kith a nice white head that stays around for a while . nice head retention for the abv and apparent carbonation . the nose has some sweetness and faint hops , but seems a bit muted . i do n't think i have a cold or anything ... hrm . the taste is very nicely balanced . smooth citrusy american hops flow into the big , boozy backbone . i 'm starting to taste a pileup of pine in the back of my throat ... but it 's not as pleasant as the initial bite . the weight of the beer in my mouth is great . one of my favorite parts of a good barleywine . i almost miss it when i swallow the gulp . when i looked up the abv , my first thought was `` you 're fucking with me '' . if that does n't say good things about the drinkability , what would ? in all , this was a very enjoyable beer and i might have to pick up another bottle when i head back for groceries tomorrow night .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.50	dark brown brew with ruby highlights and a creamy off-white head that leaves a little splotchy lace on the glass . smells of syrupy sweetness and alcohol . i do n't like being able to smell the alcohol , it has a large negative impact on drinkability for me . heavy caramel and syrupy sweetness with a hint of roast malt with well balanced profile of resinous hops . alcohol is present , perhaps a little too powerful ( more negative drinkability ) . moderate body is slightly slick on the tongue with very delicate carbonation . strong is right , in every way . a tasty brew , but a sipper for sure , drinkability is kind of low .

0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.80	this beer is a oldfound glory . i 've always known it was solid , but recently realized i like it a lot more than i originally thought . a - goldish amber . thick white foamy head . abundant lacing . s - floral and citrus hops . t - floral notes , cirtus fruit , malty backbone . m - full bodied . blanced and smooth . great palate cleanser . d - so much flavor and so much fun . i need more of this in my life .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60	when i found out that terrapin was adding an ipa to it 's portfolio , i was very excited . as a resident of atlanta , i always look forward to supporting local breweries . however , i feel that terrapin missed the mark with this one . high points : smell - the smell out of the bottle is quite hoppy which raises your expectations on the taste of the beer . there is lots of citrus in the nose from the five hops . nice ! appearance - the beer is crystal clear with a nice foamy head . not a problem here . not so high points : taste - the taste of this beer just does n't measure up to the nice hop aroma and my expectations . the malt sweetness is a bit lacking and the hop flavor is n't quite enough for me either . it seems to me that this beer can not decide what it wants to be . it is n't a hop bomb like a stone beer and it does n't have a strong enough hop/sweet malt mix to be a well balanced ipa ( think fort collins rocky mountain ipa or sweetwater ipa ) . i think that terrapin should have kicked up the hops and the malt in this one . i will probably buy it again but i can think of 20 other ipa 's that are superior .

0.20 0.20 0.60 0.40 0.60	appearance is watered down looking with a soap bubble head . taste is weak but odd at the same time with a mild rice-sweetness . this is the kind of beer you can share with your friends because most do n't appreciate the imports anyway . i drank plenty of this is my younger days ... when you look up headache in the dictionary it reads `` drink 12 budweisers and take a nap . ''

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60	how abut a review of this beer from someone who is not a total hophead . if you honestly review this beer as an ipa it is way over the top on bitterness . if you don & # 8217 ; t compare it to any style you still have to say that it is totally out of balance . i like lagunitas maximus at 74 ibus but it has enough malt to make it work . if you & # 8217 ; re a hophead this beer may make your reach orgasm , if not you may just find the bitterness stripping the enamel off of your teeth

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90 1.00	12 oz . bottle poured into a pint glass . a-two-full-fingers , thick , brown-colored head . head receded somewhat slowly down to a consistent layer . this beer appeared almost black in the glass , but definitely showed its true deep-brown color off the pour . s-chocolate , dark berry esters . bittersweetness . t-bitter chocolate character with just a hint of choco semi-sweetness. , along with some bitter coffee coming through in the aftertaste . smokey-roasty character is prevelent , with just a hint of roasty bite . light esters provide a hint of perceived sweetness . finishes dry . m-moderate body proves to be very easy drinking . carbonation is medium-level , in line with expectations . d-so very drinkable . this porter is very densely-packed with choco-roasty malt flavors , while stil being easy and enjoyable to drink . thanks to dennis for bringing one down for me to try during our mexican dinner with tengwall .

0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80 0.80	poured from 500ml bottle into tulip glass . a : rich deep amber coloring with nice frothy head that stuck around for a little bit . really nice looking brew . s : not much on the nose , picked up some bready malt qualities but overall a little underwhelming . t & m : first thing that i picked up was the carbonation in the mouthfeel , it was quite apparent but i do n't think it really detracted from the drinking experience . taste definitely has strong malty bready qualities with a little creaminess as well . d : an enjoyable brew but nothing earthshattering . i do enjoy the fact that all pinkus brews are organic .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 1.00	i 've had this on tap followed by a growler purchase . someone need to stop the brown ale train in black mountain , nc . this is easily the best brown i 've had in my ba days . it pours to a finger of egg shell colored head , and a nice nutty aroma . the taste has a nice malt background that 's edged out with a delicate hop after taste . this is a real winner . the drinkability is off the charts .

0.70 0.70 0.30 0.40 0.40	a little cheaper than other brews at the local shop , maybe it 'll be the underdog that pulls through the odds ... pours an odd ruby red . i know i say ruby a lot , but this one is n't just a little ruby when held to the light , but its red/pink , odd for the style , but unique enough to put it over a '3 ' . head is 1 finger just off white with a medium lacing staying behind . smell is very coffee ad roasted malts , not much else . smells like many other porters i 've sniffed . still , smells robust and worth a try . taste is quite thin and the coffee does n't hit until the after taste and then its not coffee beans , but watered down starbucks . to tell the truth , there is n't really any taste at all until the finish , just a tiny hop bitterness that you feel more than taste . did i mention that chocolate never even comes up in this 'chocolate porter ' ? not impressed . mouthfeel is light and carbonated . very poor for the style . leaves a sort of film in your mouth like after cheap wine . the thing that keeps this brew from getting a lower grade is that after two it would be like drinking , well , weak starbucks coffee . i paid 3.99 for this , about as much as a starbucks ' grande coffee , though slightly more enjoyable since there alcohol involved , which you ca n't taste , which is a plus . i would not recommend this beer unless its on tap for $ 2 a pint . sorry bayhawk , i really wanted to like this one .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.20	22oz , 8 % 90 ibu . yellow label . info on the label is all about food pairings ( sharp cheddar and chili , how clever.. ) , nothing about the hops or beer itself . pours thick , looks nice . golden brown with orange , slightly hazy . thick , frothy head and lots of sticky lace chunks . smells like a pine cone dipped in honey . smells like someone went a little nuts with the centennials . homebrewy nose . first sip starts nice enough , woody , a hint of orange peel , dry with just enough malt and body.. the pine starts following through , and it 's spicy . wait a minute , it 's not stopping . quickly becomes a mouthful of dirt and ass . leaves you with an earwaxy , dry , extremely unpleasant bitterness after each sip that does not go away . personally , i am not the biggest fan of centennials , and enjoy them most when used on a smaller , single ipa scale ( two hearted , etc. ) .. well , this is a ridiculous c-bomb that is virtually undrinkable to me . i might not be able to finish this beer . i would say recommended for those of you who love the dryness and overall profile of centennial hops and can handle it in copious.. no , excessive amounts . otherwise , this beer is an f'ing disappointment after the stellar ? riddler ? .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90	i do n't usually like fruity beers especially one 's involving raspberries , in fact only apricots are a fruit that i liked in my beer . purple haze is a little different . i had it a while ago and still remember the name . i finally found a place that carried it in bottles . the smell is not overwhelming but the taste is perfectly mixed with a beer and raspberries . it 's not overbearing and does not leave you with a fowl aftertaste . it 's even good at room temperature . definitely recommend this brew .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	weak in every sence of the word , the wheat is to light , i can berly taste the blackberrys , i am not enteirly convinced that i am not drinking water , i loved this beer in the past , maby this is a bad batch . i do detect sour at the end , at least their is somthing i can detect . i could down this like water or funnel this beer if i wanted to get trashed in a hury , not a top sheilf beer

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.60	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a pint glass . a- pours a clear , copper color . produced a fingers width of white head that reduced to a thin layer on top of the beer . s- right at the front i was getting a bit of a metallic note that was not particularly welcomed . aside from that , picked up some rye , faint hint of hops , and a light candied malt aroma . t- much like the aroma , the rye is upfront and lasts throughout . midway through , some candy like malts are detectable leading the way to a miniscule amount of bittering hops . has a semi-sweet finish with a considerable amount of rye . m- light bodied with good carbonation . left the palate semi-dry . d- flavors were a little too one dimensional with the rye , making this one a little rough around the edges and unrefined . was a little hard to go back for each sip . overall , not that great of a rye pale ale . they should have given up on the pale ale portion of this beer and just made it a straight rye beer .

0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80 0.90	picked this up in westborough mass at julio 's . caught my eye when i saw stone and alchemist collaborating . the excitement turned out to be warranted , because this was an excellent beer . it makes me want to try heady topper even more so than i already do . right when i opened it the first wiff was a great strong smell of piney hops . outstanding smell . the freshness was still there . nice fresh feel and taste . a good balance of a fruit ( grapefruit ? ) as well as that hops that i smelled .

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.60	a : golden filtered color with a thick foamy head with lots of lacing down the glass . s : aromas that were kind of soft like a flower and sweet sugar . t : very weird taste and nothing like the smell . on the first sip it tasted like pizza and this coming before we got our food out and no pizza around . the second sip tasted like cough medicine and thankfully there was no strong after taste present . m/d : light and smooth feel on the mouth , drinkable but not something i will ever get again .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 1.00	the fabled gumballhead . a nice beer ... pours up crystal clear honey gold color with a frothy all white head ... .no lacing to speak of but a nice cap on the beer . the smell is predominately piney hops , not what i expect from a wheat beer but intriguing , also a bit of dry grain and some buttery notes ... diacetyl ? the taste is good not awe inspiring but good light malts up front , citrus and pine in the center , and a nice hop kick followed by some oily grain aftertaste ... decent . the mouthfeel is too watery for me ... .the smoothness of the flavor is overshadowed by the watery texture . i do have to say that on the top level..for all folks this would be a mighty quaffable entry ... you could drink these all night and keep coming back for more ... enough endearing features to keep me coming back again ... if i could pick this up in a seasonal six pack i could convert some macro drinkers in a hurry .

0.80 0.70 0.30 0.40 0.40	orange . strange smelling , hoppy with a large emphasis on fruits , apricots and peaches in particular . not much in the nose besides hops . flavor is more of the same . straight hop juice and not much else . hoppiness brings forth various fruit notes ( apricot , peach and lemon ) . dry . severely lacking malt flavor and body . fizzy .

0.70 0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40	very cloudy for an ipa , pours an orange/yellow color with a decent head that quickly backs down , but does n't recede completely . decent lacing as well . not as much head as most ipas , but still acceptable . faint smell of hops and slightly fruity though no smells are particularly potent . so far so good . unfortunately , the taste is where this starts to fall apart . again , weak on the hops although oddly still bitter despite this . perhaps there is not enough balancing with malts going on , but it 's hard to tell . it does feel nice swirling around though . overall , i would n't say this is very drinkable for me as the beer seems to be only bitter with not much else going on . what impresses me about many ipas is the ability to pound you over the head with hops while balancing it out in some way so that it 's not unpleasant . this is unpleasant with no balancing and not even that much hop flavor .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	i really ca n't decide whether i like this or not . i had good expectations for it going in , and it left me craving a tiny bit more . poured a nice hazy dark-ish yellow color with a stark white head into my dfh 22oz snifter . the nose was somewhat sweet but with highlights of citrus . an interesting merge of two different flavors in the mouthfeel . i 'm getting somewhat of a spiciness from the belgian yeast , but then back again with the hops . the candy sugar is quite evident . i 'm not a huge fan of triples but the 'blending ' between that style and an american ipa is appealing to me . however i am slightly unsure how to feel about this one . it 's definitely worth revisiting . the style in general is a good one to try ( albeit tough to find sometimes ) .

1.00 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	12.7oz bottle poured into my de struise glass ... the body is a dark copper with a hint of orange . a huge tope head rises about eight fingers , great retention and , unreal spider lacing . a huge creamy top head . body drags this done but the lacing and head so great , has to be a 5.. typical aroma from a euro trying to make an ipa , just does n't work for me at all . yeast , stale hops , a little grass , so boring with a duvel quality ... the taste is equally as bad , bitter toffee , light stale hops , way too much yeast , sour finish . this is a combo saison and belgian ipa , just does n't work . pass .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.40	well , this thing is just too sweet . thats it . honey and fruit sweets are the definitive tastes here , all the way . nice carbonation , good little head , cloudy like a belgian wheat . the flavor is soooo sweet tho , that you cant drink even this whole pint+9oz bottle . no way . i corked it and ill leave the rest for my roommate . share this beer . i mean , its not bad at all , just so damn sweet ...

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.70	12oz bottle into duvel tulip . thanks hosp . a : pours a dark amber with a large , dense , stiff , tan head that left a sheet of lace around the whole glass as it receded into a pillow-y lumpy film . s : notes of malt , pineapple , and olives ? t : light grapefruity bitter hops peak through a big caramel malt backbone . body is sweet and the finish is slightly bitter . very juicy and citrusy . m : medium body that feels `` wet '' in the mouth . very juicy . not very crisp , not very carbonated . d : not my favorite pale ale , but still nothing really wrong with the beer . fairly hoppy for a pa , but not as crisp as i would have liked .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	i knew this one was a winner from the minute it poured out of the bottle . a wonderful black color with a milk-chocolate head that seems to last forever . the aroma smells strongly of roasted barley , but some other sweet malt notes sneak through as well . the flavor backs-up the strong roasted smell with an immediate assault on your tongue . at the same instant , tons of coffee and caramel flavors arrive . however , the roasted malt is the dominant factor by far . the mouthfeel is outstanding . substantial , but not quite so thick as to confuse it with a stout . overall , i 'd say it is perfect for the style . this is a very drinkable beer , but only for those who are fans of the roasted malts . otherwise , it will likely be over-powering .

0.40 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.70	a : super aggressive pour did give a good off white head , but it had totally no retention . it was gone within 20 seconds . color is brownish red and there is no lacing . s : there is a ton of nuts and buttery esters . a lot of caramel malts are there to give a lot of sweetness as well as molasses , brown sugar and , eventually , maple syrup . dried figs and raisins are there too . heavy bread/cereal smell present . boozy . t : very strong caramel malts dominate . strong tastes of caramel , maple syrup , molasses and brown sugar are definitely there . then there is a good cereal bready taste that somewhat mixes with a tiny bit of tartness . also the nuts and butter is still there but much less present than in the smell . the fruity tastes are also a bit less present , the dried figs and raisins . also there is a medium level of earthy hops very reminiscent of what you 'd find in a barley wine . boozy . m : heavy feel with low carbonation . perfect for a malt bomb like this . d : with the booze , the heavy feel and all the sugar , it somewhat loses here . but , it 's well balanced and still go down quite easily .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60	the beer as pored was jet black with red highlights . nice tan head and good lacing . the smell was of roasted ( almost burnt ) malts , bread and alcohol . a little to overpowering and unbalanced . the taste was better than the smell as the alcohol was pushed on the background . lots of roasted/toasted malts and just a subtle bit of bitterness from the hops . needs a little better balance . the mouthfeel was very smooth & velvety . it had almost a perfect sensation for a porter . drinkability is a little tougher . why not a bad beer , goose has so many better offerings that i would rather have .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50	poured out of a 12oz . glass into a captain lawrence pint glass . a : gentle pour yields a half finger coarse light brown colored had that dissipates almost instantly , leaving nothing more than a thin white film on top . brew is a deep , almost opaque satin color . lacing is thin and stringy but present . s : a bit boozy on the nose , grapes , a slight hint of chocolate , caramel , and a subtle nuttiness . t : poured this one a little cold so i let it warm a bit ... opens a bit sour , grapes , nutty towards the middle with just a bit of chocolate . ends boozy and a bit caramel nutty but its just really too watery to tell . almost no aftertaste . m : very light bodied and coarse and crisp . finishes simple and clean with near no aftertaste . goes down real easy . d : the body helps a bit here but this is not the most impressive brew . not enough character and not enough flavor . this one is a bit too mellow for my tastes . i 'll pass on it next time .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70	750ml bottle poured into a snifter . a : black with brownish red tint at the edges when held to the light . big 2 finger head , light tan in color . very fluffy with great retention and lacing . s : alcohol and raisins . mainly alcohol . smoked maple syrup . very roasty . some coffee . light chocolate and caramel . t : roasted caramel and coffee . maple syrup and molasses . slight coffee bitterness . chocolate and raisins coming through . slight alcohol bite , not as much as the nose had . slight woody notes . m : full bodied . high carbonation . very creamy and velvety . a light sticky feeling in the end . very light alcohol sting and some warming in the belly . o : a decent beer . nothing special . i think it is a must try because it is so different . could be awesome , could be bad , but give it a shot . will probably be a lot better with some age to tame the alcohol .

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80	i generally will not buy beer in a can because of that tinny taste that it lends the beer . this one is quite bitter and void of malty sweetness so perhaps that masks that quality . one thing i like about this beer is the nitrous which makes it truly creamy . it 's not the most amazing beer i 've ever had but it 's very pleasant . it 's comforting like a mashed potatoes .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	appearance : pours a viscous , black body with a foamy , tan-colored head . smell : foremost is the oaky , redolent wine scent with large notes of roasted malts , rolled oats , chocolate , breakfast blend coffee , a drop of vanilla , and whipped heavy cream in tow . taste : rich , luscious maltiness with tastes of melted bittersweet chocolate , sweet oatmeal , and small , wooden sample-sized spoonfuls of vanilla and coffee ice cream . enter the fruity , moderately oaky , very slightly tart wine flavor with touches of homemade plum jelly and black cherry . the multitude of fine flavors all come together seamlessly . the wine character lingers into the long , sweetish finish . mouthfeel : medium-full body . medium carbonation . very velvety , very smooth mouthfeel . drinkability : it has been decided ! the grape ape ale is a very admirable , highly enjoyable wine barrel-aged brew . also , kudos to 5 seasons ( north ) for employing the use of a norton wine barrel from the tiger mountain vineyards situated in north georgia .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	not quite for the dogs , but its not far off appearance : pours a reddish-orange color , clean and smooth looking . has a foamy , tan , two finger head which takes a minute or so to dissipate and leaves some nice lacing in its wake . smell : sweet , with caramel abundant . has the scents of some spices and a slight bread undertone . definately strong on the nose , and the hops hit you as soon as you pop off the cap . taste : starts off with a bittersweet malt kick , then gets smooter and sweeter . spices are definately there , along with a very slight trace of pumpkin . has more of an alcohol taste then a lot of the marzens i 've had . mouthfeel : a little thin , not quite watery but not far from it . it 's a little too fizzy on the tongue , and the aftertaste is more bitter then the taste itself . nothing too great here . drinkability : overall , this was an ok octoberfest beer . has a different taste then the average marzen , but it 's not as good as some of them either . this is n't bad , but there is definately better out there .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	poured straight at the brewhouse , this stour poured a black , opaque with a thick tan head . smell was that if roasted malt . mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a stout , but still full bodied . very tasty , noticed chocolate and caramel as well as a bitter roasted malt aftertaste . if you get the chance to go to martha 's then this is a great stout to drink

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	22oz bomber poured into a snifter a : pours pitch black with a small dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves no real lacing on the glass . s : the nose is really nice with large amounts of dark fruits , chocolate , and the belgian yeast is in the background . as it warms you can really smell the alcohol though ... first stout i 've had that was better cold . t : the taste is excellent as well . loads of chocolate , dark fruits , and a belgian quality that really adds a nice touch to the finish . there is a slight alcohol twinge on the finish when it 's relatively cold but as it warms the alcohol is very noticeable . m : the feel is exactly how i like my imperial stouts . thick , oily , and chewy . there is a decent amount of carbonation in there as well . d : i probably should have looked at the label closer for the abv before opening this one on my own . the excellent aromas , mouthfeel , and taste keep me sipping this one though . highly recommended if you like belgian style stouts that are thick and chocolatey . take care though ... this one packs a punch . it took me 3 hours to drink this beer ... the abv is crazy . thanks to edgar for helping me out with this one !

0.60 0.80 1.00 0.70 1.00	hate to just flat out rave about this one but i have to . it may not taste the best to everyone but it tastes like nothing ive had before or since . the history behind it is amazing and the fact that it only comes in a limited release and once a year makes me have to go and buy it as soon as i see it in stores . and at 9 % abv it makes you feel like you are king midas.taste is only a little above average but everything else is an a plus .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	appearance - light amber . clear and bubbly . short white , fizzy , quickly dissipating head . smell - mild to moderate lightly toasted malt . taste - mild toasted malt with a hint of mild spiciness . dry finish . slightly watery . mouthfeel - medium and smooth . overall - not quite the hint of oktoberfest i was hoping for . inoffensive , but not real distinctive .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.60	12oz . brown bottle , purchased at jungle jim 's , poured into a snifter . a : pours a very duvel golden yellow but without as much clarity . just about 2 fingers of tight white head . decent retention , laying down to 1/4 inch for most of the drink . nice lacing . s : very fruity . bananas , strawberries , figs.. kind of all over the place . yeasty with a little bit of cellar funk . back notes of light bread . t/m : wow . very interesting . this is my first saison , haha . now that i think of it.. i have absolutely no clue what i was expecting . body is extremely thin , that 'll help the mouthfeel and drinkability , haha . the initial favors i get are very fruity , tart and sour , maybe under ripened . midway it gets very sour to the point of puckering . yeasty backbone throughout . carbonation seems fairly high . d : it 's very interesting ... i know it 's not going to be something that i drink very often but i really would like to try a few different saisons , still . local 1 comes to mind but there 's no way i 'm gon na crack open a 750 .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80	beer has a light and crisp taste with a hint of apricot . it is not as hoppy as other pale ales , nor as bitter . it is extremely easy to drink and that is what i like most about hid beer . very mild with no overpowering flavors . great beer for a light lunch or chilling with your friends on a warm day

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.60	i have a couple 22 's of this brew that were gifted to me ... my previous experience with widmer was unsatisfying but thought i 'd give it another shot . a : pours a clear amber with pretty decent head retention . a bit lighter than i expected . s : smells sweet and hoppy . however , not in a pleasing way ! the scents seem to contradict each other . i suppose you could say it 's balanced ? t : i got ta say ... very boring ... although i 'm not much of a fan of pale ales in general , i think they sweetened up too much . aftertaste is unpleasing . m : the best part of this beer . it 's got a very milky mouthfeel and an overall pleasant relationship with the tongue . overall : this beer is pretty average .

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	growler poured into a duvel tulip . see-thru orange with a massive frothy head that does n't leave crazy amounts of lacing , but is to be commended for its excellent retention . the booziness in the nose is smoothed out by a wave of sweet malts and gentle citrus notes . it certainly does n't smell outrageously hoppy , but it 's pleasant . an odd beer to figure out . it 's fairly bitter up front , but by the time the finish rolls around it has a very soft , delicate feel . fairly , but more candied fruit than zest or fresh juice . it 's flavorul , but lacking the rawness of a memorable dipa . an oddly clean finish , with booze , light toasted notes and hints of orange zest lingering . no resin , no grit , nothing really to keep you from chugging the stuff . tasty , but way too tame for the style . further evidence that excessive abv seems to be kryptonite for dipas .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	12 ounce bottle . pours cloudy orange copper color with a 1 finger off white head with very good retention with a bit of lacing on the glass . aromas of heavy floral , pine , and citrus hops with a bit of alcohol . taste is of the floral , pine , and citrus hops with some caramel notes . sweet malt flavor on the front with a lingering hop bitterness on the finish . the high abv is absolutely unnoticeable , hardly any warming on the finish . medium carbonation and body with great overall balance . fantastic offering from flying dog . i could drink this all day but i would probably die from alcohol poisoning .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.90 0.80	appearance : black as night , looks more like a porter in the glass , as you hold it to the light it looks more like a cherry coke , very dark , almost black with tinges of deep burgundy . interesting for an ale . smell : getting a grassy , earthy smell with toasted/roasted malts , faint hops , faint booze . taste : it 's like a porter meets a less hoppy ipa - it 's the weirdest combination i 've had to date which is why i like southern tier so much , these guys are incredibly talented brewers . taste on teh tongue is a faint coffee on the front followed with a slight chocolate finished with light hops - very dry . overall , i get a little earthy/grassy flavor . not my most favorite from st but definitely interesting enough to get another bottle or two . after a swig , what sits on the tongue is more of a toasted roasty taste with a little hop . not overly intense but definitely complex . mouthfeel : rich , mild to medium carbonation , creamy . drinkability : very drinkable and would do well in a tulip style of glass or even a snifter to really enjoy the complexity of the aromas . it 's a sipper , it 's very odd , it is n't one of my favorite southern tier brews but it is one i would definitely enjoy by itself before dinner , after dinner , or just relaxing on the deck at the end of a long work day . very good stuff .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60	a - dark ruby red . amazing color on this one . very small amount of head with small amounts of lacing . s - figs and raisin bread take over the nose with this beer . a slight alcohol burn is also present . t - deep dark fruits with a ton of raisin bread flavor . the alcohol is also fairly present on this one . d - at almost 12 % this would be a tough one to drink to many . but it is a great sipping beer .

0.60 0.50 0.30 0.40 0.50	this beer is always a good fallback on a saturday night at college for 2 reasons . in rochester , this stuff is dirt cheap ( $ 11 for a 30-rack ) , and of course , the higher octane of ice beers in general . now thats about as good a reason as i can find to drink this beer . its the typical light , perfeclty clear urine color that you 'd expect from a `` macro '' with plenty of not so delicious looking froth that soon dies to a struggling layer of top . the bubbles never really stop escaping the bottom of the glass . the smell is slightly reminiscent of a brewery ( ie . unfinished beer ) , which isnt necessarily good in my mind . the taste is bearable , hints of malt and yeast masked with a slightly over-alcoholic metal taste . mouthfeel when on the warmer side is slightly wretched ( like theres something caught at the back of your throat ) . in the genny line , this would be one end of the spectrum ( less taste , more alcohol ) , whereas the genny cream would be my preferred medium ( more taste , only slightly less alcohol ) . but as a denizen of the fine city of rochester , i dont have anything but praise for genny and their fine beers .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.40	this one pours a dark hickory in color with a light off white head . it 's pretty thin in consistency . the smell is just so-so . it smells of light malt , slight wheat , and light spices . the taste is better . it 's pretty sweet and a little dry . it has moderate maltiness and has a maple like sweetness . it drinks pretty light and crisp . it 's ok , nothing special and is easy to drink , although i do n't think i 'd want to have another one .

0.50 0.70 0.40 0.80 0.60	this beer is completely still . no head at all , but i guess that is to be expected with a % 17.5 beer . oddly enough , not seeing any legs either . aroma is a bit caramely with a bunch of roast and coco , very mild soy . oddly enough the taste is not as boozy or sweet as i would have expected it would be . lots of roast and some dry cocoa , nice balance of sweetness and a nice warming booziness . a bit of fruitiness , but not a ton . could use a bit of carbonation . any at all would be nice . this beer is juice flat . regardless , i was happily surprised by this beer . thought it had the potential to be a bit of a mess , but it turned out very well .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.60	served from a 22oz bomber . vessel : paulaner weizen glass a : pours an expectantly cloudy yellow topped by a thick meringue like white head . bubbles of carbonation violently race to the surface . s : lacking in the aromas you would expect from a hefe . where is the clove and banana ? a bit wheaty with just a hint of band-aid deep in the nose . t : pretty bland for a hefe . the tell tale banana and clove characteristics for the style are very muted . you get plenty of wheat , grainy character but thats about it . possibly fermented too cool for the yeast . m : creamy mouthfeel with prickly carbonation . d : drinkable but not what i was expecting from a hefe . little disappointed in fact after really enjoying other beers from olde hickory . maybe i set the bar too high . anyway , if you like a middle of the road hefe 's without too much banana or clove character then this is a hefe for you . sadly , not my cup of wheat .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.80	thanks to mikesgroove and the fight club project mayhem bif . 12 oz bottle poured into a pub glass . thick milkshake looking dark tan head . gradually recedes with thin threads of lacing on the glass . color is a dark brown/black with amber red highlights . smell has a lactose sweetness to it . there is some roasted coffee notes , but more of a light roast . taste is also milky sweet . this is almost like a milk stout with coffee than a pure coffee stout . i had this side by side with a schlafly coffee stout , schlafly has way more coffee . mouthfeel is super creamy and thick . for as thick as the body it is not as filling as i would expect . blipped `` mr coffee '' by lagwagon

0.50 0.50 0.30 0.60 0.40	pint on-tap served in a dimpled mug at the 4 seasons sports bar . this style of beer is common at brewpubs in regina . almost every one has a wheat beer , although this one is a little different . clear , dark gold-pale amber in colour . white head is just a thin ring . aroma is mild but mainly wheat and malt with a faint sweetness . i was pleasantly surprised to find out that this beer actually has some malt flavour to it . most wheat beers around here tend to be just plain bland . solid wheat profile throughout with some malt tones backing it up in the middle . finish is malt bitter with a mildly bitter aftertaste . thin watery mouthfeel with little carbonation . while this beer really is n't anything special , i did like it better than alot of other wheat beers available in regina . this was the middle of the 3 beers they have on tap . all 3 beers had exactly the same appearance so you do n't know what you 're getting until you take a sip .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.70 0.80	hello kitty ? pours a very lemony yellow color with sparkling clarity . needed lots of help with the pour and left a very bubbly , rocky head that very quickly dissipated . no lacing at all , but i guess that is ok for style . the nose is light overall . some pilsner and grainy smells . a touch of honey and limited bready aromas . some hops aromas , not to style , with a more herbal almost floral meets earthy hop aroma . the taste is delicate and light overall . a subtle grainy flavor with a lighter pilsner flavor in the undertone , nice to style . some lighter soapy touches but not overall off . some lighter bready flavors on the back end . the hops are well represented , not to style , with a bigger bitterness that hangs on through the aftertaste . some finishing hops with a more earthy feel , but hidden . nice texture with a crisp smooth taste . hit the style there . light on carbonation but very smooth with just a tad residuals . i guess for style this is a nice easy drinking beer that is to hoppy for style but still good . easy drinking for sure .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured from a 750ml bottle into a dogfish head signature glass . pearl jam is and always has been one of my all-time favorite bands and dogfish head is and always has been one of my all-time favorite breweries so when the latter released a tribute beer in honor of the former , i was very excited . decent legs and moderate lacing . a : crystal clear , pale golden color . semi-aggressive pour leads to a fluffy , pure white , 1 finger head that disappears within a minute leaving a slightly elevated ring around the top and some white swirls on top . s : big fruity nose featuring lemons , peaches , apricots , mangoes and grapes along with some bready yeast , malty undertones and just enough hop presence to make it fun . t : the fruity notes backed down a bit from the nose and the typical belgian strong pale ale flavor becomes a bit more apparent . some spicy notes such as cumin perhaps or maybe ginger but the bready yeast and malts that were noticeable but not dominant in the nose come through . i 'm not sure i know what currants taste like so i 'm not sure if i 'm able to pick them up here but i know they are a berry and i 'm quite sure they 're extra tart . this beer is definitely tart but also sweet as well if that makes any sense . m : medium bodied beer , thick sweet and sticky aftertaste . there is some pucker at the very end of the taste and if only that were more prominent , the feel would have been a bit better . o : a good beer . a nice beer with enough unique qualities to make me satisfied with the effort . i 'm not sure the style was the right choice here ( i 'm not even sure this beer fits this particular style ) but i 'm not one to question what dfh does with their brews . they are good at what they do and i appreciate each one for its special off-centered-ness and this one is no different .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.90	got this in a trade from slvrmon82 , big thanks to him for the opportunity . i think this may be a little past it 's prime but i 'm excited nonetheless . no bottled on date . enjoyed on 03/20/11 . a - what an excellent looking beer , one of the best i 've seen . red/amber color , perfectly clear , two finger bone white head that leaves an incredible wall of lace around the glass . small head with large bubbles stays for the duration . s - grapefruity , piney resin hops and a very nice malt character as well . somewhat nutty with a good candy sweet aroma . the hops still dominate for sure though even after a little while in the bottle . t - i find this beer to be perfectly balanced . very nice and sugary sweet with a great fruity hop bitterness initially . then comes a more piney hop flavor and an incredibly dry finish . i could drink this stuff all day . m - the mouthfeel is good for an amber beer , but for an imperial , as it states on the bottle , it may be just a tad thin . o - i loved this beer . this is a must-trade-for each and every year after this .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70	pours a deep brown with a small and brief head . smells of brown sugar , maybe caramels . tastes of brown sugar and toffee , a touch of smoke , and ends with flashes of milk chocolate . barely hopped , if at all . [ update : oskar blues website says they added a `` smidge of us and uk hops . '' ] tasty for sure , but a bit oversweet for my taste as the can goes on . mouthfeel : dense and creamy with low carbonation , very interesting . drinkability : good stuff but too sweet and high in alcohol to have more than one at a time .

0.60 0.30 0.20 0.30 0.30	473ml can 4.0 % abv brewed by molson breweries in canada ( it says under license but not sure how it could be under license if the same umbrella organization owns both the licensor and licensee ) i tried this beer on may 10 , 2011 after purchasing from one of my local lcbo outlets . the beer poured a translucent medium gold colour with almost no head . the aroma was sour grains , and skunk . the mouthfeel was watery with medium carbonation . the flavour was weak grains and an acidic aftertaste .

0.80 0.20 0.80 0.20 0.20	i got this in a trade a while back and as afraid to open it . my fear was justified . this was the worst beer i 've ever had . it smelled and tasted like cheap booze and nothing else . not only was his a drainpour but i could n't even swallow the first sips , i spit them out . if you like cheap booze this might be just the beer for you .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50	bought a 22oz bottle of this last week at harrington 's for $ 4.49 and i popped it on labor day , 05sep11 . color was medium copper , and it was a bit muted , or flat . had steady carbo , but the head was off white and quite thin , mostly a rim-clinger . lacing was sparse as well . aroma was somewhat fruity , though really hard to find all-in-all . body was medium , and the liquid was fairly smooth overall . flavor was ... different . had minimal malt , maybe some toasty action if you looked hard . flavors were not citrussy , or really bitter , but more like green apple and pear . this tasted more like a funky homebrew gone a bit awry . a very big `` meh '' on this one . 3.03 rdev -19.5 % look : 3.5 | smell : 3 | taste : 3 | feel : 4 | overall : 2.5 1366

0.70 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.50	bottled 7 june 2011 a : straw colored , small white head that does n't last very long . nice bubble streams s : funky and earthy . not much complexity . really working to pull much out of this . maybe a touch of diaper : - ( . t : really dry and earthy . not very tart at all . very minerally in the finish . about a third into the glass , i 'm starting to get past the mineral assault and pick up a touch of fruit , apricot perhaps , but quite mild . m : despite the bubbles , not very carbonated . maybe needs more time past the bottling date to fully condition ? palate scraping astringency . o : this is proving to be one of my least favorite gueuzes . seems pretty one-dimensional . the lack of carbonation particularly makes me wonder if i should have given this more time in the cellar to condition .

0.70 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.30	pours a strangely transparant , headless pale yellow color into my pilsner glass . the only thing obscuring my vision is the steady traffic of carbonation bubbles on their way to not reinforce the invisible head . nose is also a bit off ; it has wheat , it has spice , but it also has a vague noxious graininess that takes a bit away from the appeal . wow . something 's not right here in the taste either . broad , sweeping citrus and wheat flavors but something unidentified is making me wince as i sip it and i 'm considering not finishing it . it 's some kind of artificial tasting late breaking yeast note that just stops me in my tracks . mouthfeel is fine but this one definitely does not agree with me and i wo n't be trying it again .

0.20 0.30 0.70 0.50 0.40	drank straight from the bottle like a nerd . this is what somebody else was drinking at our sam adams taste test ( philistine ! ) and they left a cold one , so i figured , why not taste this one too ? a- i poured a little bit of it to examine the beer 's appearance , its head , etc . i 'm almost sad that i did . unimpressive pour , mixed with a bland straw color , with almost no head makes me very sad i did n't just quaff the whole sucker from the bottle . s- aggressive hops and some corn . very , very hard to pick up , as even sticking my nose into the cup bring little to no smell . t- not as bad as it looks and smells . it 's a traditional budweiser with a strong roasted corn aftertaste . downside is ... it 's a traditional budweiser . what 's up with calling it select ? also , maybe it 's sense training , but it almost has a nicotine twang to it ... very curious . m- by far the highlight of the drink . mixes around well in the mouth and coats the mouth with ease . not too much bite , but i think that 's what the brewers were going for . satisfying . d- bleech . the more i get into anheuser-busch , the more i never want to drink budweiser again . king of beers my foot . i would n't recommend this at all .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.70	a 750 ml bottle chilled and poured into a large snifter . a : slightly aggressive pour results in thin off-white head which dissipates in a minute or two . color of beer is a murky amber with very slight signs of carbonation . sparse lacing occures with good retention . s : sweet citrus scent which has a very prevelant scent of yeast . t : initial flavors are similar to that of smell , a sweet citrus flavor which leads quickly into a tart flavor from the hops . m : beer is very light on the tongue creating a very mouth-filling feeling when sipped . carbonation is definitely felt on the surface of the tongue . d : very flavorful er which goes down fairly smooth . would definitely purchase again although i wish it could be purchase in a smaller bottle from the lcbo .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	pours a brownish reddish the smell is very spicy . heavy clove/cinnamon . the taste is also very spicy . again , heavy clove and cinnamon . the mouthfeel is average . this beer is well carbonated , but is also a little watery . overall , i find this one quite drinkable for a winter spice beer . it is extrememly spicy , and probably will not satisfy the trained palate looking for a more complex , bigger winter warmer . freshness is key to this beer.. drink it up quick !

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	a - pours a hazy dark brown with a thick 2 finger tan head . s - roasted malt , stale coffee . t - tangy smoked roasted malt , anise , dry roasted astringent grain , hints of vanilla with a sour coffee flavor that adds some acidity . bitter dark chocolate with hints of tobacco . slightly astringent on the finish . m - medium body with too much carbonation . this is a tangy beer . i 've only one other baltic porter and this one stands up pretty well . it 's tangy , smokey , and dry with bits of sour to make it interesting .

0.60 0.50 1.00 0.60 0.80	12 oz bottle served in a tradition tulip ale glass this was my first adventure into the realm of belgian lambics . with no idea of what to expect , i poured this beer into a glass . before i could even get an ounce poured into the glass , the overpowering aroma of rasberries hit me like a slap across the face . overpoweringly sweet and strong aroma . are lambics supposed to be this sweet ? color was a dark cloudy red . not amber like many ales , not mahogany like a good barleywine . red . shockingly red . with some trepidation , i took the first sip . not bad , not bad at all . it is sweet and does taste overpoweingly of rasberries . smooth flavor all the way through and the sweetness does not become cloying , as i sort of expected it to . they undertones of the malt and other beer flavors are very very faint , but if you 're patient , they are there . thank god the carbonation is at a minimum . otherwise , this would seem more like a rasberry soda pop . i think i would would like it a little better with a little less rasberry .

1.00 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	bottle . pours a dark brown almost black color with a nice fluffy 2 finger head . the head is very slow to settle . the smell is cocoa nib , chocolate , vanilla , and oak with some slight booze . the head is still very impressive as it slowly settles to form a nice coaster of tan head . the taste is very complex with lots of flavors going on . slightly sweet up front followed by a mix of an oaky , earthy boozy flavors . the booze is still a little more prevalent than i would have thought for a beer with some age on it but it still has that `` hot '' flavor to it . very nice medium/heavy mouthfeel mixed some good carbonation . i am a big fan on the regular rasputin and this just takes it up a notch . good lace . the flavor is growing on me as i slowly sip on . very tasty but a sipper for sure .

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60	sampled at beachwood bbq a few days ago , had to try this beer after hearing the guys talk about it for weeks now , like nothing i have had before , certainly the first african banana gluten-free beer i have heard of , color is taste reminds me more of a thick cider , too hard to describe at times , gabe mentioned that people had been blending this and a chocolate porter and that would actually make this more enjoyable , by itself it is unique to say the least but it comes up short on being a good beer ,

0.60 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	hand carried back from brussels , purchased from the van roys . a ) very hazy peach brown glass with a halo of head . s ) wow . typical of the style , lemon juice intensity , fermented fruit , horse-blanket farmhouse extravaganza . t ) surprisingly smooth , peach nectar that has sat under a farmers house for a decade . lemon juice , farm , bit of baby diaper , hard core , but accessible . m ) puckering tartness , abrasive in some respects , medium light body , crushingly dry in the finish . d ) not a session , but i will gladly replace the bottle in my cellar .

0.20 0.40 0.20 0.70 0.40	picked up this bottle last week at hi times . pours pond water flat . like a juice . very disappointing to see this is devoid of any carbonation . the label should have provided a warning . smell is dominated by oxidation . behind that are layers of bourbon , vanilla and brown sugar . but the nose is really dominated by the smell of a beer that has not aged well in spite of this being a new release . taste is slightly more balanced but this beer still tastes like a horribly aged , improperly cellared brew . again , notes of bourbon , brown sugar and vanilla are present as well . body is fairly thick and entirely uncarbonated . overall this is an extremely disappointing beer . regular fred and fftw are so much better .

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.70	i picked this up at the pit stop in nelsonville , oh . appearance : dark amber color with a nice 1/2 '' off white head ... unfortunately this reminded me of a pop on the pour smell : pine , hops , citrus taste : kinda watery , slight citrus ( maybe cascade hops ) mouthfeel : thin drinkability : could do two in a night , but i 'd rather drink something that tastes better

0.90 0.90 1.00 0.70 0.30	well , i decided to enjoy this little wonder with my ba buddy sulldaddy , lastnight as we sat and enjoyed the march madness ! i poured half of the 95 vintage triple bock the bottle , served at 48 degrees , into a snifter , and right away i got a little `` scared '' ... .the true question was this : `` who switched our beer with motor oil ? '' which came from sulldaddy ... .we both laughed and knew we were in store for a beatdown by good ol ' sammy a . as we poured , there was absolutely no head on this beer whatsoever in my glass . i noticed at the end of the bottle , the remnance dripped from the bottle much like the last drippings of a syrup bottle , and i could already get the hints of smelling soy sauce , which i felt to be strange from a beer . as i `` took a closer look '' i also got the hints of chocolate ( rasberry ) , maple syrup , and burnt brown sugar . looking in fear , i noticed that absolutely no light got through this beer at all ! upon the first sip , after letting warm for 10 minutes first to get more flavors , i got the major taste of soy sauce , and the rasberry chocolate and maybe some maple syrup came through as well . although it had great mouthfeel and was a very interesting beer , this is a beer to open and share with about 5 people at the same time ... it is a sipping beer for real beer drinkers . it was almost too thick and sweet to drink much more than 5 oz . however , i bet it would go good with chinese food or as a marinade on some good ol ' steak or burgers ! ! ! ! yee haw ! ! !

0.90 0.90 0.40 0.90 0.80	poured into a tulip . big thanks to raznug for this bottle . an inky black body with a light beige one inch head . head dies down to an island of foam with with a ring around the edge of the glass . a cap of foam can be resurrected with a few swirls of the glass . smells of chocolate , bourbon , oak , charcoal , black currants , some oaky vanilla , and port wine . smells nice and smokey and sweet . tastes of chocolate , rum raisin ice cream , oaky vanilla , black currants , smoke , some tannins , port wine , and bourbon . the oak and tannins are pretty prominent . letting the the sweet flavors hang out in the background a little more . so here is the disappointing part about this beer . the mouthfeel is quite thin . low carbonation . wish this was a little thicker and more syrupy . quite good overall , does show it 's alcohol a bit which is just fine with me . just the mouthfeel . too darn thin . oh well , if you are looking for an exceptional ba stout that 's a little on the thin side this should be your thing .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	pours black with a fluffy tan head . head died down rather quick and disappeared . smells are of roasted malt , coffee , licorice , and a crisp sweet yeasty aroma . the initial taste is roasted coffee malt and a little bit of bitter chocolate , there is some sweetness followed by a floral hop flavor . pretty good flavors . the mouthfeel was a little bit watery . it 's not that bad though . i could definitely have a few of these . this beer is way better than the bock and in my opinion their best beer ( from what i 've tried so far ) .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	thanks urbain for the commentary on this as i drank it ! look forward to a chili version ; - ) pours pitch black with a good amount of light brown head . smells roasty and coffee heavy . sweetness masked by the powerful coffee flavours . tastes sweet but not cloying . so much roast and bitterness from the coffee that it all balances out nicely . matches perfectly with the thickness of the body . overall , a great sipper with lots of wonderful flavours

0.60 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.70	blind faith poured a cloudy amber-orange with a thick white head that stuck to the sides of the glass . the aroma is hoppy with notes of citrus and faint odors of carmel . the taste starts off with a hoppy bite that mellows nicely into a slightly sweet maltiness . the finish is slightly dry with flavors of citrus and spicy hops taking command . the aftertaste is a lingering spicy hops with hints of carmel malt and orange flavors . the mouthfeel is moderately thin with a light crispness about it . this is ( for me ) the only down side to this beer . imho this beer could stand more body . it is more like a pale pale ale with lots of color than an india pale ale . the hop profile of an india pale ale is there but not the body . but it is very drinkable and an intriguing product . i would n't turn one down .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	a : batch 002 poured from a 750 into a duvel tulip . body is golden with a solid three fingers of bright white fluffy foam on top . absentmindedly i pour out every last drop of the bottle without looking at the yeast sediment , resulting in sheets of yeast floating around . flat , 1 square inch yeast sheets cling to the beer/head division , and some of it sinks down to the carbonation nucleation point at the very bottom of the glass only to be shot back upwards by the column of bubbles ! this beer all of a sudden looks like a lava lamp ! s : overripe apples , pears , lemon , brett ( not overpowering funk though ) . t : citrus , grain , yeast . a very mellow and subtle beer . m/d : light and airy without being thin-bodied ( if that makes any sense ) . goes down really smooth and could even be sessionable . another rr beer that does n't disappoint .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90	a : big head , lacing everywhere , some liquid suspension , but settles pretty quick s : mostly chocolate , some hops , really not much t : woody chocolate , some echoes of hops m : smooth , not too thick or thin , some slight carbonation , great d : like the bottle says , it 's pretty mellow , great mouthfeel and a compelling but not too complicated taste , i could drink this all night

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	this ones a bit of a head scratcher for me - its quite a complex beer that makes you think , and it also defies our attempts to categorise it . pours a dark mahogany with resplendent red tones , and a huge creamy head that billows over the top of the glass and lays down some good lacing . a heavier retention would be my only criticism , but that aside , this looks like a tasty treat . as you would expect , the aroma goes long on the malts . i find that theres a lot of caramel , ripe dark fruit and sweet , spicy yeast on the nose . its definitely a cut above average , but does n't quite punch with the big boys , because for all its niceties it lacks the complexity of the best examples . spicy dark fruits take the form of dates , figs and raisins , while candy sugar combines with caramel to provide a sweet backing track . hints of oak and a spicy onslaught of yeast provide the depth that was lacking in the aroma . there 's a lot going on , occasionally i pick out chocolate , and then sometimes an earthiness jumps in and out . alcohol is barely discernible . one of the most marked aspects for me is the emphasis on over-ripe fruits , particularly pears and ( surprisingly ) bananas . a nice light breadiness backs everything up , and while its not as pronounced a flavour as it is in the st. bernardus dubbels , it certainly helps to provide a bit more heft and depth . the mouthfeel is something that gives me trouble . while belgian carbonation often errs to the high side of things , this is more often than not tempered by the softness of the bubbles when they hit the palate . i do n't really get that with the westmalle and the carbonation feels harsh and distracting until it dies down half way through the beer . while mouthfeel has a relatively small weighting on ba , its one of those categories that can make or break a beer , and it certainly hampered my enjoyment of this one for a while . so , westmalle dubbel has its faults , but its still a classic for the style . actually , in some respects it defies the loose style guidelines and strays over to a class of beers that include rochefort 8 . mind you , who cares about style that much ? all you need to know is that this is a decent beer and worthy of your investment in it .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.30	the good news is i think this beer may have improved from other times i remember trying it . the bad news is its still got a long way to go . dark chcocolate brown with some hungry looking foam on top . mild malt smell with hints of burnt almonds . smooth drinking taste initially but kind of falls apart after a few sips . its mild and may be improving but its still not too hot for the style .

0.80 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.30	i 've had this quite a few times on tap and in a bottle . overall this beer never gets any better . taste is a bit skunky and not a clean smooth taste like some lagers . not easy to drink too many of these . not a beer i 'm going to want again i am sure . the name suggests it is a delightful summer beer , but that is just a name , remember that !

0.60 0.30 0.70 0.50 0.50	stay thirsty my friends . amber color obviously . a bubbly off white head fades like a soda fizz and has a little lacing . sour , grainy aroma with a skunky quality . this is an adjunct type flavor . grainy and yeasty . good feel , slightly fizzy but crisp . ah , not very delicious . easy to drink but mild at best .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.60	a - caramel colored beer with an off-white head that left some minor lace behind . s - dark fruits , lot of candied sugar , caramel , belgian yeast . smells appropriate , if not a bit simple . t - tastes about like it smells . this is a pretty straight-forward and simple tasting beer . caramel , dark fruits and brown sugar . solid for the style , but nothing exceptional or particularly distinctive . m - the downfall of this beer . carbonation is way to high , almost makes the beer feel fuzzy . quite distracting , and not good . o - nothing particularly memorable , it 's okay , but the carbonation knocks down this beer considerably .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60	from a 12oz can , courtesy of arvjunk . thanks ankur ! a : pours a dark reddish brown ; cloudy-as seen through light passing through the edges of the glass ( but not much else ) . very small off-white head . s : extremely malty : caramel , toffee , and dark fruit are easily detected . as the beer warms , the dark fruit begins to stand apart from the others . t : sweetness as soon as the first drop touches my tongue ; the same elements from smell are all represented here , only stronger , and with a bit of raisin thrown in . the sweetness throws things out of balance a bit , but by no means a bad taste ( and if you prefer sweet beers , you 'll love this ) . m : medium body ; very creamy and smooth , with moderate carbonation . d : oversweetness prohibits this one from being extremely drinkable , but i never got sick of it throughout the one glass that i had . still , would not opt for another in the same night .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70	big thanks to owen49 for this extra ! live review . pours a thick ropey black . very dense , no light is showing through at all . i get a 1/4 finger of sandy head made up of round bubbles that stack upon each other like sushi roe . mild traces of mountainous lace is left behind . mmmm , this smells delicious . initially i get a large dose of roasty malt and deep charcoal notes . then the more subtle chocolate wafts in and adds depth and intrigue to the aroma of this brew . deeper inhaling reveals an earthy hop presence . cold the beer smelled of hershey chocolate syrup , warm the chocolate looses some sweetness in exchange for more of a cocoa powder profile . the taste is full of coffee notes and lots of char and ash . there is some chocolate there , but the char and the bitterness ( not positive if it 's all malt or also hop-induced ) get in the way . the bottle 's description led me to believe that this would be insanely sweet , but i find little to no notable sweetness at all . but wait , finally my beer has warmed enough to allow the more subtle flavors to come forth , and a lactic acidity begins push forth a little sweetness . the mouthfeel is a little odd . the carbonation is prickly and the finish is very bitter . it lacks some of the smoothness associated with many milk stouts . the beer grows sticky and very dry , bordering on gritty over time . the carbonation could be toned down a little , but with some swirling it calms down some . i think i prefer left hand milk stout , but this is certainly a solid offering . i really wish i could easily get my hands on some other terrapin beer .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70	originally reviewed on september 17 , 2005 . on tap at the big lake brewfest . spicy coriander aroma . burnt-sienna pour . pumpkin pie spice with lots of all spice and nutmeg , with a pulpy plant flavor that complements . aftertaste is too spiced out and dry from nutmeg or allspice .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	poured into a pint glass . ginger is one of my favorite flavors . this beer has a wonderful ginger taste , which is exactly what i would expect from a beer with this name . further , there is a decent bitterness & a slight sweetness as well . i 'm not a huge fan of spiced beers normally , but this one is really nice . recommended .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.50	served lightly chilled in a flute glass . pours a pretty rose amber color with a moderate amount of tiny bubbles escalating up the glass throughout drinking . thin off white foamy head dissipates into a thin ring quickly . smells primarily of ripe strawberries with a light scent of orange and woodiness . taste of fresh strawberries . sweet tasting , but not overly sweet . there is a light hint of orange and coriander and a slight bitterness on the back taste . it was much better than i expected . the strawberry flavor is natural . light bodied , champagne-like , with the right amount of carbonation . the downfall is that it is too sticky . it leaves your mouth and lips sticky ; but it does n't taste sticky . the flavor is very short lived ; the taste is long gone and the stickiness remains . the mouthfeel makes this beer much less drinkable . the taste and smell are commendable .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.40	the pour appears as if it were cloudy lemon-water . the head laces well , but is generally quite shallow . during the pour and again upon inspection is an overwhelming and sharp citrus aroma - both lemon and lime with a dash of spice . quite confroting . the flavour is not far removed from the aroma , and is far from favourable . it fits in with lime , chelada and other gimmick summer-season brews ( such as miller chill , from australia ) . the mouthfeel is the most appealing part of this brew , unfortunately i just ca n't escape the sour flavour . not recommended , unless of course you 're into those unbalanced single-flavour-heavy summer soda-beers .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	served at cellar temperature in an imperial pint glass . appearance- pours a dark ruby tinged chestnut hue , while the head explodes to three fingers ' thickness with some audible volume . the crown 's cafe-con-leche color is soapy and well defined , sticking nicely to the inside of the glass . thick and stalwart , a bully among oatmeal stouts . smell- a hop-forward take on the style , this fresh example offers a resinous , leafy , quite green aroma of hop oils . secondly , and only after some exposure to air , the roasted coffee notes begin their advancement . i like the hops upfront with this beer . taste- extraordinary balance of all ingredients , beginning with a restrained , yet aggressive display of hops that tease the tastebuds . during the swallow and while exhaling , the incredibly smooth roasted coffee and bitter chocolate notes make their debut ... then concede once again to an easy , perfectly finishing hop bite . between sips and gentle burps , the atmosphere inside the mouth is quiet yet very alert . mouthfeel- the texture of this beer in the mouth is stunning and absolutely *perfect* . the effervescence nibbles and pricks the tongue immediately , then it washes over and becomes the most gentle , sublime example of any beer that i can remember . for the style , no other oatmeal stout touches this . drinkability- my glass is empty .

0.60 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.60	a - thin , yet long lasting 1/2 finger white head . very hazy , looks a lot like apple cider . s - citric hops and sweeet malts . very sweet . copping a yeasty/alcohol undertone that i 'm not totally diggin . t - a definite hopbomb . not bad , though . semi-complex hop profile ... i 'm thinking my sample may be a little old . malt backbone is very very big , and noticeable . almost nutty . starts bitter and piney , finishes bitter and slightly metallic with huge malty sweetness through the last half of the sip . m - perfect . exactly how a dipa should be . thick but not syrupy , medium carbonation , slick and oily . ca n't get better . d - if it were n't so big ( abv-wise ) , and did n't have such a sweet maltiness , i 'd rate it a bit higher . it has the chance to get slightly cloying . i can see myself putting down a bomber now and again if it 's available , but i do n't think i 'll be hunting for it .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.90 0.60	this beer scared the shit out of me after opening it . no pop ... none zero zip , alway a bad sign , and i had never heard of it and i got it in the mail on a beer trade . still i love lambiks , so i sipped deeply and bravely ! wow , i got everything from strawberry 's to lighter fluid out of this one . i am going to drink this whole bottle , if this is my last post , you will know the lighter fluid flavor means do not drink it . very sweet and sour , i actually really like it.the `` off tastes are becoming more pronounced as i drink it , but that might be my imagination ... brb..better check out some other reviews ! ok read through a few looks like i agree with both ends of the spectrum . this beer is both amazing and horrid . i lean toward amazing in-spite of my stomach cramps ... strangest beer i ever tried .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70	poured with a gorgeous chocolate colored head of a modest size with lacing reluctantly hanging onto the glass . looks very attractive . there is chocolate in the aroma , creamy milk chocolate . earthy undertones . the taste is smooth chocolaty , earthy , with a few rough edges around the chewy oat flavor . for the mouthfeel , i found this stout almost watery in consistency . it is a kind of refreshing effect.. but i 'm not sure if i could get used to a stout that is this thin . but on a hot summer night this may be the right choice for a stout . .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.70	this stout pours a nice black color with reddish hues around the edges . there is a small off white head that disappears quickly . its aroma is of roasted malt and tastes very similar to its aroma . dark roasted malt is the main character with a bitter chocolate flavor as well . the hops are by no means intense , but are very pronounced for a stout . the sweet chocolate and coffee flavors are mild , but do surface near the finish . the mouth feel is very light for a stout , but remains a nice and drinkable brew . this makes a nice addition to the holiday 12 pack . i just think that it needs a thicker body .

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.80	appearance : light yellow in color with a 1 '' head that breaks apart immediately . smell : little grass and hint of lemon is all you can pull from the glass . taste : grainy malt profile with a hint of lemon zest and grass . bitterness is very mild . mouthfeel : light in body . very crisp throughout that creates a nice refreshing feeling . aftertaste is clean . drinkability : very easy to drink but it down a notch as the flavor profile is a bit weak in flavor overall .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70	doopie brought this one over for us to quaff while watching the 2nd leg of bayern - inter last night . awesome game ! from a bomber into a snifter vintage : 2010 note : drunk right after a 2009 bottle of bcbs . appearance : pours out black , but not quite pitch black . the pour produces a cascading finger mocha colored head that magically appears out of nowhere . jet black body with very little carbonation . head quickly fades to nothing and a ring around the edges of the glass . a slight ring remains until the end and leaves no lacing . looks good for the style , but the lack of lace keeps from going any further . looks exactly the same as the regular bourbon county . smell : lots of bourbon in the nose with vanilla and wood notes as well . a bit or roasted malts in there too , but this is all about the whisky . the vanilla is certainly there and adds to the show without dominating it . a nice nose , but not quite as bold and forthcoming as the regular version . taste : everything from the base beer is here , but a touch more vanilla . and by `` a touch , '' i really do mean just a touch . a roasted malt base supports a big barrel , with lots of sweet milk chocolate , vanilla , bourbon and oak flavors . the aftertaste is big , bold and lingering , with lots of barrel and a touch of vanilla sugars meshing well with the rest of the flavors . the vanilla has done well in mellowing the brew , as there 's not as much heat and booze as the regular version . palate : perhaps even thinner than the regular version . very thin and light for the style . not creamy or smooth enough , lots of prickly carbonation , and somewhat airy on the palate . goes down fine , but is abrasive at the swallow with a bit of a burn . some heat at the swallow , though not as rough as the regular , and finishes slightly sticky . definitely needs a bigger body . overall : a tasty treat for sure . though the vanilla flavors could have been a touch more prevalent for my tastes , this variant was mellower and less abrasive than the regular version we 'd drunk right before it , making it slightly easier to drink . the palate was still way too light and thin for the style , and the look nothing to write home about , but the nose and taste profile certainly made for an enjoyable drink . this is one i would n't pass up on , but do n't think i 'll be trying to seek it out . thanks heaps for sharing this one doopie . good times !

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	on tap at the original se brewery location , served in an imperial pint nonic . handsome beer . pale gold body with a finger of almost white head . the head reduces to a skim quickly , but is easily revived with a swirl and gives some decent lacing . nice crisp bouquet of floral and herbal hops , with a light and delicate sweet malt accompaniment . straightforward and inviting . taste is perhaps a bit tame for west coast ipa standards , but that does n't mean it 's not good ( it certainly is ) . quite a nice subtle and balanced brew- the hops are floral and citrusy without introducing the pucker factor , while the malt backbone is bready and lightly sweet . light-moderate bodied with medium carbonation . solid mouthfeel , nothing noteworthy , but nothing wrong with it . overall impression : good example of a balanced ipa . extremely drinkable brew that 's sessionable and tastes great .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.70	a - poured a two-fingers thick , bubbly , coffee-colored head into a pub glass that left a thin ring and decent lacing but both disappeared 1/4 of the way through . the body was dark black . s - roasted chocolate and other malts . t - caramel , roasted chocolate and other grains , with a hint of smokiness and cherry . m - crisp and sharp at first but gets very thick and chewy . best feature of this beer . o - good beer overall and one i 'd go to again . kudos to rogue for gyo .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.90 0.90	great beer , had it at the yard house in southern california . went in during happy hour and sampled it . went really well on a hot afternoon . best i can compare it to is bread , chocolate , milky , beer . i really enjoyed the initial taste . i feel that it felt a little light on the tongue after it went down . a friend disageed with my opinion though so please decide for yourself . this hsbeen hard to find and i strongly recommend ordering it if you find it on tap . either way , you will not be disappointed in this beer .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.30 0.30	appearance : this beer pours thick black motor oil with absolutely no head whatsoever . extreme tan and tar-like legs . seems like this beer will end up staining my clear snifter . smell : the aromas are god alwful ! but good in the sence that it smells like a cooking sauce such as mesquite barbque sauce and worcestershire steak sauce . chocolate , over abundant vanilla , and maple syrup . also cleansing alcohol fumes are noted . taste : oh my god , total wreck ! the flavors are red wine vinegar , a blend of every cooking sauce and spice all rolled into one . with alcohol fumes that are to the roof . on a plus note the aftermath settles to a mercifull dark and bitter chocolate finish with hints of maple vanilla and mint that linger . mouthfeel : can you say fat ? this monster is thick and chewy and oh so full . i forget that im drinking a `` beer '' . drinkability : low drinkability to say the least . as it warmed i must admit that i had a tough time finishing it . if anything i procured quite a nice buzz . its ok to experience this once but never again . cheers2beers

0.40 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60	wow , a truley unimpressive beer . heineken pours a golden straw color with an instantly-flattening head . after a minute , there was no head to be found at all and it looked like i could be drinking a pint of apple juice . smell and taste are strangly metallic , with a hint of sweetness . tastes sort of corney , too . i find it amazing how widespread and popular this beer is . great marketing , i guess .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60	a - golden appearance with moderate carbonation . faint head . s - there is a presence of some noble hops , but not all that impressive . for a specialty craft , brew , the smell is nothing more impressive than any other macro-brew . t - big let down in my opinion . understandably , when you buy a golden/ blonde ale , it will be invariably be weaker than an ipa or esb . but , this beer 's taste is not noticeably different than any pilsner on the market . in fact , my favorite cheap beer pabst has more flavor going on . m - typical pilsner/ale mouthfeel with a solid carbonated feel . could definitely see myself drinking by the pool , but could not justify the price for my personal rating . d - as easy to drink as any macro-brew . sad to say it is produced by a brewery that should have surpassed that . note : do n't but this beer - waste of time .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	undated stubby 12oz twist top , poured into a pint . black with a two finger head that is tan and shows strong retention and thick , ringed sheets of foam that coat the glass as it goes down . smells of rye toast , roasted malt , and something close to blueberries . there 's a floral hop aroma in the background . has the roasted malt flavor that is found in really good porters . there 's a good dose of dry hops that hang on through the finish , but the rye taste is there from begining to end . has a malty , stout-like mouthfeel . i could sip this all night .

0.60 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.60	pours a clear amber with a small thin head . very little retention or lacing . i was really hoping it would be purple . smells wonderfully of grapes . a lot like grape soda . very appealing . a bit of grape at the start but then it just kind of changes over and sits there . i get a little pale malt , a bunch of carbonation , and not much in the way of hop . just turns to bubbles in my mouth . mouthfeel is thin at best . lots of fizz . not much in the way of texture that 's enjoyable . lots of people love this stuff . it 's just not my thing . however , everything else i 've had by concorde is top shelf .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90	i was very excited to see this when i was at the store today ! poured into a pint glass . a : pours much lighter than most browns , appears a deep mahogany with striking clarity , foamy white head that has decent retention s : the smell is full of deep roasted barley and other malty notes , reminds me a bit of a dry stout , some nuttiness along with a bit of sweetness towards the end . this has quite a unique aroma which i am really digging . t : the front features the roasted grains that i picked up on the nose , and then it gives way to a bit of sweetness along with a swift dash of hops . the complexity of this brew has taken me a bit by surprise , but i must say it is in a good way . mf : a bit thin , light body , medium to high carbonation d : another winner from sierra nevada . this brown ale features an array of wonderfully balanced flavors and is a welcome addition to the seasonal lineup .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	a : looks exactly like a good stout . would never think this was a brown ale . black as night with thin white head . s : smells like a strong porter to me . heavy coffee and dark chocolate with good dose of vanilla mixed in . molasses and alochol . t/m : mouthfeel is perfect on this beer . heavy and thick but silky smooth with right amount of carbonation . start out with with almost a belgian pehnolic prickly taste with some cedar , fading quickly to smooth dark chocolate vanilla comes through at end and then slight alcohol perception with some hop spiciness . semi-long finish is all chocolate and vanilla with slight alochol sting . beer is extremely smooth with all flavors nicely in balance . d : good for abv . ovr : i 'm not a huge dfh fan , though i agree most of their beers are solid , some even really good . this is prbably me favorite so far . i think of this as a stout , or robust porter , and the flavros are great and in complete balance . i 'll age a few of these , and i can only imagine hwo smooth this will be with a year on it .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80	a : pours amber-tinted copper color with a foamy coffee creamer-colored heat . random patches of sheet lacing . s : inviting smell of honey roasted pecans , sugar and salt . t : toasted carmel malts , fairly sweet throughout . finish is nutty , slightly dry , lingering nutty aftertaste . m : slight to medium bodied , moderate carbonation , a little too prickly . d : this is a nice , light , sessionable brew . the taste falls a bit short of expectations given the phenomenal smell . i would not turn one of these down , however .

0.90 0.50 0.90 0.90 0.50	poured oil black with a huge frothy brown head up top . good looking brew . smells roasty , earthy , and malty . some sweetness as well . relatively straight forward flavors . dark roasted bitter combined with a `` dirt '' or earthy tone . bitter and astringent mouthfeel that 's surprisingly ... welcome . good drinkability other than the bitterness .

1.00 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70	12 oz foiled bottle courtasy of jrallen34 , thanks ! so far this is only my second new glarus beer , but both have been quite tasty considering they are n't my favorite styles . a - pours a cloudy golden color with 1 finger off white head . lacing is nice as is retention . s - smells very yeasty and estery as standard for the style . some banana and clove . t - a pleasent yeasty flavor with banana , clove , and a touch of orange zest . very little alcohol is detectable considering the 9.6 % . i had to do a double take of the percentage , since i thought it was much lower . m - mouthfeel is not very pleasant . moderate to high astringency and a thin body . singing bubbles and loose bubble structure did n't make it better . o - a nice beer that is dangerously drinkable considering the alcohol level .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 1.00	i had one from the bottle last night and regularly drink it on tap . great aussie example of czech pils . huge white head and golden in colour with the aroma of hops - note that the aroma quickly drops off with age . the flavour is lead by malt with some notes of butterscotch ( melanoidin & some diaceytal ) and is balance with moderate to strong bitterness and hop flavour . mouth feel is reasonably rich . i 'm lucky enough to live 100m from the brewery and the local pubs turns over the keg pretty quickly so i always get it fresh . i do n't think it travels well folks !

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.80 0.80	poured a massive tan frothy head ( granted it was a bit warmer ) but retained itself at a half finger for quite a while . very dark , almost black , but not hazy . smells of well roasted malts , faintly earthy and a bit of iron . taste is nothing too exceptional , but very well-balanced . alcohol is very well masked for a 6.5 % way too much carbonation for my liking . feels like a dead beer saturated with co2 it 's actually quite drinkable , very light for a scottish ... i definitely would n't turn it down . i would check it out if your interested in western new york beers , but do n't go out of your way for it .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	4/07 9.6 % imperial golden ale with earthwork honey and sunflower seeds 750ml as orange as you can get short of red . only golden in the way the sky is when the sun rises and illuminates a dark sky . enough poetry , more beer . solid ring of tight bubblage and some wispy islands of film float atop the viscous brew . smells like a traditional belgian strong gold , duvellian if you will . something about it is different though , more autumnal . the honey is there along with burnt candy corn , kettle cooked popcorn and fresh-fried doughnuts . sipping is rather nice , mouthfeel is brisk with carbonation skillfully coating the alcohol notes . a bit boozy still , i 'm enjoying the tart sweetness of fermented honey . looking for those sunflower seeds , not really apparent at first . in the finish , though , i notice a roastiness that does n't match the malt profile here . yeah , that 's sunflower . if you 've ever had anything with/fried in sunflower oil , you 'll catch wind of the utilization here . i 'm glad it 's not more , those nuances would work better when strongly applied in a stout perhaps . here , it 's just one more flavor to wrap your mind around . and now that i think about it , the popcorn in the nose could be related . judged as an option to la fin or duvel or something similar , it 's a fucking home run . as something 'freaky ' , i was certainly expecting more but completely satisfied nonetheless . highly recommended , as have most beers in this series been .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	port brewing santa 's little helper , bomber , courtesy of ba user plenum ( trade ) . appearance : served in a sierra snifter , the pour produces an out-of-control head , several fingers in height . after some crowd-control , it comes down to two fingers , but still , very exuberant and unexpected for an imperial stout . color is very black and absolutely opaque , with a classic tan head that recedes and remains as a brownish rim around the glass and remarkable lacing . smell : subdued , some bitterness , roastiness . coffee , chocolate , booze . dairy . the classics . a tad of bourbon and wood , even though this is not aged/barreled . a lot of reviewers say the nose is too boozy- i do n't see that . taste : that wood/bourbon thing that was on the nose continues here , subtle but present for sure . bitter/astringent/pungent , but nice . some chocolate and coffee . mouthfeel : probably my favorite part of this beer . lightly carbonated , a bit of a burn at the end , bitter throughout , chocolaty and just oh-so-pleasant all around . very well balanced , incredibly delicious . full flavor and body , nice dry finish that lingers around the lips . drinkability : a sipper for sure , but i think the alcohol is perfectly well hidden , not overpowering as others say . i would n't chug this , but as a nice sipping beer , it is unbeatable . well done ! i love this one a lot , despite the fact that it is actually all over the board ...

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	this stout was smooth and creamy but had a very thin and metallic mouthfeel . thick beige had and nice lacing but this one was lacking somehow . it just needs to be a little more rounded .

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60	( on draught at rock bottom arrowhead . now called red ale ) . pours a clear amber color with a creamy off-white head that leaves some lacing . moderate carbonation . aroma has dark pit fruits , caramel and florals . taste is sweet with some light bitterness . medium bodied , but watery . bitter finish . this is an ok beer .

1.00 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	a - amazing . it was the typical color or an ris with just a tiny hint of ruby on the fringes when held in front of a light with a stiff , slowly fading 2.5cm head . s - dark chocolate ( or maybe semi-sweet ) and roasted barley . there may have been something else going on here , but i have a sinus infection , so my smell is slightly off . t - okay , it 's definitely dark chocolate followed by a small hop flavor . after a few drinks , a coffee taste is noticeable , as well as a smokiness or burnt barley flavor . m - perfect carbonation . it 's thick and really , really creamy . it 's probably the best mouthfeel/texture i 've ever had in a bottled ris . d - pretty good . the abv is low and beer is n't quite as filling as other riss . eh , this is a pretty good ris . if you 're new to the style , i 'd recommend trying it just so you can prep yourself for the flavor overload of other riss . it 's one to try , but i 'm not crazy about it .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90	brilliantly clear from the ample lagering , reddish bronze in hue , topped by a fluffy , slowly receding head . loose lace is left . buttery , nutty malt sweetness from the combination of munich and medium caramel malt dominates the aroma , w/ herbal hallertauer providing contrast . light hint of fruity melanoidins add complexity . a snap of bright , ripe raspberry like fruitiness quickly widens into a malt profile comprised of lightly toasty munich , and a clean , pleasant caramel sweetness . herbal , slightly earthy hop flavor and mild hop bitterness dart into the flavor profile as the initial malty sweetness fades . perhaps a touch lacking in body , but dextrinous enough to help facilitate excellent drinkability . finishes lightly sweet and grainy , but otherwise clean . although stoudts fest falls a touch short in malt character and body , but is nonetheless a well crafted , tasty and highly quaffable brew .

0.80 0.90 0.20 0.20 0.20	i could n't stop laughing as the bottle was stroked by a man with epic hipster sideburns . that pink is ... vibrant . pours a perfect amber . wait , amber ? i mean , it is pretty , but i was expecting a deep brown ale , not a transparent glass . oh , and by glass i mean a 4oz taster . the smell is amazing , maple candy and sugar . no depth , no smoke , just motherpumpingmaple . the taste is the same , but a hair of smoke in the background . so . fricken . sweet . not as sweet as the hipster sideburns though . i cant go on . i dump half the tasting glass in the grass and search for something to clean out my mouth .

0.80 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.20	artied2 picked this up recently , and he stopped by tonight to share this with me . bottled 19mar10 , batch # 1 , bottle 44 of 204 . poured about 11oz each into a small tulip . color was an opaque , deep brown , like the crude gushing into the gulf . head was creamy and tan , though it ebbed quickly to a thin rim-job . no lacing to speak of , though . aroma was very nice ( the best part , in retrospect ! ) . there 's lots of choco here , with roasty coffee and some inviting bitterness . looked and smelled like a stout . body was a little thinner than medium , yet it was still fairly smooth going down . taste ? welll ... . both artied2 and i looked at each other after our first quaffs . uh-oh ! it 's verry dry ; no sweetness at all . there 's some chocolate there , but it 's like an overly bitter dark choco . lots of burnt , charred notes come in , with a sourish , off-putting attack on the palate at the finish . almost medicinal or , as the boy said , chemical-like . artie gave me the rest of his , and i could n't finish either . even alewife took a short sip and said `` nope '' ... but it does look and smell good ... . prosit ! ! 2.85 look : 4 | smell : 4 | taste : 2 | feel : 3.5 | drink : 1 1253

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	on tap at the cbc airport pub . golden color with a thin off-white head and thin spotty lacing . lager-ish smell , with mild hops and earthy malt . light-bodied and crisp with a mildly hoppy flavor that is short-lived . there is a bit of malt in the background too . the finish is dry and lightly bitter . pretty average but a nice find at the airport .

0.30 0.90 0.20 0.70 0.40	appearance : pours a dark chocolate brown color with ruby highlights but , as others have commented , no head smell : oh , what this could have been - dark chocolate , dark fruit ( figs and prunes ) , dark coffee taste : dark chocolate up front , with the dark fruits appearing shortly thereafter ; by mid-palate , the alcohol starts to impact the flavor ; after the swallow , the chocolate and coffee elements provide a flavorful finish , but it tastes slightly chalky mouthfeel : thick body but flat ; warmth in the gullet drinkability : perhaps coastal extreme got confused by the wine bottle and the cork into thinking this was supposed to be an extreme wine ; i 'm surprised that after all these years , they seem to have such quality control issues with their products thanks , themaniacalone , for the opportunity

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	poured from a corked and capped one pint 9.4 oz bottle . the cork had 2004 pressed into it . appearance- pours a good head into my leffe goblet with good retention . but it does eventually lead to no filmy foam . very brillaint lacing . color is a hazy , almost opaque orange peel hue . smell- the brothers say yeasty is a a bad thing to smell . a yeast infection smell is indeed quiet disheartening to say the least . but a mix of yeast , coriander , and orange zest is quiet the opposite . taste- starts uot as a good mix of sugar and wheat . this then leads into a slightly sweet citrus with a hard to finger hop character . the finish is a mix of a heffe-like palate mixed with herbs . mouthfeel- the carbonation was phenomenal and helped excentuate the citrusy , herbal flavors . the label said it was a saison , and i would agree for the most part impo , but this is depbateable .

0.60 1.00 0.70 1.00 1.00	i had this on-tap at the pour house for $ 4.28 , and it was in a regular pint glass this beer starts out ok , has a beautiful opaque black look , but head could be a little bit better . lacing is decent though . the smell is mocha and the taste is mocha , with a bit of chocolate and dare i say even some plum . the mouthfeel was not overly heavy , but also very dry and alcoholic , but it leads to heavy drinkability . overall , this is another great seasonal from my homestate , get it now because by march , it will be all gone . i just wish i could get a growler of this stuff .

0.80 1.00 1.00 0.80 0.90	upon opening this beer , it promptly nearly exploded with almost 1/3 escaping on to the floor . hmm . a : hazy nut brown in color , with a sizeable head of medium size bubbles . s : very pale aleish , although sweeter . does n't smell like an amber at all to me . just a tad sweet , hints of fruit , but nothing overwhelming . it 's really a perfect smell for this kind of beer . t : does n't live up to the smell , but quite good . it 's very similar to sierra nevada 's pale ale , although slightly less bitter . very hoppy . m : very nice , almost foamy when it goes down , but somehow not . interesting and very pleasant . d : very drinkable , great beer . just as good as sierra nevada 's pale ale , and very similar . i 'm surprised no one has posted a pic yet . i bought it because the bottle was so beautiful , will have to post one ... .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured a rich straw-gold into a tulip with a finger of fluffy white head . complex , tea-like aroma of mint , black tea , and spice . lowish carbonation and a light , smooth mouthfeel . more complex notes of mint , cucumber , and parsley . occasionally picked up some slight grass , lemon , pilsener-like notes . dry cucumber finish with a hint of funky belgian spice , perhaps due to the rye . not much hop presence that i could detect , but a very intriguing brew nonetheless . i found the finish to be a little sour at first , but this improved greatly as the beer warmed . another memorable offering from epic ales !

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.50	my god the label looks way to close to alaska brewing label . i am having this in a 7 beer sampler here at the brewery on tap . it is beyond dark and ca n't see light in it at all . light cream color thick head . smells like nothing . i got zero smell from it taste- first flavor is water . almost no flavor except what came from the head . there is nothing of coffee or expresso like you would think . i came here for flavor . really disappointed . after a little it did have a mild bite . a hoppy bite . really ?

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.40 0.40	thanks nic , for giving me the opportunity to try a beer i never would have tried on my own ( nor will again ) . pours a light amber color , with a small white head . on the nose , this one is very acidic , sour and barnyard-y . thin on the palate , acidic , vinegar .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.90	poured a rich copper ale with a white fluffy head that subsided quickly with no lace . the aroma is next to perfect with a beautiful blend of rich english malt , a fine hop nose , and that distinct english mineral character . the flavor is also good with a sweet malt in the begining which quickly segues into a quick touch of hops and a clean , dry finish . the body is the only flaw i have with this beer as it seems a little bit too light but the carbonation is perfect leaving the beer with very little carbonic bite and a nice pseudo-cask conditioned feel to it . this beer is highly drinkable and i would easilly order a couple pints as it has a very clean finish .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	i drink fat tire on a fairly regular basis , though not as often as last year when they first arrived back in mn . these notes are based on a pair of pints i had on tap at major 's in golden valley ( not exactly a beer bar , but they go through enough ft to keep it from going stale , i 'd think ) . appearance : i did not dock the beer points for appearance , since my guess would be the absence of head was due to a bad pour and dirty glassware . i know from past tastings that ft produces a nice , light head with moderate retention . even on the spotty glass , the lacing was great ( as it usually is ) . very nice dark copper hue , bright and clear . smell : sweet , biscuity aroma . a little like graham crackers dipped in a mixture of munich malt and honey . taste : more of the same biscuit notes , but the sweetness has an acidity to it , like apples . mouthfeel : i 've always thought this was a little off ... not quite enough spine to offset the sweetness . drinkability : i could ( and have ) drink a healthy quantity of these in a session and be happy .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	when poured into my pint glass this beer looked like a soft drink , with lots of bubbles along the sides of the glass . it settled down to dark brown with ruby edges . the smell after a fresh pour was way more macro lager-like than normal guinness . after a while i got some chocolate and fruit . same goes for the taste , which in my opinion is worse than the draught version . as many others have said , i 'm not liking the extra carbonation . i could drink a few of these ( which i will , i bought a six pack ) but wo n't be picking this up again .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	pours dark brown , black in the glass , with a creamy coffee colored head . leaves nice lacing all over the sides of my snifter . aromas of roasted barley and malts , as well as various dark fruits . hints of raisin . roasted malts and coffee assault the taste buds . semi chocolate and molasses in the background with hop bitterness rounding everything out . thick and creamy . everything i look for in an imperial stout . light carbonation . abv is well masked . 10.5 % ? really ! ? got ta be careful with this one . this stout tastes great and goes down easily . the smell is on the complex side , but the taste is straightforward and solid .

0.80 0.50 0.90 0.70 0.80	pours a golden straw color with a lot of white fluffy head that sticks around for a while . there 's a lot of bubbles coming out of this thing . smells faintly of yeast and a tiny bit floral . the taste is fairly sweet with a little hoppy flavor but not a lot of bitterness . it balances out pretty well . the mouthfeel is creamier than i thought it would be , very nice . overall , it 's very drinkable , very nice for a hot day .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	pours cloudy golden yellow - very active fizz , but develops a small head with no noticable lacing . very pleasing smell - bananas , citrus , yeast , bread . its all in there . the taste is classic hefe - citrusy with a lingering yeast taste . some tartness . little noticable hop taste . less fizzy than anticipated in the mouth . a very drinkable hefe - drinking mine a little out of season ( not necessarily the ideal winter beer - can imagine having this after mowing the lawn .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	this beer pours a nice dark , healthy looking amber , as the name suggests . two fingers of nice thick white head form , but dissipate quickly , leaving a thin lacing that grabs the glass . smell is modest- malt , slight hops . mouthfeel is exceptional ! this beer is smooth , silky , creamy . not expected , and awesome . warmness from the spicy hops tops it off perfectly . taste is great- warm , malty sweetness from the caramel malt is balanced off beautifully by the hops , but its not overpowered of bitter . finish is smooth . i freaking loved this brew .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80	from notes , dec 2010 . pours a deep coffee brown with a one-finger light-brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice little cap of bubbles . smell is coffee and roasted malt , a good combo of coffee and porter . taste is good , rich , with a great balance of coffee , roasted malt , anda a bit of hops to even it out . nicely complex , balanced flavor . the main downside is mouthfeel , which is far too light and bubbly for this style of beer . overall , a great beer , with solid flavor , but it does n't quite feel right in the mouth for a porter .

0.50 0.70 0.30 0.50 0.40	a : a rather odd appearance for this style as it pours more like a wheat beer with a thick haze and a yellow color s : the smell is dominated by a spicy/earthy hop aroma and a background of grainy husks t : there is a spicy flavor with some hints of citrus and a malty sweetness . there is also a grainy flavor coming through m : medium light body with a slick feel . there is an astringency from they grainy flavor that sticks with you after the you 've swallowed . d : this is an odd beer for the style ... normally i could care less as long as its good but this beer seems to have actual brewing flaws . i am positive the boys at bell 's know what they 're doing but the grainy astringency kind of overshadows the whole beer and it tastes oversparged . i do n't know , you be the judge

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.60	from january 7th 2010 notes . a careful pour of half of this 500ml bottle created monster head . there are also some huge bubbles sitting on the remaining liquid in the bottle . a- mud brown with an auburn tint . giant head died down to an okay 3mm leaving sprinkled lacing . subsequent gentle pours always ended in huge head . pretty cool . s- malt and hops . alcohol . something reminds me of a pilsner . i also smell something rotten like compost or a fart ... t- bitter all the way . tastes a little soapy or some other sort of chemical . tonic water . m- feels like a full mouthfeel at first but ends up feeling a little watery . probably because of the high carbonation in a watery liquid . d- i was really eager to drink this one but after my first glass , am not even eager to pour myself a second one . i 'm having a hard time with the weird bitterness . i love hops and their bitterness but this , i do n't quite understand .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	pour : draft to pint glass . medium reddish brown color with half an inch of white head that lasts a about a minute and half before leaving a very thin layer over the entire surface of the beer . the beer is served pretty warm , almost room temp . nose : smells very sweet - strongest aromas are citrusy , like oranges and grapefruits . i also get a good whiff of malts upon agitating the beer a bit . mouth : the beer enters sweet and cherry-y . a slight hoppy bitterness appears as the beer moves back in the mouth and swallows w/ a distinct lager-ish flavor and becomes a bit chalky . the temp of the beer seems to affect the carbonation , making it softer on the mouth , but i feel like this is responsible giving it the chalky and metallic swallow . also , for how smooth this beer feels in the mouth , the carbonation makes itself known once it 's in the stomach . overall , this is a pretty unremarkable beer . i would like to try it at a lower temperature to see if it came off with a more refreshing presentation .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.80	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . light hazy golden brown in color with a soapy head and some lace . smells of bready malt and some spicy hops . the taste grows on me particularly . at first , just strong hop bitters , but as i delve into it further , orange peel notes , grapefruit juices , light malt backing tries to peek through , then the hops squash it . mouthfeel is medium bodied . interesting attributes to this brew . spritzy and a bit spicey on the palate . drinkability is solid , this is a nice new yearly addition from sn .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.50	this helles was served on tap in a pint glass at the brewery . pours a cloudy straw color . there was a thin 1/4 inch head of white head . retention was poor as it faded quickly . there was only a small amount of lacing left behind . the aroma was almost non-existent . there was a faint hit of wheat and yeast . the taste of the helles bock , was light in body , slightly watery . mouthfeel was smooth . there was a slight taste of pale malt , yeast and wheat . not very flavorful , i had many helles bocks in germany and this is very much watered down in comparison . decent session beer i guess , was a little disappointed .

0.70 0.90 0.70 1.00 1.00	received in a trade . thanks again david ... poured from a bomber into a bruery snifter ... a - pours black with a one finger light brown head that dissipates at a fairly hasty pace . there is a little slippery lacing to be had ... s - smells like a chocolate milkshake with some dark fruits in the mix . very inviting scent as i am a big fan of chocolate heavy brews ... t - chocolate up front followed by some more chocolate , and some dark fruits in the finish . abv is very well hidden . chocolate is definitely the main focus here . some might call this one dimensional : i just call it delicious . not sure i would classify this as a quad , as it does n't have alot of quad characteristics , but it is damb tasty nontheless . m - a little thin . medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation . would have liked a more creamy mouthfeel , but this one is still extremely smooth and rich ... o - super tasty , but not something i would recommend if you are looking for a standard quad . definitely something i will be looking to obtaining again ... cheers ...

0.40 0.20 0.60 0.20 0.20	pours golden orange with plenty of spices floating around - almost no head and left no lacing smells like pizza - the sauce spice crust cheeze - its all there - but after a few sips the smell makes me want to vomit taste is much like the smell - this is liquid pizza - now as much as i love pizza .. i never want to have it beer form mouthfeel - light well carbonated - just average drinkability - awful - this is the beer that sceams never again

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.80	appearance : hazy orange without much head . smell : a bit of a yeasty smell with some toastiness and fruitiness . notes of honey as well . taste : a bit of tartness and yeast . some fruit ( apricots ? ) . some hops in the finish but not much . a little on the bland side . mouthfeel : very light . even a bit watery drinkability : goes down easy .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	a : pours a dark brown color . a one finger beige head forms and leaves some sticky lace . s : not very aromatic . some nondescript roasted malt . some lactic milk/cream . nothing else really . t : there is a little more flavor . some roasted malt , bitter chocolate , and sweet caramel . m/d : a light body that is thin and watery . very under carbonated . not hard to drink . i am having no problems finishing the bottle , but nothing i would want to drink again . this does not do it for me . just kind of bland . nothing bad , but there are much better stouts out there .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	poured from an undated pint bottle into a sam adams boston lager glass . vitus pours a beautiful cloudy bright gold that is topped by a massive two-and-a-half-fingers of bright white foam . the head is fluffy and retains amazingly well , slowly subsiding into an island crown . there is not much lacing , but weizen beers generally are n't known for that . the aroma hits the classic weizen yeast smell of bananas . i also detect a slight bubblegum aroma . the banana sensation show up in spades when i taste it , as well as something akin to wheat crackers . cloves take precedence over bubblegum on the tongue , which is curious since i did n't smell any . oh yeah : i do n't taste any alcohol either . as is always the case with a good weizen beer , they nailed the mouthfeel here . weizen beers are supposed to be fluffy , cute , and cuddly ; this is . ergo , they ca n't improve the mouthfeel any more . yummy , the best weizenbock i 've had to date .

0.80 0.60 0.20 0.60 0.50	pretty bottle . pours a large white head with fair retention and some lace . clear and amber colored . smells like butterscotch and nutmeg . nutmeg , and butterscotch primarily . some cinnamon and vanilla . captain morgan 's spiced rum taste with swallow . very dry though i think that 's just part of brittish brewing . dryness and cough syrup-like mouth coating creates little desire to have another . pretty wimpy for a winter warmer . maybe winter in florida .

0.40 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.70	appearance : the beer is a super hazy copper color with a head that dissipated insanely fast . the head is slightly off white , i think it really went away before i could even take note of it . if there is no head i am not happy . just horrible appearance overall . smell : lot of sweet malt with an almost honey like aroma with some fruitness as well . there is a pretty limited amount of hops in the aroma for me to even consider this an ipa . taste : the flavor is very malt dominant with not even enough bitterness to provide a semblance of balance . there is a tiny bit of citrus and grapefruit flavor i would associate with hops , but seriously where are the hops ? mouthfeel : the carbonation is well balanced with a nice medium body , leaning a bit on the heavier side . drinkability : the mouthfeel is great and there is no sign of the 7 % abv . it really could be enjoyable as long as i pretend i never read or heard that it was an ipa . the lack of hops really killed it and that could be due to it being an older bottle , but thanks to a lack of bottling date i guess i will never know .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90	$ 5 on tap at grumpys ? sounds good . poured into a mug : ( pours a super dark brown , with a small caramel head . smell is roasty with some good coffee undertones . not super aromatic . taste is outstanding . good coffee and chocolate and malt ( ate a small piece of oreo birthday cake with this and it was damn near orgasmic ) mouthfeel is surprisingly thin . i really expected more , and it did affect the taste a bit , a thicker richer mouthfeel would have really helped hold the flavors more . overall , really good ris . when they bottle this i 'll be buying some more . not quite on the level of a darkness , but a good local ris .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	i had at new old lompoc in early june this review is taken from my notes . this was brewed for the sasquatch brewfest . it appeared a copper like color with a thin white covering . smells of fruity hops : a little pineapple , a little berry and a little orange . there is also a slight bready malt smell noticeable to . the taste is composed mostly of hops , but the beer showcases many different flavor characteristics of hops . there is a nice tropical fruit flavor a nice citrus like flavor , a little pine like quality and of course a strong bitterness . malt is also in the picture adding a slight caramel taste in the background but it is hops that fully dominate this ale . the mouth feel was excellent and one could tell the cask was being maintained properly . the temp was perfect : around cellar temperature . carbonation was very low but did exist . though the ale was fairly heavy with both hops and malt i found it to be quite drinkable due to variety of flavors in the beer . a very good beer not sure if zach the brewer of this ale is going to brew it again but worth trying if you see it especially on cask .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90	thanks to clvand0 for sharing this one , enjoyed in a session with him , sheepnutz , and kmpitz . pours a deep copper , pumpkin pie-like color , with a quarter inch of off-white head that falls to a slight frosting . opaque , dirty and hazy , with some suspended sediment . little to no visibly active carbonation . the aroma gives me indications of apple cider and orange peel . the alcohol is also apparent in the nose . the flavor is sweet at first , then builds a bit of an orange and lemony sourness . light earthy malt , with just enough hop contribution for balance . a light- to moderate mouthfeel , hints of sour flavor linger at the back of the tongue after the swallow . i do n't pick up much of a hint of carbonation in the mouthfeel . not aggressive at all , it 's an easygoing brew that would be tasty sitting on the porch on a nice fall evening .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.60 0.70	i pour this out of my 22oz bomber , and realize that no head is developing . i pour aggressively , but a fizzy head disappears almost instantly . so , no head and therefore no lace . however , this is a firmly coffee-bean brown that does n't let much light through . it certainly looks like a coffee porter . it smells much of coffee than it does of porter , but i am fondly reminded of one of my favorite beers -- moe 's bender ( a limited surly release ) . bold and earthy coffee beans mix with hints of vanilla , and bitter dark chocolate . it 's like a french caf just fused with a belgian chocolatier house . this beer barely tastes more like a beer than it does a coffee drink . carrying barely any carbonation , it feels like a coffee drink . kona moon porter sure is a schizophrenic beer . the taste carries all of the notes of the smell : rich and dark coffee grounds , vanilla , and bitter chocolate . it 's hard to determine whether hops lend a bit of bitterness , or if the bitter coffee is confusing me . i 'll say it has a bit of a hop bitterness to it , though the beer seems to have a strange lack of malt . kona moon is fairly thin , and i ca n't distinctly pick out a malty taste . so -- is it delicious ? yes . is it a good coffee porter ? jury is still out on that one . certainly worth a try , but i 'd appreciate a little more porter to serve as a base , and a little less java .

0.90 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	big thanks to trodersark for this one ! bottled on 5/26/2011 and poured into a snifter . a- beautiful , hazy orange color with a pillow soft 1.5 finger head . looks like fluffy clouds outside the airplane window , and makes you want to jump right in ! s- sweet , sweet hops ! a nice bit of pine in there as well . i can tell im gon na like this one ! t- simple , yet complex . grapefruit , pine , and just a little bit of sweetness . not nearly as sweet as i expected from the smell . very nice caramel malt finish with a bittersweet ending on the tongue . the taste is good , but the finish is world class . m- lots of carbonation from start to end . crisp and incredibly refreshing . not `` sticky '' like a lot of dipas tend to be . o- i really enjoyed this beer and can now understand the hype . would love to have this again while sitting on the patio on a hot summer day .

1.00 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	enjoyed on-tap at lucky baldwins what a beer . never tried this edition before , but i bet its never been this smooth . looked fantastic in a chimay goblet . served at absolutely the right temp . the aroma had melded together so well it was hard to pick out each constituent , same with the taste . the only one that stuck out was the alcohol . expected in something of this strength , it just managed to poke its obnoxious head out from such a now-refined brew . as good as it was , it was tough to finish . very potent , and very good .

0.70 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.80	pours a very dark red , cloudy color , with a good amount of tan head that disappears fairly quickly . looks heavy . smells quite nice- floraly , citrusy , some chocolate notes , some spices . a bit of black pepper coming through . taste was kind of disappointing for me after the smell . i hate it when that happens- it looks good , smells good , and then does n't taste nearly as good . it 's a little sweet , a bit of spice in it , but ... overall , it 's kind of boring . bland , even . mouthfeel is awfully watery , though not completely distasteful . pretty drinkable just because there 's not much going on , so you can keep chugging them down if that 's your desire . overall ... a lot of hype , without a lot of delivery .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.50	drink by 11/05 , poured into a chalice . dr. pepper comes to mind . that cherry flavor you find in cherry colas , or those fake processed cherries that every icecream parlor carries . looks pretty good , like a cloudy pale ale and a white head ; laces the glass some . the smell introduces you to the dr. pepper similarities ... some malty sweetness can be found in there but it 's overpowered by cherry flavoring . the taste is even more so . the wheat chimes in a little bit in the flavor but mostly that dr. pepper impersonator thing comes through . i have n't had a cherry cola in a long time so this lights a nostalgia bulb for me . the mouthfeel on this one fluctuates but it has one of the worst finishes i can recall in a beer . the thin body and soda-like carbonation ( and some wheaty texture ) save this some , but the finish is just harsh . artificial flavor , sticks to the teeth , chewing on cardboard , something is wrong here finish to the mouthfeel . if you keep guzzling this down you can procrastinate experiencing the finish ( perhaps a beer bong candidate ) . nothing else is terrifically intense so otherwise this goes down pretty easily , but reaching for another bottle just doesnt seem like a good idea . if you like dr. pepper and chewing on cardboard , then this is the beer for you !

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	clear medium mahogany . fine off-white head settles to a thin , complete cap leaving a lot of lacing . nose is caramel , dried cherries , and raisins . some bready malt pokes through , as does some leafy hop . bit of earthiness adds complexity . medium full in the mouth with the bready malt and caramel dominating . plenty of fruitness , and enough hop bitterness to balance . touch of chalkiness helps to boost the hop , and its more controlled than in the ssb . finish is long and lingering with all of the palate components present . mouthfeel is a bit fizzy , and another beer where bottle-conditioning would have a positive impact . quite drinkable for what it is , and a very nice example of the style . best before date of february 3 , 2005 .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60	this followed ballast point sea monster stout . so i need to be considerate . a good character for the price . s average . t smokey , but no richness . it is a decent choice . m taste good , but thin . d will do . this beer i will try again sometime the ballast was so devine ! ! !

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80	the beer gave an aromatic , full smell . the smell wafts and builds on itself till you feel you may actually be drinking it ; but , the smell can have a sharp ting to it . the taste has a great start to it which delivers a bounce of classic fruitiness . following that , one gets a slight spike of bittersweetness and it almost works . after that , the taste quickly dissipates into a tartness mixed with carbonation . like the taste , the mouthfeel of the beer delivers a good thickness at the beginning , but quickly disappears to feel quite light and springy in one 's mouth . overall , would recommend this beer for a good wintertime joy .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	pours a fizzy light yellow with almost no head . i 'll admit that i read the label and saw that rice is listed as an ingredient before hops aroma : ... taste : ... rice , malty ... mouthfeel : not bad at all really . sharp , biting carbonation with a thin to medium body is pretty much what i expected drink : it did the job and washed down my pad tai

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	a- dark , cola appearance with a smooth , syrup-like pour and almost no head s- slight vanilla smell , but i had to strain to catch it , with coffee and i also thought i detected a nutty scent t- i could taste the vanilla , but it 's my favorite flavor of anything so that was easy for me , and i thought the coffee was strong like an expresso , but no nut flavors that i thought might be present m- very smooth which was surprising to me because i expected it to be way heavier . this was actually the most enjoyable part of the beer for me because of that d- this is almost like a dessert beer that went down easy but it would have to be a one to two limit . i had this on tap last night but it was my last beer of the night so i did n't really get to pay much attention to what i was drinking so i brought a bottle of it home to have today . was n't bad on tap ( as far as i remember ) but not much different . i had this at the brickyard in lewiston , new york but it 's not listed on the beer spy list . if you are ever in the buffalo-niagara falls-lewiston area , give this place a try . my best friend is the gm and the person who got me into good beer , as well as telling me about ba . he is building their beer selection and doing a pretty good job of it .

0.40 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.70	pale amber coloured , minimal head , very hazy to the point of being cloudy - almost like a hefeweiss - which was not a result of a careless pour or a recently disturbed bottle ; i think this may have been from the bottom of the fermenter . aroma is flowery . tastes strongly of hops but adequately balanced by malt ; not infected as i may have presumed by looking at it . a nice beer which ( at least in this instance ) just looks bad .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	22-oz bomber poured into pint glasses . a = dark reddish brown , dark but good clarity . small tan head that quickly dissipated , medium to heavy lacing . s = relatively nondescript smells of light yeast , maple syrup , toaste malts and bitter hops . t = wow , this stuff is sour ! the smell did not prepare me for this , but after tasting i do get a slight whiff similar to a flander 's red ale . there is a very sour , yeast flavor but also a creamy toasted malt backbone underlying it . the two flavors are not well blended however . i could see where some might really like this , but it is a little unbalanced in my opinion . m = medium bodied , good mouthcoating , frothy level of carbonation when swished . would be perfect if not for the pucker inducing sourness . d = slightly above average . this is an interesting beer and i can imagine having it again now that i know what i am in for , but it is not a typical brown ale , so as long as you know that , go for it .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.60	a : cloudy , orange , no head . s : really malty , not citrus , a bit of brown sugar . t : lots of english/scottish hops , very alcoholic , no fruit . barley is nice and strong . there are some mega hops in this . has a nice bitter aftertaste with a little sugar . very toasty malt . m : chewy , thick , medium-heavy body , good carbonation . rather astringent . this is great for the style . d : thickness and richness hinder drinkability . so does the alcohol content . definitely good on its own , but a little rich to drink with a meal .

1.00 0.40 0.30 0.30 0.30	chilled bomber into a glass . 2007 vintage , tried at the end of july 2009 . sent ( and recommended ) by uwftke26 . a : pours a cloudy amber body with orange tones against the light . has a fairly generous 2 inches of head with pretty good retention , taking between 5-10 minutes to collapse into a lighter cap on top of the brew before i can start drinking . thick scoops of lace down the sides from the head , and light register marks as i sip . s : lots of caramel malts with something of a nutty bent to them , and some barnyard notes ( infected ? ) . grapefruit and herbal hops next . i 'm surprised it 's still hoppy for something that is two years old . t : tilted slightly toward sweet caramel with nuts and molasses , with citrus hops making a play toward the latter half of the taste . it pulls to a resiny finish with a lingering bitterness . it 's not bad , but just kind of unimpressive . i really do n't think the hops held up well . m : medium bodied . fizzy carbonation , but not enough to clean the resin off , giving it a slightly oily feel . definitely boozy still , with some heat on exhalation . d : it was pretty interesting to try , but i could n't figure out how to respond to this beer . it 's not really a great iipa , and the malts are n't complex enough to make it a good barleywine ... just kind of a muted compromise between both . i 'm not sure what i was supposed to get out of this one .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50	a- pale golden with lots of carbonation , no head and poor lacing . not alot of appeal . s- watery and generic t- again watery and very carbonated . m- fairly smooth but the carbonation was more than i expected from it d- too weak for my taste . not worth it .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.70 0.80	this one poured a copper color and had a nice creamy head on it . the main thing that stood out with this beer was the aroma . it was very intense . flowery and fruity hop smell . the aftertaste was a little too bitter for me , but i enjoyed it regardless . i would order it again . 4/5/03 : sampled at the sly fox brew house in phoenixville , pa . this beer poured a golden color and had a thin white head . as i remembered the hops are the main accent with this beer . very intense citrus and flowery aroama . in your face . nice grainy body that went down easy .

0.70 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	a : pours a pale copper color with a creamy , one-finger head and lacing that clings . s : pine , citrus hops and caramel malt . t : exceptionally well-balanced between the bite of cascade hops and the sweetness of caramel malt . big notes of pine and grapefruit . crisp and clean . finishes slightly bitter . m : medium-bodied and moderately carbonated . d : an extremely sessionable ipa that may be too tame for the average hophead . an ideal ale to introduce someone to the style . happy anniversary !

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.60	at first pour , the beer comes out a deep brown with a tanish head which lasts but not overly long . as far as the taste went , roasted malts , with a little , very little amount of hops . one thing i did notice however was there was an almost chemical like taste , not overpowering by anymeans , but it was there so i took some off of taste for that . all in all however a good brew which i will buy again .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	feels like about 6 years since i 've had this style . maybe not that long , but i was due . and it looks a beaut . blacker than probably any other beer i 've had calling itself a wee heavy , the head is a washed-out tan , or dirtied white , and it does n't last long but my oh my , the color is promising . plum , fig , raisin , cherry pipe tobacco and alcohol mingle in the nose . probably a smidgen tame , for the bigness of the beer , and then with warming probably a smidgen alcohol-dominant . delicious . and i think what makes it delicious is not entirely a taste thing , but a feel thing . so smooth and creamy and round without any heaviness or stickiness . and it 's an appropriate textural delivery for the huge fruits here ( again , fig , plum and raisin dominant ) ; smoky cherry continues to remind of pipe tobacco ; a more general/generic smoke flavor nicely sneaks in with warming ; and there 's a milky chocolate essence entering into the flavor that i did n't detect in the smell . the only thing that keeps this from an even higher taste rating is the alcohol , which threatens to overwhelm everything else . it never totally does , but teeters a little too close . quite the treat , this has a burly attitude and is a definite slow sipper , but it never quite veers out of control . well-made , well-played . well worth a try .

0.90 0.50 0.50 0.70 0.60	brown 500ml bottle , 5.2 % and brewed in wansworth according to the neck label , best before 31st oct 2007 , drank on a cold and wet 14th june 2007 , it feels like winter . poured into a pint sleeve glass . rich ruby red , dark mahogany colour with a well formed off white head . very little aroma , malts and toast maybe . the taste is malty and bitter , with a burnt coffee/toffee feel to it . fairly dry in the mouthfeel and not much of an alcohol bite to it . i was expecting more from this beer , having in the past , drank it on cask .

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.40	came in a belgian variety pack my wife got me - 14.99 for six bottles . beautiful color , burnt sienna . standard belgianish yeasty smell , nothing special . taste is very acidic , very standard otherwise . very , very foamy in the mouth . not worth trying again .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.80	a-pours a transparent copper color with a nice foamy white head . heavy lacing . s- caramel malt with a hint of some citus/piney hops . t- a nice blend of the malt and the hops . the malt really just dominates but the hops are easily detected . alcohol is noticed but oh so slightly . m- medium/heavy bodied . d- can work a 6 pack no prob . overall- me being a hop head for an american ipa to have this much malt going on they did a damn good job of it . the piney/ slightly citrus hops do n't really dominate as most ipa 's but this one really just joins hands with the malt and either of the two are left alone . i would highly recommend to any ipa fan to try this and especialy ones who are n't yet into the hop explosion category .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	had on tap at the cock and bull . served in an imperial pint . a- pale yellow . pretty hazy . bright white head that settles to a hybrid of a cap and a solid ring . really not as murky as most wheat beers . s- the first time i 've actually smelled wheat in a wheat beer . small amounts of lemon and a few traces of clove . nice smelling beer . t- kind of a more low key version of the nose . the wheat is combining with a sweetness that i ca n't put a finger on . with out this mystery sweetness this would be a pretty bland beer . a slight alcohol taste on the finish . m- very light and very nice . smooth and light on the sip and a nicely timed carbonation bite on the swallow . this is the best aspect of this beer . overall an easy drinker that is only about 5 steps above bmc in my opinion . smell and flavors leave alot to be desired but the drinkability and feel are great for a hot summer day or when the reds have a come from behind victory on opening day .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.90	a : pours a a very pretty , clear , light amber-gold with a thick , creamy , white head that has very good retention and leaves a very nice sticky lace . english pub ale signiature tiny nitro bubbles . s : very slight hops and honey-sweet caramel malts t : smooth , buttery and rich - a nice honey-malt , slightly bready finish with a light touch of hoppy bitterness on the linger . m : full bodied and creamy , the slightest touch of carbonation and a smooth , somewhat watery finish . d : this is a great pub ale - in my opinion , much better than tetleys . it has more flavour and provides a more pleasing drinking experience - i love the touch of honey in this one . this stuff is sooo easy to drink - i think i could have ten ! hey it 's st. patricks day after all ... i will definitely buy this beer again .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.40 0.80	750ml bottle # 1183/1800 , poured into a couple large snifters . a- starts with a big head as far as bw 's go , dies down to a thin ring . reddish brown color , not much for lacing . s- caramel , brown sugar , raisins , alcohol and a very tiny amount of bourbon . all the smells are very faint though , actually not much smell at all . t- hmmm.. i may be tasting everything i smelled . but its hard to tell because the flavor is just as muted as the smell . m- light body , low carbonation and some warmth . d- goes down easy , very unoffensive and well-balanced . a little dissapointing overall but definatley not bad . just really plain and forgetable .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60	picked this bottle visiting my sister in illinois this weekend . really excited to try it . love me some dipa , love me some dreadnaught . pours out a slightly hazy golden color with a finger of white head . nice looking double ipa not much lacing . smell is a mix of floral and citrus hops . fresh cut grass , hints of lemon and grapefruit . taste is a surprising breadiness up front , good for balance . immediately i get a hint of cooked vegetable/dms that blends quickly with mostly grassy hops . a hint of citrus . dms detracts . great blance and mouthfeel moderate slightly over average carbonation really smooth going down . well done here . nice flavors mostly , but slight hint of dms infection lingers . glad i tried this beer , i think it would be a real stand out without the slight cooked vegetable flavor .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.90	batch 266 the beer pours black and completely opaque with a huge cocoa tan head that stays around very well and leaves a ton of lacing . the smell is layered , with chocolate , toffee , coffee , and a noticeable oakiness ( bourbon ? ) . the taste surprised me by having a much more bitter hop flavor than i picked up in the nose . still some nice cocoa and coffee , and the oak ( bourbon ? ) barrel taste comes through very well , and the finish lasts forever leaving a sour tinge right on the tongue . mouth is medium with great carbonation . not as thick or creamy as expected but very pleasant . overall i find this to be an exceptionally drinkable stout . highly recommended !

0.30 0.80 0.40 0.90 0.50	do n't you hate it when you have to start your review with , `` i hope i got a bad bottle '' ? i was going to not review the beer , but then i decided that it would n't be fair to the other breweries for me to not review it . i was really excited to open this unique bottle , but it opened with a nonexciting 'pfft . ' i poured it into a widemouth glass . it poured like iced tea . no carbonation whatsoever . completely different than the other reviews . the smell is fantastic , sweet , yummy alcohol , caramel , toffee and all that stuff . the taste is great , too . but no bubbles at all . my toungue is not happy . again , i hope i got a bad bottle . luckily the taste is good enough to warrant drinking the whole thing !

0.70 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.60	a bad imitation of a kolsch beer style ; is poor in general , rare style in my country , its taste has reminiscences of a kraeusened style . good for a sunny day . drink from the bottle , good for `` aguafra cheeses '' a region from the metro of my city , famous for its cheeses . 40 % recommended

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70	a clear copperish amber brew that produces a nice one finger head of off white slightly sticky foam . a decent retention and lacing on the glass . smell is faint sweet malt and a subtle vinous quality . taste is very sweet with alcohol and dinner rolls . a mild hop bitterness tries to cut the sugar train off but the train keeps rolling . a light banana accented tropical fruitiness as i swallow . the finish is hot and fusel with a drying quality . a sweet breadiness lingers in my mouth . mouthfeel is the best part . somewhat thick and chewy with a tingly carbonation that leads to a light creamy component . drinkability is pretty good considering the booziness . still , you are not gon na kill a bunch of these and one was fine for me . a good brew for holiday sipping by a fire and sharing family stories .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.60	thanks to whoneeds8 for this one . 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass . pours a dark brown with a pencil thin off white head leaving no retention . aromas of molasses and subtle holiday spices . sweet taste up front-caramel with some nuttiness and hints of spices . the spices are nicely balanced , never dominant . light carbonation and body , watered down consistency . average drinkability , the aromas and flavors are nice , but the feel ruins this one .

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	i totally agree with jason 's review . you 'd think that shelter pa -- & gt ; 60 minute ipa -- & gt ; 90 minute ipa would be a normal progression , but whereas i felt 60 minute had a pleasant , clean hop flavor and not much else , shelter pale ale echoes 90 minute 's ambition of big maltiness to go along with the hoppiness . unfortunately , shelter is more like 90 minute 's retarded pet than its brother , possessing a nice low-level hoppiness but burying it beneath gobs of diacetyl-marred toasty malt and mustiness . do not seek shelter .

0.80 0.40 0.30 0.70 0.80	a. a brown mahogany color to it , with plenty of action going on with the bubbles . the head was gone ten seconds after the pour and left almost no lacing . s. did n't have a very strong smell and it was almost an almondy aroma . t. first and foremost , i liked the taste . it was n't too sweet , it was just right . a for lack of a better term , `` brown '' taste to it . nutty and awesome . m. there were lots of bubbles going on in the mouth , very active . d. i will drink this beer again , it went down smooth , tasted good and was an overall awesome experience .

0.90 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.30	something is up ( wrong ) with the aroma and taste of this beer and i do n't know what it is . wonderful appearance . dark golden body . fluffy off-white head . a lot of belgian lace . grapefruit , mint and pepper in the aroma . but , also an odd smell kind of like salami . this must be some nasty phenol created by the yeast . it is ... not good . taste is oily , peppery , and spicy . a bad yeast flavor here and a lot of it . i usually love unibroue brews for that complex yeasty quality but for some reason this one tastes a little off . i dont know what the problem is . that lunchmeat aroma and now this bad oily yeasty taste make this beer almost undrinkable . what the hell is going on ? ? could this be a bad bottle ? i doubt it considering it 's called edition 2004 , we 're in 2005 , and it 's 10.5 abv .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.90 0.70	12 oz bottle a : looks all right , clear copperish color with a small head that dies fast . s : smells wonderful with floral hops galore . mmmm also some piney hops and a touch of alcohol t : a glorified ipa . does leave a sharp alcohol taste after which is really the only detraction . other than that it is very hoppy with a touch of toastiness ? toffee ? the malt is present too and it is not just a system overload of hops . m : to carbonated . a sharpness of carbonation hits you in conjunction with the alcohol . plus the 9 % really adds to an unpleasant syrupy mouthfeel . d : the high carbonation with the syrupy mouthfeel should have me slowly sipping the beverage . but nonetheless the amazing taste of hops and malts have me drinking it quite fast . dont think i would go for another one , but thats not the goal of this type of style now is it ? d : its strong , its heavy , but i still gave it a 3.5 because of

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	a : the head prevents itself like once white walls now yellowed by years of smoking . i assure you it more appetizing than that description leads one to believe . the body is a dark and hazy ruby-orange color . s : the nose is spicy and meets caramelized sugar . a strong whiff yields the notes bourbon and vanilla . t : a delightful kick to the teeth in the form of a boozy and malty beverage balanced with vanilla and spice before a pleasing hop bitterness comes in at the end and pleases one self for nearly a minute . m : perfect carbonation . just plain pleasing . d : goes down very easy for a wee heavy . if it was n't for the price i 'd be looking for it a lot more often .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	pours black with a very dark brown head . this beer has one of the darkest heads i have ever seen . scent of ripe fruit , blueberries , raspberries , apples , pears , chocolate , tobacco , molasses , maple syrup and alcohol . a fruity and complex scent with less alcohol that i expected . taste of rich chocolate , dry bitter earth , ripe fruit , blueberries , blackberries , pears , wood and alcohol . rich and fruity , not what i was expecting . the alcohol is noticeable , but is far from the boozy mess i was expecting . mouthfeel is heavy bodied and velvety smooth .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60	from my notes . this one has been readily available throughout my area ( southern ct ) since late summer . pours a completely transparent , straw yellow color , heavy carbonation , with a creamy crown . about one finger thick . malty , bready aroma . lots of straw , grass , and soap , some diacetyl . more sweet malts , a little sugary . quite heavy on the straw . extreme rush of carbonation on the tongue gives way to a crisp , lager taste . more straw on the tongue , a little tart , like lemons . hop bitterness defined in the finish , lingering , but a light bitterness . malty/bready , a bit syrupy even , with crisp-tasting water struggling in the background . overall , feels unbalanced , too much carbonation and a little too dull . easy to drink .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70	i tried this beer not knowing what to expect as i was not familiar with this company . the 1st bottle was opened and the smell was enticing my 1st thought was this is going to be good . and i was right . tasted good in my mouth and went down nice and smooth . i am looking forward to sampling more from this brewer

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	the pour was excellent , nice orange , copper color with a good half inch head . the head quickly dissapated to a light ring that stuck to the pint glass for the entire drink . the smell was very fruity with little or no malt overtones , a slight hint of spice . the taste was excellent , a quick hop bite with a sharp bite in the middle and a very smooth finish . no lingering hops in the mouth at the end . this is a very drinkable beer , i 'll get more of this and would love to find it in a nitro can or on tap .

0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.80	appearance - thick and black , strong tannish-brown head , very rocky . smell - very faint bitter malts with some chocolate tones . taste - malty and chocolaty , but the cocoa type . has some hop notes as well , with some spice notes , possibly ginger . mouthfeel - very thick , medium carbonation . goes well . drinkability - very smooth for being 10 % alc , though the overall body can limit it from being more than 1 at a time .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	on-tap at bangers & lace . served in a weizen-shaped taster glass . a - finger of foam settles to a thick collar but minimal lace . very dark brown body . s - roasted malts , dark chocolate , candi sugar , light belgian yeast presence , and a light amount of christmas spice - cinnamon , nutmeg , clove , and allspice . t - taste is heavy on dark chocolate , roasted malts , licorice , candi sugar , and lightly phenolic belgian yeast . christmas spices are far more present in the taste than in the aroma . finish is quite bitter , with heavy black licorice present . alcohol is quite well-hidden . m - creamy , full body , with lower carbonation , and well-hidden alcohol . sufficiently hefty for the style and abv . quite easy to drink . d - not my favorite type of beer , but pretty good at what it sets out to do . i think this will actually be quite good when barrel-aged , as the spices should fade out and be replaced by bourbon and barrel goodness . two turtle doves is still my favorite from the 'standard ' series .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	pours a hazy copper/amber in color with a huge layer of foamy , light-tan colored head . the nose is piney , citrusy , and hoppy . very nice flavor . this one tastes wonderfully hopped , citrusy with a nice bitterness and hints of grapefruit . i can sense a touch of maltiness in the background , but its quite covered by the heavy hop flavor . the mouthfeel is smooth and nicely done . excellent carbonation drinkability is good as well . i may be buying more of this again soon .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	a- a dark , copper colored body with a finger sized lasting lacy head and tons of visible carbonation bubbles racing to the top of the glass s- sweet fruits ... apples , pineapples , melon . a bit of alcohol and some spices . hops are nowhere in sight . t- very complex and spicy . lots of the above mentioned fruits . more than a hint of alcohol . a touch of pepper also . m- extremely smooth with the right amount of carbonation d- this one goes down too easily . very smooth and enjoyable . too bad its near impossible to get more of these . ill have to save my remaining bottles for special occasions . check this one out if its available to you .

1.00 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.70	bottle : poured a clear golden color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and good lacing . aroma consists of alcohol ester with some slightly cloying sweet malt . taste is also dominated by some sweet malt with some distinctive notes of alcohol . full body with great carbonation but alcohol is too apparent . definitely lacking subtleties that i would usually expect from a tripel and too cloying to be a regular beer for me .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	provided by my buddy `` ned '' . pours a beautiful clear amber with a firm , pillowy head . smell is clearly citrus with a hint of oak . great mouthfeel and is smooth on the palate with a hoppy bitterness that lasts forever . first appearance is that of an amber ale but the depth of flavor and richness in the middle is much more complex . the higher than average abv is hardly noticable and i finished my one and only sampling in record time .

0.60 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	bottle courtesy of a friend - thanks ! poured into a traditional american pint glass . appearance : a slightly hazy copper beer , sort of dull , with a fast-fading slightly off-white head that fades quickly , minimal to nonexistent lacing - runny , streaky , bubbly - pretty average . aroma : balanced but faint . a faint , brown sugary pumpkin note , lots of pale sweetness , a few faint toasted notes . taste : faint toasted malts , pretty mild overall , with a lot of husky grainy notes , a mild hop bitterness , no other real hop notes . spices are faint too - nutmeg maybe , but not much else . earthy . pumpkin is really only a faint aftertaste here , or the very faintest of background notes in this whole ordeal . not so hot . mouthfeel : way too big-bodied , way too carbonated , and way too uneven . way too thin , too . eh . oy , it gets worse as things progress . leaves a bit of a cloying film , too . drinkability : not hot . at all , really . lacking in most of the good spice notes , all of the good pumpkin notes , most of the good malt notes , too cloying , sticky , afterfeely ... not recommended .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.90	poured from a 16.9oz . bottle into a weizen glass . the beer pours a medium hazy gold , forming a massive three finger head . the aroma is mostly a strong banana smell . the taste is very much the same , consisting mostly of a strong fruity flavor . very tasty . the mouthfeel is the only lacking part of this brew . the mouthfeel is very thin for the style . a full flavor , but the finish is almost like water . this is a highly drinkable brew . great flavor and low abv . make for an incredibly sessionable beer . as far as hefeweizens , this is easily in my top five . highly recommended ! !

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	i am very disappointed with this beer to be honest . it is alright but not anywhere as good as i hoped . it has a sweet slightly berry smell . it has a corny taste with just a little bit of berry essence but much . it is a little bit sharp . i had to pour it hard to get the amount of head that got with some average lacing . the body is bronze amber . it has a smooth and medium mouthfeel . there is not much for carbonation at all .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.70	what a crazily unique animal this beer is . oz . for oz. , one of the most expensive beers i 've ever had . it was well worth it . once . pours an oddly hued dark brownish black . i expected obsidian . strange . surprisingly robust half an inch of head . smell is crazily boozy , with caramel , burnt molasses , booze and ... burnt marshamallows ? what is that ? interesting . taste is volatile . a canker sore in my mouth actually began to hurt . i am not kidding . my slightly chapped lips ; yeah , they started to throb . holy shit . how much barley did they put in this ? burnt malt , a shit-ton of molasses . like , seriously molasses . straight up . some chocolate and espresso notes , and a googelplex of booze . you know what : i really like this beer . it 's a shame it averages out to like 95 bucks a sixer around here . the mouthfeel was crazy . it does n't look that thick , but when it hits your mouth , you have to work to swallow . wow . insane !

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.80 0.70	no head to speak of atop a pitch black body . awesome smokey scents with rich strong chocolate on the back end of the nose . yummy . a little of that same smokey flavor sticks around but this is mostly a sweeter porter . there 's some nice coffee in the aftertaste as well . really thin mouthfeel , a bad thing for any beer , is really bad for a porter . slightly fizzy as well . the mouthfeel is bizarre when held up against the robust aromas/flavors . i might have another but i would n't go out of my way for it .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50	thanks to deliriumfest for this one . poured into a pint glass . appearance : surprisingly dark - cola colored , but light definitely makes it through . hints of reddish brown around the edges . a half-finger of white head that subsided almost immediately . decent lacing . smell : smells like a mix between a macro and cough medicine ... its a really , really odd smell . slightly fruity . very odd . taste : a slight chocolate/bitter bite right away , and some fruit sweetness ... and , well , not much else . it does n't taste much like it smells , which i think is a good thing ? but there 's really not much too this at all . quickly becomes overpowered by a fruit sweetness . i have no idea what is going on with this beer . becomes a little more balanced and more coffee flavors come through as it warms . mouthfeel : nicely carbonated , and nice and creamy . feels good on the tongue . drinkability : well ... i 'm not a fan . it just does n't taste like much of ... anything , and certainly not a beer . i 'm not really sure what new glarus was going for here ... but i just did n't get it . probably wo n't have again .

0.70 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	poured from 12oz into nonic pint . no bottle dating ... a- very dark carmelly brown color . pours a cm light khaki , head . sticky lacing . s- light citrus aroma , but followed closely by a very sweet caramel , nutty aroma . t/m- bitterness is much more pale ale-like ; though there is a lingering bitterness at back of throat that comes out of nowhere . hops are more earthy , woody , and slightly spicy . malt is more bready . taste is way different than the nose . very light and highly carbonated with an acetic finish . leaves the tongue with a weird feeling . o- this is ok. not anything to write home about , i 'm fairly surprised by high score actually . much more similar to a black pale ale .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80	drank from my duvel tulip a - pours a deep deep ebony colour with a creamy , tanned , two fingered head that retains well and laces the glass nicely . s - aromas are thick malt and some smoke , with a little dark chocolate . t - up front some nice dark flavours of chocolate and toffee . vanilla kicks in before a smokey finish . m - medium to full body with medium carbonation . o - a little overcatbonated but other than that its hard to fault .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	this is a beer of ( at least ) two faces . at the oregon brewers fest , this beer was a rich dark brown with the terrific chocolate nose , flavor , and smoothness that the name implies . my wife 's favorite by far and gone when we went back two days later . sooo ... . sprung for a bottle , and apparently a completely different beer . this one was really much more like a stout . the chocolate was very underplayed . most of the flavor imparted was roasty and bitter ( not bitter chocolate or hops , but caraffe malt , which was not bad , just not what was advertised ) . out of the bottle , this was black , very little effervesence . rather than being creamy , it was a little oily . again , very different , but a difference that came out well . watch out where you get this one , it will effect your experience . the bottled version is by no means bad , just not as advertised .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.70	a : a very clear golden amber with minimal head and lacing . s : notes of sulphur , more than notes actually , lots of sulphur . t : a little bitter and earthy at first , but once that is gone a very metallic taste is left in your mouth . m : crisp , clean , would call it refreshing if it tasted better . d : if the taste and aroma were better , then this would be very drinkable .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.50 0.70	appearance - very light golden in color , almost macro lager like . fluffy off-white head . smell - citrusy hops with a touch of a sweet malt in there . also a faint note of spice . taste - hoppy mixed with spicy . i was wondering what that spice in the nose was all about , and if i was making it up . it ends up mixing in an almost vinegar-like strange off taste . its rather light on the hops in the first place for an ipa , and the malt just mixes into weirdness . mouthfeel - a little lighter for an ipa , but the carbonation is nicely mellow . drinkability - other than the off-taste , this is not too bad of a brew . after a few sips , it starts to feel like a lager mixed with ipa , and ultimately ends up kind of `` meh . ''

0.80 0.50 1.00 0.90 0.80	a : aggressive pour gives a huge tan head . thick , sticky and soft looking enough to sleep upon . the color is jet black , motor oil looking . i 've got to add , i really like cavalry labels . they look great and i love that this brewery is vet owned and operated ! thank you for your service ! s : sweet raisin scent with a hint of bittersweet dark chocolate . the beginning smells a little like rubbing alcohol . t : a light tasting porter with a nice roasted front . it is followed by a subtle dried fruit ( raisins and dates ) along with a bit of dark chocolate . so light but so flavorful . m : one of the most silky smooth beers i have had in quite a while . i would love it on cask , although the low carbonation is nearly perfect . an outstanding uk style porter . easy as hell to drink and flavorful through and through . a winner in my book , although the aroma is lacking the taste and mouthfeel are pretty impressive . a repeat buy coming soon

0.60 0.90 0.90 0.70 0.70	12oz corked and caged bottle into a duvel tulip . a : deep reddish-brown body with lots of black sediment floating around ; one finger of coarse white foam that quickly recedesto a frothy ring and leaves minimal lacing . meh . s : pure , authentic raspberry aroma - just like the amazing raspberry-cream cheese pie at the norske nook in rice lake , wi . quite appetizing , but very single-minded and not at all beer-like . while i would like a bit more complexity , i ca n't describe this smell as anything other than enjoyable . t : very sweet and slightly tart raspberries , light yeast , and some faint oak . pretty good , but overly sweet for my taste . i expected more sourness from a `` 100 % spontaneously fermented ale . '' still , there 's nothing `` off '' about it all - just simple and sweet . m : fairly light , slightly sticky body with ample , soft carbonation . quite lively and refreshing . d : overly sweet to be really drinkable. , but still not at all bad . notes : i was excited to try this one , as it was the only non-sweetened fruit lambic at my local store , but it was a bit of a let-down : too heavy on the raspberries , nowhere near enough yeast and funk for a lambic . i do really love the smell , though . it kind of reminds me of what i remember the new glarus raspberry tart being like , only not as well integrated . it 's been a couple years since i had that , though , so i probably should n't talk . i wo n't be seeking this one out again , but i 'll keep it in mind when i get around to trying the cantillon lou pepe framboise - my hopes for that one remain high . cheers !

0.50 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.80	poured into my lost abbey tulip . head dissipated to nothing . no lacing . nice garnet red color though . aroma is slightly funky and sour with slight tart cherry . smells good . taste is good . never been a big fan of flanders reds but this one is n't as intrusive . slight malty sweetness with a touch of sourness and funk . mouthfeel is slightly malty and lower carb . overall an ok beer . do n't think i would try it again . i need to try the grand cru still

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.70	22 oz bottle poured into a sn snifter . best by august of 2011 a : pours a pretty clear , amber/honey/copper color . 1 finger bubbly , firm looking white head . leaves a good deal of lacing on the sides of the glass . s : sweet caramel and bready malt backed by citrusy , grapefruity , grassy and earthy hops undertones . there is a slight spicyness or pepperyness , most likely from the grassy/earthy hops , but maybe from the yeast . there is also a slight fruitiness that is from the ale yeast . more malty than hoppy , though the smell is not too powerful . t : has a really nice , grassy and earthy hops bite , the peppery and fruity notes are there , along with some citrus , floral and grapefruit as well . it fades away to leave a lingering caramel malty aftertaste , though the hops are still there . the taste is awesome m : medium bodied , perhaps a bit too heavy , with decent carbonation , not the best , but is good enough for an apa . perhaps a bit heavy , but still really drinkable nonetheless . o : overall this is a good pale ale , though its identity is a bit mixed . the smell is not very hoppy whereas the taste has a really nice bitterness , its kind of a mixed bag . its individual parts are good , but on a whole its not the best . pick some up , but do n't go expecting an a+

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	on draught served in a mug , the 5 barrel is dark gold with a slight chill haze and small white head that leaves medium lace . smell is sweet tangerine esters and a little off tang from the malt . is n't this supposed to be dry-hopped ? it 's the rotating tap so i doubt it 's that old , but who knows ? taste is very fruity , but like the nose , esters not hops . there 's also this sweet tang to the malt that is a little homebrewy that i 've noticed in quite a few co micros on this trip , maybe it 's something in the water , not the recipe ? either way , one i pick up on it , it 's difficult for me to ignore . aside from that , this is a pretty vanilla pale ale - i was expecting lots of hop character from the dry-hopping the tout , but there was n't any of distinction to be found here ... mf is crisp , medium bodied . drinkability is on the lower side for me because of that off-flavor and lack of any other interesting tastes . mouthfeel is drinkability is

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.80	i bought a 12 pack sampler of smuttynose products . the sampler came with 3 shoal 's pale ales , three ipas , three old brown dog ales , and 3 `` brewer 's choice '' beers . i assume `` brewer 's choice '' is much like `` cooks choice '' in the school cafeteria where you get whatever is left , but i will talk about how this brewer 's choice was much more enjoyable than cafeteria food in a later review . appearance : light amber/dark orange in color . i love the unique design of a lot of the smuttynose bottles , and shoal 's pale ale fits into that category . some head retention with moderate head retention smell : not a strong smelling beer . floral hops with a crisp scent . taste : could have been more balanced with a little more malt . hops predominate with a bitter taste , but not overpowering . mouthfeel : something minor seems off but i can not put my finger on it . maybe a fresher beer would solve the problem- the label on mine says best before april 2009 ( the month i drank the beer ) . not skunked at all , it just seems a little off for some reason . drinkability : solid pale ale . this is a unique pale ale . i like pale ales with a tad more balance with malt flavors , but this is a interesting pale ale . i would like to take a fresher shoal 's pale ale , perhaps one on draft .

0.70 0.90 0.90 0.70 0.70	interesting barleywine . pours with a ton of carbonation . it took the beer a little while to settle down ... the head eventually got rather small , the beer itself has the typical deep amber color of a barleywine . aroma is very nice , it 's sweet and somewhat like baked bread . the taste was a bit off to me , almost slightly sour , but has a lot of malt and some hop bitterness there , this might just need some time to sit . ( this is the 06 i am tasting . ) mouthfeel is big . i think this just needs some to time ...

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.70	gold and black can that talks about patience in creating the distinctive lagers of the past and other statements . not much for a head when poured , it quickly disappears . however , the aroma is attractive and the lager has a dark color compared to its other coors beers . my first taste of it was great , however it lacks in the balance of the malts , and has sort of a over roasted taste . altogether though , this beer in my opinion is the best of the coors brand and i would recommend for something new . not a everyday beer though .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	my lower than normal rating comes from the water-ed down taste of this ipa . on the broad ipa spectrum this beer is trying to be something it is not . the hop flavor may be apparent to a non-beer drinker but to ipa lovers , it leaves more to be desired . perhaps that is why it was created however the taste is lacking though the mouthfeel is comfortable unlike many ipas , likely due to its `` lighter '' taste .

0.60 0.60 0.60 0.20 0.20	wow , what a shocker . had this on tap at toronado and it was the first time i did not finish a beer there . a - a reddish , copper like pour w/ about a half an inch of foam . s - a very musty smell , i was expecting a more typical sour beer style smell akin to the rrbc beers , but was quite surprised that it smelled like a gym locker w/ fruits t - not good . like drinking sour grass , probably the best way to put it m - low carbonation , slightly astringent d - not very drinakble , i had to leave a third of it

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	batch 600 bottled 7-28-10 . poured into my maudite tulip glass . appearance - three soapy fingers present itself immediately . once it dissipates , it leaves a clumpy mound in the center . looks creamy and thick . the ale itself is very natural looking . golden yellow with hints of wheat as well . highly carbonated with no hints of yeast residue . very natural looking . a good looking saison . slightly cloudy and opaque . smell - hints of yeast are noticeable right away . definitely some hints of lemon grass and fig . slight spices and hops in the nose as well . a citrus-orange smell accompanies the belgian hints as well . complex . i took my time trying to get out all the different scents in this one . a slight milky smell as well . taste - spices attack my taste buds initially , and then become quite sour . the sourness is quick to fade into a smooth , natural tasting saison . the lemongrass and citrus notes from the smell are the most noticeable . the aftertaste is filled with sweet clove and yeast . i was a little underwhelmed by the intensity of the spices . mouthfeel / drinkability - very bitter and sour feeling in the mouth . a belgian-yeast-like tasting saison . very tart on the tongue . starts off medium bodied and then gets lighter as you swallow . very crisp and citrusy as it rests in your mouth . high carbonation that smooths out to a crisp and dry finish on the tongue . i was surprised that i enjoyed this beer as much as i did . i bought eight jolly pumpkin beers today ; and had this first because i expected it to be my least favorite . i think this will be slightly hard to top , however . it still does not compare to la roja as far as my personal taste ; but one of these is bound to top it . for the style , an excellent saison that reminds me why i love jolly pumpkin brews .

0.50 0.60 0.50 0.70 1.00	beer # 2 of 11 reviewed that were brought back from a trip by my in laws to china . a- looks like pretty much every other brew that i 've seen/consumed from the orient . straw like coloring , crystal clear and lots of carbonation rising to the top . the head was actually about an inch thick before settling fairly quick into a thin layer over the beer . thin lacing attempts to cling to the side of my glass before ever so slowly sliding back into the liquid ... not bad ; not bad though . s- the aromas are better than expected , being primarily of sweet malt and cooked vegetables . it is something that is different but i ca n't quite put my finger on it , but it is more fragrant than i would have expected , very husky/grainy but on a fresher scale . no hopped bitterness noticeable . overall not a bad aroma ... just slightly different , which is good for an asian lager . t- much like the aroma , the flavor is n't all that bad ! it has the aforementioned sweet malts and the uniqueness of this is that it has a sweet & tart grainyness to it ... .i took a quick break and found out that it 's made with a special `` ponlai '' rice which must give it the fragrant aroma/taste that i 'm experiencing ... an ever mild hop bitterness graces the finish . m- thin and watery , much like i expected from this style/area of the world . the rice malt gives this a unique finish that sticks to the palate like paste ... .otherwise it is clean and refreshing . d- this is one good asian adjunct lager and i agree that it is more like a euro pale than the adjunct character it 's labeled as . this actually has some flavor and is easy to down , and i 'd especially think this is true in hot humid weather . definitely give this a try if you come across it !

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	this is a beer from the 2008-09 winter bottling . a- pours a thick bodied stout with a slight thick brown head . similar to some other imperial style stouts . the carbonation waits until the end of the pour to raise the bubbles and head . s - a nice smell - not strong , soft mild malty smell - almost like chocolate . lives up to the name . taste - the taste is surprisingly mellow . lots of malty chewy goodness . no over the top burnt black patent flavor , which is a nice surprise . as the liquid warms the flavors evolve . there is a definite sweetness that rounds out the dark malt and roasted flavors . you ca n't really notice the hops , but they must be in there to add to the balance . initial sip has some alcohol hotness - however by the second sip the overall balance covers that up . the aftertaste may be the best part - leaves the taste of the malts in between your teeth and on your tongue . yummy . m - great mouthfeel as long as you like them chewy . really - i like beers of substance and this one has it . it is almost like dessert , but a fine one at that . thick but smooth like a well made mousse that slides down and coats you with velvet . d - ok so i started the with a 3.5 becuase it is so stong , but since the beer is now more than 50 % consumed it easy easy for me to drink . not that one should drink too many of these at 10 % abv ... but i think i could . this is a beer from the 2008-09 winter bottling . this may have added to its pleasantness since these types of beers take to maturation well . this is the second time i had this beer , and i liked it even more the second time around . great job bb !

0.80 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.70	pours very dark into a wine glass . head disappears quickly . smell is malty , raisins and sugars . strong and kicking in the nose . body is depressingly light . the first thing that hits you is a tartness , followed by weak malt notes and a lack of spice . very nonexistent in the finish . taking bigger an bigger sips just to capture some flavor . smooth , but light . bitterness in the aftertaste follows a big gulp . apple detected after intense scrutiny . not a bad beer , just disappointing for something so dark . flavor is there , just needs a magnifying glass .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.50	from the tap at the brewery . poured a deep copper red with little head . aroma malts , citrus , sugar , caramel , hops . flavor , citrus grapefruit , caramel , malts . watery mouthfeel . this is one that you could sit a drink all night.ilike this brewery but i wish the beer was a little bit more robust in the flavor .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	22 ounce bomber . high quality , a top notch beer . this is a very nice looking beer . it pours dark brown from the bottle and appears black in the glass . the head is dark , like any good imperial stout should be . however , any beer that doesnt pour like pure black oil from the bottle can not get top marks in the appearence score from me . i want every imperial stout to be pitch black , no matter what , sorry . aroma indicates that this is a fresher bottle , it has some nice malt elements ( chocolate , roast ) , but it is mainly dominated by huge , citrusy hops . flavor is very expressive and concentrated . it is massively flavorful in both malts and hops . the malt shows hints of chocolate , coffee and roast , while the massive hops add hints of citrus and pine . a very fresh , hoppy imperial stout . this is a tasty beer , but not sublime fresh . i could see this aging really well .

1.00 0.70 0.70 0.90 1.00	the appearance of this piece is , put simply , exceptional ! the deep red colour , coupled with the faint orange of the head gives the drinker a visual treat when one looks at the glass in which it is served . there is little to smell in this beer unless you stick your nose in the glass , but the smell you candetect is fanitly of apples , coupling with the colour to remind one of mulled cider . the taste , however , is a treat that keeps the apple overtones of the scent and adds hints of wood and hops . it is a light flavour that does not tire with repeated tastings . one of the biggest downfalls of this beer it the mouthfeel . like many ales it has a thin texture that does not cling well . however , it remains light and has a hint of carbonation that helps add interest to the beer when drunk . it has an interesting feel in the mouth . one can drink this ale all night . it is light and goes well with food in order to keep itself interesting . it is beer , hooray beer !

0.60 0.60 0.20 0.30 0.40	750 ml bottle into wine glass , bottled in 2008 . pours extremely hazy red orange color with a foamy 1 finger off white head with poor retention that reduces to almost nothing . aromas of strong raspberries , booze , and some tartness and big sweetness . the nose isnt particularly inviting , but is alright . taste of huge booze up front with some raspberries , malty sweetness , and some spiciness . lingering notes of sweetness and booze on the finish . big alcohol in the taste and a huge warming on the finish . this is pretty much undrinkable , way too much alcohol presence . big syrupy mouthfeel with light-medium carbonation . this was just not good at all , my first drain pour . i could not see myself finishing this bottle .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50	poured from a bomber into snifter glass a : light amber with a cream-colored head , very little lacing , a good looking beer . evidence of champagne yeast from the small bubbles . s : faint sweet fruit , not exactly grape , but not citrusy either . not picking up any hop aroma but there is a bit of boozy aroma . t : this was a tough one for me . first taste that hit was sweetness , can not tell if it 's from the malt or fruit , but this gives way to a tart bite , almost puckering . more tart than bitter , but this is to be expected from the description . a nice oak presence . m : a bit chewy for me albeit nicely carbonated . d : one and done for me , i managed to drink 12 ounces or so , but could n't finish the bomber .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80	05/10/11- review of a pint can stamped ( 11234 ) ? i have no idea what that means . a : hazy dark amber , solid two-finger cream head and some great lacing . s : copper , sweet , resinous , bananas and tangerines . welcoming . t : much more earthy and mellow and floral than expected . there is a slightly dry finish and not much of a linger besides the biter twang and some caramel . m : thicker , developing froth slowly turning to cream ... nice . o : pretty good and interesting . i 'd get the four pack again .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	cloudy lemon pour with a billowing white head . good retention and lace . strong wheat aroma with the expected banana and clove notes , though not as strong as most hefes . i 'm not sure if this bottle is past its prime , but its tastes a little tired . there are some very good banana and clove notes there , but there 's also a bit of mustiness , like a forgotten book in somebody 's attic . aside from that there 's a nice touch of sourness from the wheat and light apple notes in the background , but nothing that really wows me . the same can not be said of the body , however , which is spot on . perfect medium-light body and pillowy carbonation , but not enough to save a ho-hum hefe . ah well ...

0.60 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.60	batch 153 , brewed april 2008 ; sampled february 2009 a solid , but careful pour produces , three-fingers of pale tan colored froth in my 25cl tulip glass . the beer is an orange tinged , honey color that shows an incredible carbonation and an orange-gold color when held up to the light . the aroma is quite hop focused , but seems to have lots of sweet malt character that accentuates fruity hop aromatics . notes of candied orange-zest , concentrated tangelo , orange cream candies , essential citrus oil and a touch of herbal character are concentrated at the front of the aroma , while the back end adds notes of toasty , biscuit-like malt and some dusty grain notes . not as sweet as i was expecting , though this does have a light sweetness to it . flavors of alcohol tend to dry this beer out a bit and it has an ample carbonic bite to it as well . the citrus character that was so prominent in the aroma is not nearly as noticeable in the flavor ; this is lightly accented by notes of bergamot , a touch of lychee and some orange juice flavors . the bitterness is fairly soft for your typical double ipa , but does provide a lingering bitterness to this beer . the alcohol also accentuates a grassy , herbal hop character just a bit , with a bit of green , vegetal astringency in the finish . this vegetal note seems to grow as the beer warms up . the body of this brew is definitely on the light side for a 9 % abv beer , which is right in line with how i like my double ipas . the flavor is surprisingly un-hoppy considering the aroma of this beer , or perhaps it is better put that the hop character is the most dominant part of the flavor but it comes off as weak and flabby somehow . this is definitely one of those beers that did not live up to the promise of its aroma .

0.90 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.80	a : poured a beautiful translucent red . when held to the light i picked up tinges of pink and orange . the & lt ; 2 finger head was almost white with the faintest hint of pinkish red . the head dissipated quickly and left minimal lacing . i was really excited by the unique color . s : the aroma was not very full ... like trying to smell water . i labored at it and finally picked up some light hops and grains with some fleeting sweet malts and a hint of metal . t : eh . very light and watery with neutral hops & yeast flavor . the aftertaste was slightly metallic . i 'm not sure if this was a storage issue , but i bought it cold at the distributor and the fresh date was 3 months from now . m : is this even beer ? slightly high carbonation gave a fun tingle , but the low alcohol level made it feel more like watery champagne than beer . d : it 's certainly an easy drink , i suppose , especially if you do n't like beer ( i have met such people ! ) . it 's somewhere between a red pellegrino and coors light with food dye . it 's easy to drink quickly , but far too expensive ( for me ) to go through too fast . i was left trying to savor a beer i could not enjoy and had spent too much on . sorry magic hat , this was a big let down .

0.80 0.70 0.80 0.40 0.50	reviewed 7/17/2007 ( 19.25oz bottle , bb 30/11/07 ) : pours a golden brown color , fizzy , with a big white lasting foamy head . very strong ripe banana aroma , a little hops , but mostly bananas . banana malty taste , banana aftertaste . bottled water taste . not much else . interesting , but this will be my last .

0.80 0.90 0.90 0.70 0.70	12oz bottle , poured into a standard pint glass . a : ruby red to brown color , clear , slight tan head , no lacing s : big on the maltiness . has a little prune/plum aroma and a slight alcohol presence . no hop aroma noted . t : malty , rich , and sweet . has a toasted character , but no hop or fruity flavor is detected . has a sweet finish . mf : medium-full bodied , low carbonation , drinks pretty smooth and creamy . drinkability : decent brew . flavor did n't seem as bold as other winter bocks i 've tasted . enjoyable nonetheless .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70	appearance is a bright , translucent yellow with a light head and a bit of lacing . smell is powerful , but slightly stale : harvest wheat , mild hop crunchiness , and lemon zest sharpness . taste has a nice caramel maltyness with a fresh , crisp sweetness . a cloak of unappealing sourness is present throughout . mouthfeel is disconcerting , with a weak carbonation . somewhat creamy . overall , this is nowhere near as fun to drink as most oktoberfest beers . perhaps i have a stale bottle , but i bought it just a week after the real oktoberfest ended from a reputable dealer . this is labeled `` festbier , '' but it is n't much of a celebration to drink .

0.80 0.90 0.90 0.70 0.70	january 2009 bottle cloudy golden color with a large head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap . moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass . aroma is shared by pale malt with a slight sweetness , pale fruit such as pears , and the funky brett . everything seems to be in balanced and the brett is integrated nicely . the flavor falls a little short of the aroma . nothing really wowed me here . the sweetness was a little higher than anticipated . the yeast gives off little in either phenols or esters . the brett is evident but on the subdued end of the spectrum . just the slightest funkiness . i could compare it to a weaker flavored orval . maybe a good beer to introduce someone to brett . i have never been disapointed with the mouthfeel in any allagash beer , and this is no exception . feels light and lively without being harsh . very good texture . the beer could use just a little more heft in body . a good beer but not one i would buy again . i received this as part of a bif but i understand the price tag is high .

0.60 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.30	pours out black with no bubbles , thick & syrupy . smells of raisins , a hint of semi-sweet choc ? you can definitely smell the alcohol in this one . tasted it cold & warm : go cold w/ this one , the alcohol is very overpowering in this one . tastes of more raisins than anything else , except for the alcohol . mouthfeel is nice , thick , syrupy & smooth ... the way i want a barleywine . drinkability : struggled to finish the tiny bottle , need i say more ?

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.40	i was not going to buy a 6 pack of this , but when i saw this on tap at a bar with zero craft selections , i figured i may as well try it out as i had no good options to go with . pours a copper-amber colour with thin white head . ok head retention , minimal lacing . smells incredibly sweet , caramel and bready malt . i do n't pick up anything else in the flavour either , just sweetness . i had a little difficulty finishing off my pint , but it did n't taste bad . this is more just like a amber ale , and i think it is better than the keith 's red .

0.40 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	poured into a standard pint glass . appearance : did n't pour out as dark as i had hoped , and once in the glass it 's completely transparent . body is deep blackish-brown in the middle and reddish-orange around the edges . a small , tan , foamy , head formed immediately , but it dissipated to a thin halo just as quickly . no lacing . smell : espresso , caramel and burnt sugars , and sweet cream . possibly chocolate too . the espresso is strong , but not overpowering ; all of the components meld together nicely . taste : big-time cappuccino , cola , and heavy roasted malt . the flavor is roasty throughout , but it really kicks it up a notch in the finish : very bitter and very smoky . nice . mouthfeel : thick and full with a rich , long-lasting aftertaste . the carbonation is such that the beer feels very creamy , luscious even . in my mind , this is the perfect feel for an imperial stout . i ca n't find any flaws . drinkability : other than the appearance , this was a very good beer . share it with a friend or drink it on your own , but beware of the alcohol content - it 's hidden very well .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50	a - light orange brown in color . head is rocky and foamy and stays around for a long . no lacing on this beer at all . s - very fruity and sweet smell . though just single toned . apples , cherries maybe some clove spice . nothing complex . just up in your face fruit sweetness . t - taste is sweet and sour . green apples with a bit of cherry . finish is sour and dry . nothing special . m - medium bodied with good carbonation . d - not very drinkable . i shared the bottle with my brother . i wouldnt have been able to drink the whole thing

0.90 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60	appearance , was this beers strong suit , poured a nice amber , with a frothy meringue-like head , that left broken puffs all the way down the glass , smell was rather vague , sweet malty aroma , dried fruit perhaps , taste waspleasant , rather weak , unsweetened tea-like taste , very light , and slight hop dryness , but a nice beer on a warm day , as it is here right now , mouthfeel , is light bubbly , smooth . drinkability : is average , not bad , but not that great either , good session brew , because of the low abv , you could probably drink this till `` the cow 's come home '' ... .if you are so inclined .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.90	pours almost pitch black with a very small dark tan head that fades very quickly . smell of sweet cocoa powder , slight coffee , and bourbon . flavors of dark chocolate , sweet maltiness balanced by a roasted grain . the bourbon then comes on very powerfully , but its not just bourbon flavored , which i like . finishes with cocoa powder and vanilla and a strong alcohol burn . perfectly carbonated , with a thick chewy body and a strong alcohol burn . very good beer and the 13 % abv is hidden well . perfect dessert dinner . will age nicely .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	pours a deep dark black . black as night . opaque . thin tan head . looks like motor oil or tar . aromas of chocolate , whiskey , coffee , charred wood and a bit of hops . taste is chocolatey/coffee with some whiskey/alcohol characteristics . smooth , velvety mouthfeel . a bit oily . very nice alcohol warmth .

0.80 0.50 0.30 0.40 0.50	thanks to brian for kindly sending this my way from halifax . the bottle arrived in great shape , but sadly the contents seems to have fallen foul of picaroons sketchy quality control . decent pour with an aggressive off-white head that betrays the usual over-carbonation that i 've found with these guys . nice lacing as it gently drops to a steady cap atop the rusty copper body . nose is too skewed toward soapy notes for me to like it too much , but it does have a decent biscuit and caramel base . however , there 's something that just does n't jive with me . taste is passable , but by no means exciting , and again i feel something is amiss here . there 's a good dose of biscuit and some caramel sweetness , but also a slight acidic edge and a soapiness that detracts more as the beer is consumed . herbal notes are good , but the floral is dead , and tastes it . body is thin and viciously carbonated . another mediocre picaroons . drinkable , but why the hell would you bother . i 'm now prepared to right this brewery off - despite a few good reviews they 're pretty much crap and not worth the time or effort . if they fixed their quality control issues they 'd be better , but even then their beers are pretty bland and boring .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.40 0.60	this is a curious beer . it is oddly hoppy for a wheat , but this is the same impression i got from many of the flossmoor beers that i 've tried . it 's not cloudy enough to be a traditional hefe but its definitely not a kristalweisen . it was also a bit on the flat side and was n't spiced either . all in all it was pleasant but unremarkable beverage .

1.00 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	appearance & gt ; dark , midnight black with a beautiful chocolate malt-looking head.great lacing . smell & gt ; sweet molassess , dark chocolate , burnt toast . taste & gt ; good representative of a porter . balanced . not too complex . mouf & gt ; nice , nothing special drinkability & gt ; sure thing

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80	picked up a 500 ml bottle from the beer junction in west seattle the morning after the beer mail went out . poured into pint glass . pours a 1/4 '' off-white that stays around a while with moderate , frothy lacing . pours a champagne light gold with a lime tint . in the glass , gold with amber tint . smells of pears , peaches , and oddly : tomatoes - like a marinara vibe . citrus and herbal hop aroma . tastes of wonderfully done hops . more citrus than herbal or floral that sort of strikes and lingers on the taste buds , in a good way . taste overall sort of lays back . not near as abrasive as most ipas , but with all the flavor . bright , clean on-bringing ends with a nice , wet finish . very tasty . 8.0 alc./vol . hidden very well , seems almost nonexistent . do n't see what all the hoots and hollers are about , this being regarded as the best beer on the site , but i will say i thoroughly enjoy it and could drink pliny all day , the taste and `` mouthfeel '' never get old . **bottled on date : 08 18 11

0.90 0.70 0.90 0.50 0.50	poured into my new belgium goblet - from the 22 oz bomber during the nfc east game 2010 a generous almost 3 finger head deep red and very clear thick foam tastes a bit carmelly and has an amber tinge medium lacing at best s light on the nose - a bit of maltiness cut by an off-frutiness t heavy , great malty flavor , following the aroma : i get more of a fruitiness than a spiciness . sotra wrecks the great malty taste . m lots of carbonation , heavy body no alcohol bite d : for me i really cant get past the taste of slight fruitness . wont go back for another but i recognize this as a quality beer ( just one that i dont like ) next i 'll reach for a really great homebrew !

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.90	cloudy , unfiltered , yellow-orange coloured body , with a huge yellowish head of coarse-bubbled solid foam . looks extremely carbonated , with a huge froth of head and lots of streaming carbonation . lightly aromatic fruit notes on the nose , hints of guava and starfruit . it 's a tangy sweet-and-savoury character . hints of grain cut through as well , giving a nice bread character to it . it 's quite subdued , but quite pleasant . taste is pretty subdued as well , with a crisp but short hop bitterness and a grainy , organic character on the back palate . the more i drink it though , the more i feel it 's really nicely balanced . great mix of grainy malt and fragrant hops . mouthfeel is overcarbonated , though , leaving it too prickly and frothy . but overall , this is a very nice , if not extreme , pale ale . refreshing and clean , smooth and tasty . exceptionally drinkable .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60	a- light copper , minimal head , almost no lacing s- amber malts and nuts t- similar to aroma , amber ale with a nutty finish . m- light bodied . very easy drinkin . carbonation very low . o- ok to drink when no other craft beer is available . i ca see why this is a gateway craft beer .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	a- pours a dark auburn with hints of caramel coloring . has the massive head i 've come to expect from bear republic . s- sweet and piney smell . the hops come through huge . t- hits strong with piney hops.hints of citrus and spruce give it an excellent flavor . m- a bit thin for my taste . carbonated very well . d- very drinkable . the massive amount of hops and bitterness makes it one to sip of but i can drink this all night long .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.90 1.00	light yellow , slightly murky body with a nearly white head , about 4 fingers thick . smells citrusy mostly with some spice . very well-balanced and tasty . sweet , citrusy with some spice , but no flavor overpowers . virtually perfect . extremely drinkable . i 'm very impressed . the best witbier i 've tried , and a new favorite !

0.70 0.30 0.60 0.20 0.40	continuing on my self-punishment tour of some of the worst brews ever , i take myself to a true hobo classic ... the olde english tallboy . drank straight up out of the 24oz can . s : smells like old stale macro on first whiff . i am not exaggerating . you know the smell of old beer that has sat out overnight after a party and you have to clean it up the morning after ? that 's what this is like . slight sweetness , alcohol and metallic twang to bring it all together into one horrific package . t : kind of bitter , kind of sweet . a chore to swallow . not too heavy on the alcohol but somehow it still burns . consider it a perk , or part of the experience . lingers on the palate like a bad cigarette . overall : not something i 'll ever subject myself to again . there are way better means of getting trashed than this , and though it 's cheap , it 's not at all worth the gagging and self loathing .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50	a : poured into my trusty duvel tulip with a wallop of white head . rising out of the yellow pour with ice cream . resting atop for seemingly forever and lacing wonderfully . s : spicy , banana , floral . big smell . seems to be sort of a hefe base . t : the taste is pretty basic . easy drinking base of belgian yeasts and bananas . very sweet . fruity and full of ester elsewhere . maybe even a bit musty . the taste on the backend is n't great . mf : light , crisp , full of carbonation , very drinkable . o : just average . this was part of that 6 pack of belgian imports box . glad i tried it , but on to the next one .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	looks just about perfect for the style . glowing bronzed orange color , like a sunset , with a glaring white head that is creamy and remains present for the duration . leaves big splats of lace as it slowly chills out . aroma is finely balanced between sweet buttery/caramel-like malt and big herbal hops . malt actually reminds me of candied popcorn , like fiddle faddle or something . while the taste treads the high wire between hops attack and malt sweetness the same way the aroma does , the hops edge out the malt on the tongue . considering the style , they ought to . and those hops are big and resiny with equal nods to citrus rind and pine tree branch . a minty flavor reigns in the otherwise bitter and candy-sweet finish . without feeling heavy , this has both a creaminess and stickiness that works well to match the aggressive hop profile and carry the candy-like malt sweetness that rides along . bitter and resiny in a way that inseparably welds flavor to texture , and really helps define the beer . feel-wise , it 's magnificent . while my description of the taste sounds like the description of a big-ass double ipa , it manages to pack in a lot of flavor without going imperial . the sensible abv helps with that , and this is basically an all-around excellent , clearly california-fied version of the style . another fine brew from the typically hop-heavy moylans .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.60 0.70	pours a hazy golden red . plenty of fresh raspberry on the nose , and a little bit herbal . nice . a great mouthfeel , nice acidity and delicate , creamy bubbles . the taste is nice at the beginning . plenty of raspberry in a toned-down geuze like frame . the sour flavours are in check . my only problem comes at the finish , where i notice a bit of meat-like brettanomyces . too bad , because it takes away from what would otherwise be a nice , refreshing beer . it 's not so bad that i wo n't drink it , however !

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60	an exceptional weiss . very cloudy and very smooth without an overpowering flavor like the victory whirlwind . after having a few great weiss beers , this one trickled down the line to a decent example , but it is a very flavorful beer worth drinking . it has a monster amount of yeast , which finer weiss beers blend much better , but what can i say it is what it is .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	poured from 12oz bottle into a tall hefe glass . pours a beautifully cloudy , orange color with plenty of fluffy head . a solid amount of lacing remains on the glass after drinking . smells like wheat , yeast , and a little bit of banana . very smooth taste with malty sweetness , traditional wheat , a hint of banana , and mild hops , but i was really expecting more here . the aftertaste feels like it was watered down and leaves me longing for something more . this is far from being a bad hefe , but it 's clearly inferior to the offerings from style-leaders paulaner and augustiner imo . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation . best part of this beer . drinkability is high due to its relatively light taste and fabulous mouthfeel . i could see myself sessioning this brew . a good hefe all in all , but it does n't live up to the rave reviews here . paulaner 's hefe still reigns supreme as the best universally available weissbier .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	on nitro-tap at the yard house . paired it with the chocolate souffle and worked well - a real no-brainer . a - looked like a more viscous guinness . i was interested to see how the nitro-tap would work with an imperial stout , and i was n't disappointed . s - standard american imperial stout aroma . chocolate , coffee , vanilla , in equal proportions . t - bitter chocolate and coffee , provided excellent contrast to the sweetness of the chocolate souffle and vanilla ice cream . rich , very rich . a little hit of alcohol , nothing too substantial . f - all that i hoped it would be . very creamy . i 'm not a huge imperial stout guy , but i wish i could get more imperial stouts on nitro tap , i think this smooth feel helps the overall experience out tremendously . d - it 's so rich , one is enough . it also wanted to overpower my meal - it only really started to shine at dessert .

0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.80	750ml corked & caged bottle poured into a snifter . ( a ) - pours a clear reddish mahogany amber color that produced a great yellowish to tan colored head with great retention as well . some good lacing here and there too . ( s ) - dry ; very dry with some subtle pine and citrus . has a big woody backbone with some underlying caramel-like fig sweetness , but otherwise a very dry aroma . ( t ) - this has a great combo of flavors . a very dry woody pine that turns into a walnut-like nutty oak . some subtle lemon . has a really nice underlying fig-like toffee caramel malt background alot like the aroma had . a complex beer . ( m ) - this is ridiculously smooth despite its hop dryness and woody bite . that bigfoot-like background really meshes well with the big dry woody front . great carbonation level and balance . definitely does not feel like 9.2 % abv either . ( d ) - a delicious and complex beer that really hits the spot for me on this rainy night . i look forward to what a year of age will do to this , but it really hits a homerun fresh .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	dark red/burgundy pour . some reddish tints around the edges when held up to light . good 2 finger head , clumps a bit in the middle . smell of chocolate and berries ( cherry ? ) and tobacco . hints of hops are present to provide some pinch in the nose . tastes of coffee/chocolate , some cranberry and nut . is a bit thick at first , then thins out when hops are introduced and dries the sweetness nicely . the thick to thin feeling is accompanied by an overall velvety finish . i would like a crisper finish , but this is nice .

0.70 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.40	i usually like pyramid 's beers . this one was a drain-pour ... possibly just a bad bottle . a- pale , slightly hazy orange color with a slight white head . active carbonation s- bitter citrus hops . t- blech . did n't matter if it was cold & a bit warmer . strong bitter citrus & pine hops with a skunky finish m- medium bodies with active carbonation . d- drain pour . did n't enjoy this a bit . i did buy it as a single bottle at cost plus and it was about a month past its drink-by date of 03/24/08 .

0.60 0.60 1.00 0.70 0.90	on tap at laundry 101 in kent . not much in the mood for reviewing , so this will be a short one . appearence - looks like your traditional ipa . amber orange . laces to the glass nicely . a light froth on top . smell - hoppy and citrusy . taste - a fairly basic ipa , but it is definitely tasty . extremely well-balanced hops with a bit of lemon zest and citrus . mouthfeel and overall - very smooth and light-bodied . quite refreshing and reminds me more of a summer ipa .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	purchased at bauer wine and spirits in boston . poured into an ommegang glass . this is a very good douple ipa from avery . it pours an dark orangey color with a moderate head . it smells of piney and citrus hops with a slight , but not overbearing , alcohol presence . the taste is all hops , without being too much of a kick in the mouth , due to the nearly-hidden malt backbone . it has a wonderfully creamy mouthfeel that makes each sip a pleasure . overall a terrific offering from avery . this is suitable for both special occasions and regular drinking .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.80	new beer at our pub since early april . remarkably good . but pay attention : almost 10 % alcohol , but you hardly remark it . it does not have that much body , but it surely has a delicate taste . i 'm a bit more inclined for brown beers , but this one is really good , and not brown at all . nice glass , but nothing special .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	{ _ , .-~| on-tap @ nova brewfest |~-. , _ } a : pours red with a brown tinge and a beige head . mild lace on the glass with no lace in the head . crystal clear . s : grassy with a mild malt backbone and hints of pine nuts . a light red apple aroma . t : a good balance between the hops and malt with noticeable pine nut and grass hop flavors . fairy sour with a mild , dull sweetness and some fruity esters that taste like cherries and apples . m : pine lingers on the palate along with a doughy yeast taste that are both gone very quickly . moderate to light body , and is mildly watery . d : a good beer that 's malt characteristic is just below that of a brown ale . not as hoppy as most cali commons , but a nice example of the style .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	for it 's price this is great beer , much better than corona and on par with the more expensive victoria . with an amber color , tasteful flavor , clean body and darker finish than most mexican beers ( other than bohemia ) , indio is great option when deciding on beers in mexico . it 's quite unfortunate that it is not exported .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.60	bottle fermented , clear deep deep brown colour . thin beige foam . the smell is sourish with hints of gingerbread biscuits and half-and-half . in other words : swedish christmas . there is also a slight touch of burned malt and some coffee . the carbonation is almost extremely strong , but it is also fast descending leaving a surprised mouthfeel . the taste is fruity , spicy and somewhat sweet . there are notes of apples , nuts , cocoa and butter . the aftertaste is very complex with burned notes of almonds , peanuts , marzipan , brown sugar and is finished with a slowly growing sourish bitterness .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.80 1.00	sampled at the white horse in london , england . copper . the aroma was nice . english hops ; flowers , light lemon and herbs along with a slightly toasted maltiness . i really enjoyed this . this is a beer you can drink constantly thoughout the night but not only that , it is great as a palate cleanser when you are trying a lot of big beers as well . very good example of the style . flavors much like the aroma .

0.60 0.70 1.00 0.60 1.00	the interesting thing that some people forget about beer is that there are multiple communities of those drinking it . those who go for complex flavor , aroma , appearance , etc , who typically frown on american macro brews . then there are those who drink to get drunk , who look for lighter beers so that more can be drank in a single sitting , and though this is n't a cheap beer , at $ 9.99/12 it is n't overly expensive , and while the flavor is n't really complex at all , the extreme drinkability of the beer truly makes it a standout in the crowd who drink to get drunk . interestingly enough , i 'm the type of person who enjoys both facets of beer , so i can see the positive attributes on either side .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.70	poured into a shaker pint glass . a 1 inch head formed of tan with hints of orange & dissipated quite quickly . the beer is a deep red color , not brown but red with brown highlights . a bit hazy with good visible carbonation . lots of caramel sweetness in the aroma mixed with some dark fruits and a hint of alcohol . this smells like a stronger beer than it is -- odd that . no real hop aroma to speak of . sweetness and again a bit of alcohol in the first taste . also some lingering hop bitterness -- just to balance out the sweetness some . this beer drinks quite dry though . mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for a winter ale ( though not so much thin for a dubbel which this is described as ) . i really do n't get much belgian yeast character out of this as you 'd expect for a `` dubbel '' . slight astringency on the finish . enjoyable though not exceptional beer . a session winter ale ?

1.00 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.60	got this from a friend at a local beer store ... a : light gold color with a thick 2 inch white head that fades slowly . awesome look . s : smells of heavy grapefruit and hops upfront . slight honey and earthy scent in the middle with and candi sugars on the backend . very good . t : super bitter hops upfront . earthy light fruits and grapefruit in the middle with honey hidden on the backend . not much of a hop man personally . m : refreshing , but not as refreshing as most ipa 's . leaves a dry bitter flavor on your palate . not for me . d : get past the wall of hops and you can get this down . all in all , this is a fantastic brew if you want super hops . i 'm not a hop man myself . this is super dry and hoppy . if you want some malts and sweet flavors , than this is not your brew .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	thanks to buckeynation for this one . pours out pale straw and sits a cloudy orange cream in the glass with a good sized white head and nice lacings . smells of nice smooth and rich wheat with hints of lemon and dabs of spiciness underneath . interesting feel in the nose , kind of creamy . tastes initially wheaty with dominant malty presence . hints of fruit and punches of lemon float around . mild hop bitterness ensues along with a nearly acidic twang . finishes dry and lightly bitter . sharp and crisp in the mouth with buckets of tounge piercing carbonation . reminds me of a can of coke . swirling in the mouth means instant expansion of gasses and a near foaming from nose experience . not a bad witbier , though it could be toned down in the mouth and allowed some more leeway . flavor is not all bad , and is in fact farily refreshing .

0.60 0.20 0.20 0.40 0.40	pours a dark brown color with lighter edges . head was plentiful , and spongy . retention was short lived . i can see why they suggest drinking it ice cold and straight from the bottle ... this smells awful ! a mixture of metal , stale malts and a burnt rye toast aroma . the taste is better , but it 's nothing good . really , it 's just so bland its painful . there 's only the faintest hints of roasted malts and a hint of sweetness . this is like water . there 's no substance , nothing validating about the way it feels . i 'm so disappointed in this . regular guinness is n't spectacular , but it 's pleasant and drinkable despite it 's giant stature . this just sucked . smelled awful , tasted bland , and nothing pleasurable about drinking it .

0.70 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.40	pours a black with a small tan head that falls to a ring some sparse lace . aroma is some chocolate sprinkled on ripe fruits and spice . not really saison smelling per say unless just being little fruity and spicy makes it so . taste is well more saison like fruits are tart with light funk maybe but definite spice bite . finish is lingering roasted malt notes and lingering spice and tartness . little strange not sure what a dark saison should be like but this is pretty non exciting . mouthfeel is medium with good level of carbonation . overall blah not impressed with this one , maybe terrapin ca n't make a saison or maybe throwing dark malts in a good saison just makes it blahh who knows .

0.50 0.50 0.90 0.60 0.70	it poured a deep amber color , with a red hue . it had a one finger head . no carbonation was present . it had a sweet malt scent . it tasted malty and slightly sweet . there was a mild hop presence . it finished a little dry . it was lite-to-medium bodied . it is a drinkable beer .

0.60 0.20 0.60 0.20 0.20	it was a choice between this , a rolling rock and a bass . i chose the corona purely for scientific research . findings were consistent with those of the popular opinion - corn , and lots of it . corn in the aroma , corn in the taste . corn in the finish . now , i like corn , and i like beer . but i do not like this corn-in-beer , sam i am . redeeming qualities were the appearance and mouthful , both more substantial than expected . but when it comes right down to it , if beer looks good but does not taste good , well , then hang it on the wall and call it art . but do not expect me to allow it into my body . never again .

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	gold color , clear minimal white head nose is sour , grassy , cereal , melon , hopps , and detergent - taste of sour / bitter , grassy , hops , and wet hay dry harsh mouth feel for a light beer sour , cereal , and grass aftertaste nothing special for a pilsner

0.70 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	i 've got to applaud the very existence of anchor small for several reasons , that they dare to still produce something in so uncommercial a fashion , that they are still experimenting with ancient traditions . this , according to the neck label , is the lighter , weaker second running from the mash of old foghorn . hmm ! would they have similarities ? should they ? what are we talking about ? hey , i 've got an idea ! just drink it ! appearance : clear , bright amber color , large fluffy white head , that takes it 's time in settling down . aroma : mostly dry and clean , but many interesting minor notes make their presence known , hints of citrus , bread , sour dough . it 's more complex and intersting a melange the more i comsider it . taste : nice and hoppy , right upfront , and swift to mellow thereafter , though the complex citrusy flavor remains on the palate and begs one to consider it further . a coppery , citric tang rings throughout the finish , though it is short . light body , little malt , or hops , texture has n't too much to say . taste is too unique to neglect , though . do i like it , though ? i think not ... exactly . if it was n't only in these poorly distributed 220z bottles , and perhaps had a catchier name , and maybe a touch of sweetness , or a little extra flavor , they 'd have a decent , popular esb or something . but perhaps that is not the anchor way ... so be it .

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.70	poured from 12oz bottle into shaker pint . no b.o.d . aroma : big cabernet-like wine note right up front . smooth vanilla , powdered hot cocoa mix , very subtle metallic hint , roasted coffee , and earth . appearance : tan one-fingered head disappears relatively quickly . body of beer has a dark coffee color . flavor : smoky up front , dry dark chocolate , fruity red wine , with minimal bitterness . finish is notably short-lived . mouthfeel : medium carbonation . a bit on the thin side for an oatmeal stout . not quite enough body to be creamy . quite honestly a bit watery through the middle and finish . overall : not a bad tasting beer at all , but i wish they 'd bump up the gravity a bit . had this beer tasted like its aroma , it would have really knocked my socks off . the aroma profile was fantastic ! i just wish it had the body/texture of an oatmeal stout ...

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.60	a- clear gold with a light green tint , wispy head . s- crisp tart apples with some very light ethanol notes . t- sweet apple up front . tarness takes over quickly and dominates throughout . m- clean and crisp . d- the tartness is the only obstacle here . great for what it is . overall just not my thing .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	22 ounce bottle . pours clear amber color with a 2 finger off white head with amazing retention that reduces to a lacing cap that leaves very nice lacing . aromas of citrus , pine , with some fruits and spices . taste of strong citrus and spices with pine , that finishes with a very big citrus bitterness that lasts with some spiciness . very big hop presence in this over the malts . alcohol presence is minimal except for a slight warming after the finish . medium carbonation and body . as always i am a fan of hops , so this is some tasty stuff . more lagunitas awesomeness here

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 1.00	slammin ' some ho 's . ahh , that never gets old ! interesting beer , it pours white with a good amount of head as the bottle tells you to pour 2/3rd 's , swirl , and then pour the rest . theres a lil ' bit of something floating around in here ... yeast ? the smell is quite pleasant , like a mellow version of franziskaner i 'd say . the taste is like the forementioned , and i could pound these all night if it was going to be one of `` those nights '' because its just a great beer to session with . not very filling , light , and has the hefe feel to it , which i love btw . the mouthfeel is light , but hey , its a light beer ! for drinkability , again , one of the beers that could probably never offend me . good job . this is what a light beer should be ! a bit pricey though ...

1.00 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.60	this is a great beer . it just looks awesome with the cascading effect of the head . the head just last the entire glass . tonight mine was served with a four leaved cloved drawn on the head that stayed there till the end . the smell was very roasty with coffe and burnt caramel smells . the taste was the same . mouthfeel was great , it was very rich and smooth with little carbonation but it fit the stout just right . this was n't very drinkable . i could substitute this with my meal because it is so thick .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.50	tried this one at my buddy 's house . took it down from the can . not too much comes through on the nose , not to me anyway . taste was better than expected . definitely not great though . kind of bland . went down easy . i probably would n't buy it , but if that 's all that 's available , it 's ok .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	purchased single bottle from charles st. liquors appearance = cloudy orange-brown , not much head , decent lacing . smell = great pine and citrus hops , similar to what you 'd find in a good ipa . can definitely detect a bit of sugary malt too . taste = pretty darn good . nicely balanced with dominating bitter hops presence but enough sugar to come in and cancel it out so it does n't overwhelm your tastebuds . exceptional silky mouthfeel . i almost like the way it hits my mouth more than the actual taste . overall = definitely recommended if you happen to see it at your store . i would n't necessarily go and seek it out as it 's not that unique and you can find several other high quality beers of similar nature . still this one is right up with the best .

0.50 0.50 0.50 0.80 0.90	this is listed here as an esb , while the label calls it an amber . keep that in mind as we go along . batch # 066 ( or maybe 006 , the numbers were rubbed blurry ) , with a best by date of 8/8/09 , so i 'm having this slightly past the brewers preference . poured into straight pint glass . poured a very cloudy yellow-brown amber color with a 1/2 inch of slightly off-white head consisiting of very coarse , loose bubbles . actually , if i had n't noticed that head was n't forming and started to pour more aggressively , there may not have been any head at all . what head there was did leave attractive sheets of lacing . the beer had a very neutral aroma , nothing really jumped out me . the flavors therefore came as a huge surprise . a strong smoke flavor hit the tongue without warning . a well balanced malt profile carried the peaty flavors across the tongue . the body was thin , whether you call this an amber or an esb . the drinkability was very good , the flavors are intriguing enough to keep you interested , while the mellow abv will keep you sane . overall , i think this more of an amber but , regardless of style a tasty and interesting brew . i do n't think the extra couple weeks past the best-by date either helped or hurt tis beer , but longer term would n't be beneficial , check your label . worth seeking out .

0.80 1.00 0.60 0.90 0.80	what better way to celebrate black friday then with a black chocolate stout ! bottle courtasy of finnman , thank you . this is a winter 07 bottle , i have an 06 ' bottle that i 'll be hanging onto for a few more years . poured from the 12oz brown bottle into an oversized snifter . served at 45 degrees . dark brown 2 inch head sits atop the beer . black in color with no light penetration . sticky long streaking clumps of lace drapeing my glass . retention is grand with a nice quarter inch layer and assorted bubbles . aroma is of chocolate grains , liquid chocolate extract , molasses , dark roasted coffee beans , chocolate cake batter with an eggy white flour aroma . some alcahol notes at the nose . absolutly perfect in the aroma department . smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a slick inky texture . some carbonation up front , quickly melting away to smoother softer texture . molasses in the flavor mix , with hints of brown sugar , roasted coffee , its sweet at first . becoming bitter with chocolate flavors and notes of lingering bitter grassy hops . alcahol warming throughout , not at all boozy , just a warming sensation . this is definatly a sipper and not at all a sessionable brew . its thick , heavy and filling . two of these would take me to drunk town in no time . its an exceptional brew and a perfect example of a chocolate ris . mouthfeel is not as thick and creamy as others i 've had and there is a bit more carbonation up front then i 'd hope for . aside from these things it is a terrific beer .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	had this with a friend who happens to be named sam smith on a hot sf indian summer day ... . appearance & gt ; clear , lively . lovely golden honey color , big head dissipates quickly . no lacing . smell & gt ; sweet grass , fruit esters . mmmm taste & gt ; medium complexity . good representative of its style . sweet with burnt finish . slightly metallic hang , but nothing to cry over . mouf & gt ; nice . very nice . drinkability & gt ; decent , but probably not feasible for my budget

0.30 0.50 0.70 0.50 0.70	low score for me . i had this at the imperial bar in bourke st and there was something deeply wrong with my pilsner . i ordered one and my mates ordered their beers . when they were served up , everyone took their beer and i waited for mine , the bar girl said `` that one 's your 's , love . '' i looked to where she pointed and there was n't a pilsner in sight , when i mentioned this she nodded her head and said `` that 's the pilsner . '' it took me a second to realise that an almost dark amber coloured beer was what she 'd poured from the tap . what the hell 's going on here ? ! it looks like this pilsner has been hit with a few bags of malt . this was no clear golden beer , it looked like an ale . smelled like it used to be a pilsner , fruity , but malty . tasted like some citrus fruits but that malt kept creeping back in , not leaving this poor pilsner alone . good beer in it 's own right , but most certainly not a pilsner .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.70 0.90	batch416 a-very pale straw , about as white as a beer can get . cloudy . huge cloud like head . s-musty straw . lots of brett . some orange . no hops . t-very tart and dry . not flabby like many wit beers . a hair less sour would be nice , but this is still tasty . m-bone dry . moderate high carbonation . tart . perfect . d-great for a hot day like today . very dry and tart . a bit less funk might make this perfect .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	the pour is a deep amber with a whispy white head . aroma is a bit of caramel malt and some very light herbal notes . very subdued in both aroma and flavor . flavor begins slightly sweet with light caramel and bread notes , then finishes with a touch of herbal bitterness . light to medium bodied , with a very smooth mouthfeel . all in all , this beer is very average ... nothing special , but nothing offensive .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90	man i love this beer ! c - clear , pale gold a - smooth , smooth hops - you know it has a strong hop aroma if i can smell it . t - great hop smack . perfect blend of bitterness to aromas ( as expected from the amount of dry hopping they do ) . m - good solid carbonation . i picked this up at the brewery and it was bottled three days ago ! perfect drinkability and solid head retention on this one .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	tap @ o'brien 's . pours black with red highlights . no head . aroma of chocolate , vanilla , wood , and earth . flat mouthfeel . more wood and earth in the flavor , but a very nice malt backbone , carob , and some smoke make this very pleasant . definitely a sipper .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.50	pours a clear gold colored lager with a short lasting white head , nice gold color though . smell is very sweet and malty with a fairly good herbal hop aroma . does n't smell bad at all but it does smell too sweet . taste is a bit sweet with a fair fruity flavor from the yeast . a bit of toffee candy in the malt here but it is too sweet for the style . hops do n't really contribute much to the flavor , probably masked by the malt . mouthfeel is thin . an ok lawnmower class beer here but not something to seek out .

0.80 0.50 0.50 0.70 0.80	a= a dark golden color with a huge head . this bottle gushed all over the place on me . s= decent but not a great nose . coffee and chocolate dominate . t= watery with some coffee flavors in it . a lot more water than i expected . m= watery . maybe this one gushed out all of its carbonation . d= average . this is a good intro to belgians i think . its not over powering with the complex flavors but its still got the asic taste . very nice .

0.70 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	it pours with little head . the smell is smoky raisins . i usually hold the yeast in the bottle and drink it separately . this one was surprisingly thin in body . i bought it fresh and it 's been years since i opened one . the taste is great . the smell is an accurate forecast . the surprise is in the after-sweetness . after all these years it 's very well blended . i am lucky to have more . i wo n't be dallying though . i think this is moving just past it 's prime .

0.50 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70	750ml bottle thanks to nicks6217 , poured into a lost abbey tulip . poured an amber red , mostly foam ( 75 % foam , 25 % liquid at best ) and this foam certainly gripped the glass and always stayed above a layer of film . smell was largely of candied hops , very sweet smelling and only briefly did any oak make its presence known . a little one dimensional , but a good sign of things to come . expected vanilla from the oak , but that did n't happen for me . taste was the one dimensional candied hop from the nose hitting the tastebuds . it was n't something that beated you into submission , more something that was always there , and not in a bad way . i was a big fan of the mouthfeel , it managed to parch the mouth , presumably from the oak , while leaving you ready to come back for another sip . not what i expected , but overall , it is an ok beer for a tasting or a session . drinkability was very good , taste was sweet and one dimensional .

0.60 0.60 0.30 0.60 0.60	i have become a big fan of highlands cold mountain and rush out to purchase it with each years release in nov . i must say that this years is the most disappointing of the bunch . not as spicy or complex as in years past . the mouthfeel is much lighter . and the beer just taste overall watered down . i 'm glad i tried this on-tap before buying the big bottle . i 'll will push this one to the side as cold mountain at least for this year has become a meer average winter warmer and will look forward to next years version .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70	way too sweet -- even for a doppelbock . pours a deep , dark brown with some red tinge . essentially flat . nose is molasses and licorice . flavor is very sweet . malts come across as if i am licking different types of sugar bowls . i got hints of brown sugar , granulated sugar , and fine sugar . also , more of the licorice and molasses , as well as cherries and figs . mouthfeel is full , and the alcohol is not particularly noticeable , but more of a slow burn than a biting tang . slight dry finish .

0.90 0.90 0.70 1.00 0.90	2011 , poured from a bottle into a snifter . a - pours a dark ruby brown with a little clarity through the top when looking up at it . thin cream head disapated rather quickly . s - could smell this one right as i opened it . as soon as the bottle depressurized , i smelled bourbon and caramel . as poured into the glass , get notes of toffee , dark fruits , roasted malts , aroma of good bourbon , and can almost smell the booze knowing this will be a big beer . t - this is delcious . the bourbon brings a heat to the taste that lingers throughout , but balanced with some dark fruits , smidge of vanilla , toffee , oak , cherry . has some sweetness in the front to balance out the hot bourbon and booze taste which seems to last long enough to let that initial bourbon kick die away . i really like how the tastes play with each other , very complex taste and ever changing with the drink getting warmer . bourbon becomes more pronounced as it warms , making a more bold but welcomed taste after the introduction the colder flavors gave . i stand by my first sentence . m - little hot and heavy from the bourbon . but i did n't expect this to be light . the cheeks become nice and saturated with the bourbon , a great feeling when drinking a beer that is aged in good bourbon . but as far as drinkability , this becomes a little more of a sipper once it warms up . o - this to me is an amazing barleywine . great job of kicking the tastes up to extreme levels yet keeping the body restrained a bit to account for the barleywine . this beer is coming in a little hot right now , and should be amazing with about 1-2 years on this , but i for one welcome that bourbon . love the lingering taste and complexity .

0.80 0.90 0.90 0.70 0.70	a- black opaque pour with thin tan head that dissipates quickly . when held to the light , you can see it 's dark ruby red hue . s- lots going on here . smells like an oatmeal raisin cookie . hints of toffee and and lots of sweetness from the grains . not the way i remember this beer , either my palate is more refined or this batch is much different than from two years before . t- the oatmeal raisin taste is the first thing i take , much like the aroma . lots of grainy sweetness and not a whole lot of roasty backbone to follow it up ( as i would expect from a stout ) . almost has a lacto sweetness going on . very interesting , and again , not anything like the last bottle i remember having . m- this beer exceed in this category . a nice velvety and smooth mouthfeel that makes the heavy body much nicer going down . d- to me , this was very different than what i normally get in an oatmeal stout . it seems very rich and decadent , moreof a dessert beer . i would have loved more roasty coffee notes in the finish , but did n't really detect them . overall a solid beer that is somewhat unique .

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.90 0.80	22oz bottle poured into a cognac glass . it was clear and light pale gold in color . medium carbonation and a surprisingly thick off-white head . floral and hop notes in the aroma . dry start , then a delicious , but not overpowering hoppy bitterness and unpolluted floral and hop finish .

0.50 0.40 0.40 0.60 0.80	a friend of mine received a few bottles of 333 from a guy he knows who traveled to asia . the beer is a typical macro lager . it pours a clear pale yellow color with a fizzy white head on top . the fizz dissolves quickly leaving a couple spots of lace on the glass . a mild aroma of rice and honey greets you before your first sip . the beer was thin bodied and very easy to drink . its flavor had some notes of honey , corn and rice . nothing offensive . for a faint tasting , macro lager it was n't too bad . it tasted all natural to me and did n't leave behind any strange after tastes .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.70	had a bottle of this on 11-23-2007 . the pour was kind of boring , it had no head at all anymore . the color of the beer was a copperish red color . the smell of the beer was a bit malty and earthy with some hints of spice . the taste was muted pretty well i think because it just tasted like watery malts and some old spices . the mouthfeel was flat leaving a watery feel in the mouth . overall i 'm pissed i did n't get to try this years ago before 2005 it seems when everyone thought it was great . i feel the bottle i was stuck with had gone well beyond it 's life span and sadly i can not give this a good review because of it .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	a vintage bottle review 7oz . nip - '' bottle in 2000 '' lithographed on the glass . gifted from either sebbie or jackson - i know they both gave me a bottle of this years ago - just not sure which one this is . so ... 10 years seemed like an appropriate age time for this now extinct beer . and at 7oz . - not really worth sharing . and in hope that this will have morphed into something special , i want to sample this on its own rather than amidst a half dozen other aged or rare beers as always happens . fuck ya 's all ! i 'm drinkin it myself . a faint `` pfft '' is heard as i uncapped the twist off cap with an opener- this is encouraging - dont always hear that on these old rogue 's . it pours flat into the ola dubh snifter- some soapy bubbles on top of the caramel brown liquid . the thin froth fades quickly - absolutely no carbonation is present . aromas of cooked brown sugar and maple and higher alcohols flood the nose along with some stale pasty oxidation notes . the oxidation smells blow off but a pasty flavor persists in the beer 's flavor tho not overwhelmingly . what is surprisingly lost in this beer compared with earlier tasting is it 's body . the rich aromas used to be followed by medium - heavy almost syrupy scotch ale flavors , but this example is almost thin as if it has attenuated over the last 10 years in the bottle to a terminal gravity near water . not disappointing really tho not stellar by any means , this held up reasonably well considering it is only 7 % . but the rich fullness and toffee sweetness has mellowed considerably with time and it drinks much like a flat 60 shilling rather than an 80 shilling as it used to to my taste . still - these guys have been making `` extreme beers `` ( hate that term ) while the guys in delaware and san diego etc . were still home brewing .

0.80 0.30 0.80 0.20 0.30	22 oz bottle into a mug . poured a pretty nice , amber color , good amount of head with fairly nice lacing as the beer went . unfortunately , that was all the nice got on this one . nose was bitter and sour , biting at the nose , almost acrid . nothing like any dipa i 'd had before . extremely bitter , but not in a standard 'beer ' way . tasted like solvent , very astringent . my mom commented that it had the taste of fertilizer . truly an unique and awful flavor . feel was fairly solid for a dipa , but not anything noteworthy , and certainly nothing that could overcome the taste/smell . overall , ca n't recommend this one . i 've never had anything like it before , and i hope to never have anything like it again . overall , it 's a mess . nasty taste and smell , definitely something i will avoid in the future . may have turned me off for the brewer overall .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	this was bought on a whim by the bar tender at my local spot ( good call wes ) . i was intrigued by the bottle , as was everyone around me . color was a nice gold , with a small , quickly disappearing head with decent lacing . smell was sweet , with a citrus hint and strong english ale smell . initial taste was interesting , and i was n't sure about whether i would like it . after a few more tastes though , i warmed up to it . by the end of the bottle , it had become one of the best beers i 've tasted . i would n't recommend it for any parties , but in small groups of like minded people i would say good call . very drinkable beer . looking forward to trying more from the brewery ( if i can find it )

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	pours like any raspberry beer worth anything should . foam has a tinge of pink , body looks like dark red-brown raspberry preserves . in fact it 's opaque . smells , unsurprisingly , like raspberry preserves . tasty . good mix of sweet raspberry , minor bitterness , and natural-tasting fruit tart . my only real knock is the mouthfeel , it seems sticky and a bit too cloying , like there 's something in the back of my throat i ca n't dislodge . it is also very burpy . other than that , this is a nice fruit beer . i think the sam smith line of sweetened fruit beers does a better job with these dessert beers than does lindemans . if i need a sweetened fruit beer , i 'll reach for this or the cherry any day .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.50	looks great . smells pretty good . tastes uh , chalky and soury . not much of a scotch ale . maybe like a scotch ale/bruin de flanders sour ... yergggh . sorry . not the best review . just had after something remarkable . but still ... it is not good at all . chocolate up front , sour cherry mid , dry , sour finish . end of story . glad i got in a trade . probably would not buy for any reason .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter . shared with a friend that just moved back into town . hell yeah . poured a solid super deep brown/black . small head with tiny splotches of lace . chocolate dominates the smell . it 's mixed in with a bit of fruit and a bit of earthy hops ( but only when it warms up a bit ) . the taste and mouth are much better . super smooth going down . chocolate , slight coffee , dark fruity malts , slight bit of alcohol and a slight bitterness from an unknown hops ( rounds it out a bit ) . i also detect a herbal ( ? ) taste , gesho root maybe , and the honey adds a minor sweetness , yum . i most certainly will grab a few to cellar . a worthy tribute for miles davis i guess ( though i do n't know if stouts are a miles davis type of brew ) . i 'm sure he would appreciate the complexity though .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	12 oz bottle with bottled on notches of early november , hopefully of 2009 . pours a somewhat hazy , light copper color with a dense , creamy cap of off-white foam . pretty nice looking brew with some great retention and lacing . nose leans toward the malty end of the spectrum , as caramel , honey , light brown sugar and hawaiian bread all come to mind . there is just a mild hint of citrusy ( mostly lemon ) hops , but certainly less than i expect for a pale ale . that said , i am enjoying smelling this beer just fine . i think this would fare ( no pun intended ) better as an amber ale as far as the ratings go . has a nice , graham crackery malt flavor which i find appealing . there is a bit stronger of a hop presence in the finish , bitterness cleans it up fairly well . it is a bit thin , bordering on watery with adequate to slightly low carbonation . some toasty malts come out a bit as it warms up . the beer never tries to be something it is not , even touts on the label as being 'mellow , effortless , groovy ' ... yea , i can dig on that . makes a good throwdown beer that can be sessioned with ease .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.70	appearance : beautiful dark brown body , slightly transparent , big tan head that fills the goblet to the rim , before fading slowly , leaving good lacing . smell : light chocolate and slightly acidic , not very pungent aroma . taste : smooth and fairly good , malt is chocolate and slightly bready . alcohol adds a bite , but the taste is fairly subdued , but delisicous and highly drinkable . mouthfeel : a little watery , but not terrible . drinkability : a very sold american porter .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	a couple months old . poured a clear golden color with a nice and fluffy belgian head . and that was the best feature of this beer . smelled like nothing at first but generic fruitiness came about with warmth . it 's the taste that was really empty : bland and flavorless ; and the mouthfeel was terribly disappointing . had it been crisp and clean , it would have passed off as a decent beer , but the mouthfeel only added to the dullness of this beer -- - oddly creamy with low carbonation , very much opposite of what one would expect from a beer of a style similar to , say , duvel . very disappointing , but not a terrible beer . just very average and not worth paying $ $ $ or trading for . 4 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 3

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	a : pours deep copper , transparent with a light , fizzy head . s : raspberries . t : extremely sour/tart , like eating a raspberry that is no where near it 's full ripeness or crab apples . there is also some toasty/bready notes . m : light and prickly . d : i 'm not crazy about this one .

0.40 0.50 0.20 0.70 0.20	duke `` european-style premium lager '' 330ml bottle , best before 29.04.08 . appearance : pale gold-yellow lager , low head retention , extremely low carbonation . lacing is patchy and only slightly persistent . underwhelming first impression . smell : with no head , it 's hard to get anything out of it , even though it 's a warm morning on the gold coast and my senses should be at their sharpest . faintly sweet grassy aromas , maybe a little bit of fruity yeastiness but that 's about it . taste : quite refreshing , and sweeter than i anticipated . peach flavours , some mildly bitter hops , some citrus zestiness . not overly complex , but satisfying and definitely better than the appearance and smell of the beer would have you believe . mouthfeel : extremely lousy . since this beer is practically flat the instant you crack the lid , there is n't much to get excited about in the mouth . no fizz , just a bland heavy-water feel in the mouth . drinkability : because it feels like you 're drinking dishwater , albeit dishwater that tastes like a good beer , the flat mouthfeel cloys really quickly . i bought a case of these but was disappointed . the first couple of beers are nice and satisfying , but you ca n't get excited about the prospect of drinking this all night . which is hard for me to understand , because i love beer , especially craft brewed . why do n't i enjoy drinking this ? because it 's flat ! overall : i 've tried this on tap at the surf club as well as in the bottle , and i complained to the bar staff , thinking they had n't flushed the lines properly or that there was a pressure leak or something . i had a second one after they 'd checked everything and replaced the keg , and it was still flat . the first mouthful or two in the schooner glass was great , but it got old fast . worth a try i suppose , because there 's not much else on offer up here ! although i did manage to pick up a case of dos equis for $ 25 - ridiculously cheap . even that was more satisfying than this locally brewed craft beer ! but overall this is a let-down . i have n't tried the pale ale yet though , so i wo n't write off this brewery altogether .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90	hazy golden/orange in color with a small but thick head that retains well . lot 's of cool striped lacing around the glass . lacing looks like rings on a tree , marking each sip as the beer gets lower in the glass . wonderful floral hop aroma that smells like being in a flower garden in spring . the bottle says it has a complex hop and malt profile , but this beer is all about the hops . citrus , piney , herbal , floral , this beer has the whole gamut . medium bodied and a bit sticky in the mouth . anytime i go to take another sip , look down and the glass is empty . then i think , `` crap i got this in a trade and it 's gone . '' then it 's a drinkable beer .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.40 0.50	a : the beer pours a clear golden orange color with a short lived white head . s : definitely get some butter up front with a bit of grass , straw , and metal . light malt character with plenty of corn and a bit of table sugar . maybe a touch of honey and overcooked grain . t : tastes very much like candy corn . very sweet and sugary , a strong corn flavor as well and a slight buttery creaminess . hints of straw and grass as well , with almost no bitterness . m : light to medium in body with a medium level of carbonation . o : really a weird flavor . certainly not all that good , but the candy corn flavor was sort of interesting .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.90	pours out a clear , deep amber color with a massive off-white head . there 's a bit of lacing and very good retention . wish it were just a bit darker , but otherwise very nice . the smell is mainly noble hops , maybe just a bit of american in there , or maybe i 'm just thinking of the american approach when i smell it . something new , but not what i hope for in a doppelbock . not even a whiff of dark , sweet , chewy malts . the taste is about the same . a sharp , spicy , minty hoppiness . not a lot of bitterness , maybe it was sucked up by the malt , but i ca n't really taste it either . with some effort , i can taste a bit of caramel sweetness , no chewy , bready maltiness . i like the feeling of the noble hops , but a doppelbock , there 's no doppelbock feeling here . this is more like an alt , and a strong one at that . it still drinks kind of smoothly , with almost no notice of the 7 % abv . it does n't hit the doppelbock spot , but i enjoyed it . do n't expect anything and you 'll probably enjoy it . really a cool and interesting idea , and i 'd reccmmend it for those interested .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	obtained via massive hand trade with most accommodating of bas , merlin48 . thanks buddy . appearance - pours a festive reddish amber . fizzy short-lived head lasts but a few seconds . great start , a little lacking overall though . aroma - spicy nose of cinnamon and allspice , abates after a minute or two , revealing some bready malt and potent alcohol . taste - malt and booze , vaguely similar to beelzebub but softer on the palate . the spices fight to get through and have only limited success . the spices linger on the swallow as the alcohol fades . the finish is sweet , tasty , and warm . a lighter alcohol level would allow more spice development and would improve the profile . mouthfeel - smooth , fairly heavy and coating , average carbonation , all working well together . drinkability - a good beer that improves as it warms but could use more holiday spice flavor sooner . still , if i had access to this it could be an annual tradition .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	i do n't know what i was expecting from this beer . i suppose i wanted it to be ... better . anyway , it looked good out of the bottle . poured into a pint glass the color was golden as advertised with a good head that laced nicely . smelled sweetness and some hops . balanced . taste left some to be desired . the malts and hops were well balanced enough but the aftertaste was not terribly pleasant . there was a slight adjunct taste to this beer . does not compare to other blonde ales i 've had , even though it was n't horrible .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	very limited selections in costa rica allowed me to down everything i could find . considering what is around , i found this beer very good . the largest macro beer in the country is very disappointing . the feel of this beer is somewhat thin but i liked the bock feel that it had . if your going to costa rica try this one last and you will really appreciate it .

0.40 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.40	a - good color , nice light honey-ish amber . head was small and did n't last at all . tried to leave a a little lacing from the tiny ring of head at first , but even that did n't last . really should be more head on an apa than this . s - not bad . lots of malts and yeast smell though and could use more hops to balance . t - this is below average for me . very yeast and to much malt . this beer desperately craves hops . falls far short of what i expect from something that is supposed to be in the apa category . aftertaste , bleh ! very yeasty and becomes somewhat mettalic the longer it lingers . m - mouthfeels pretty good here . nice body and carbonation levels . d - not very drinkable for me . one is definitely enough , the yeastiness of this one just gives and aftertaste that is pretty unpleasant to me . i 'm not impressed at all with this beer . maybe this is a bad batch or something . i can only hope . very yeasty taste and little hop flavor at all . i feel kinda like i 'm drinking liquified bread . i have liked other beers from this brewer so far . 2 left in the variety pack to try , i hope no more are this big of a let down .

0.70 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.90	i had this beer at the great waters facility as we stop in often . i try to take notes on the beers i try but sometimes forget . this one i did have and i am surprised that it is retired as i thought it was very good . it was a nice red color with a thick and creamy head . there was a heavy malt nose that was very pleasant . the attack was very smooth and there was a sweet and smooth flavor with faint hops character at the finish . i do n't think i have had any cask beers at great waters that i did n't like . next time i stop in there i will review the `` place . ''

0.20 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.80	opening this least imaginative packaging i have ever seen with the most minimal design possible can of this closeout 4.49/6pk/16oz offering , i take a sniff and decide it smells kinda like weak corn husks . so i place this sucker to my lips and give this liquid such a kiss that one might think i am french kissing my mistakenly deceased wife i have reunited with after a decade of sorrow while tears stream down my face punishing myself with the carbonation burning my throat and mouth and remembering every negative thing as i drown it in the sorrows of my cheap slightly higher than usual alcohol content fermented corn syrup . this tastes like a slightly soured but the most mellow less biting 5.5 % ice beer . it 's feel in the mouth is quenching and refreshing when guzzled . if you are sipping on this , you are seriously drinking this beverage the wrong way . beers like this are meant to be swilled quickly in great quantitties at a freezing temperature . at least this shit is cheap and does n't make me want to puke after the first can ! titties and beer , titties and beer !

0.60 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.80	pours a bright colored yellow.. frothy head , no retention . not much to say about this one . smells and tastes bland and grain like . almost stale . it is a good beer to party with if all your doin is playin beer pong or circle . i would n't reccomend it for anything else though .

0.60 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.60	on-tap at beachwood bbq , a : pours a hazy burnt orange with a light white head , fair retention , no true lace . s : cotton candy , bubblegum , liquor soaked oranges , a pleasing estery nose . complex for sure , fairly unique in the style . t : sugary candied fruit , yeasty and estery . nice flavour . m : cloying sweet at times , medium-bodied , a tad boozy . d : the beer has its strong points , it started out good , but overall it 's fairly average .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured into pint glass . deep murky brown with a rich foamy head tinted a light beige color -- reminds me of a rootbeer float . smells like brown sugar , dark rum , and gingerbread with a bready , earthy quality ; notes of roasted hazlenut coffee and caramel . deliciously complex and big flavor -- & gt ; starts off as a realized vision of the porter style with balanced huge maltiness and hoppiness - roasted notes - burnt brown sugar with gingerbread bitterness and dark chocolate . long finish but the heretofore spot-on and cooperative development of flavors stratifies into a distinctly chocolately taste juxtaposed with a contemperaneous and undeniable minerally sweetness ; makes for a strange but interesting binarized finale . mouthfeel too prickly and astringent but medium body is appropriate for style . looks and smells excellent , tastes really good , but the mouthfeel could stand improvement .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	i had one of these the other night at the browns taproom ( what a great spot ! ) . the pint glass showed up filled with clear brown goodness , i do n't remember much of a head on it . the aroma was pleasant and typical of wheat beers . the hop and yeast flavor was also characteristic of other weizen - type beers i 've had ( and enjoyed ! ) , but there was definitely more of a malt punch than the lighter varieties . mouthfeel was not particularly big , enough that you knew you were drinking something real but not a facefull . drinkability was excellent . browns has got a very solid beer here and i will be back for more . i am excited to learn more about this style ( maybe try to brew some ) !

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	pours from a 22 oz'er with no freshness date . huge airy thick headcap over a cloudy hazy coppery orange hues . massive pour with plenty of yeasty floaters . drippy thick lace left behind . fruity scents of tangerine are present . big orange slices and orange juice . first swigs : total pale ale is evident . just a totally easy hoppy tangerine . soft flavors like a pale so calling it extra is sort of confusing . a bit too foamy actually . this one takes 5 minutes for the cap to settle to taste it . last swigs : overall enjoyable . a big bargain for $ 3.99 . that 's cheap !

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.90	poured from a 12oz . bottle into a snifter . appearance -after twisting cap , there was little hiss . head is minimal , with no retention and little lacing . a cedar-coloured clear , but not clean looking ale . smell - big , toffee malt inititial aroma . fruity and floral esters . no sign of hoppiness . light musty smell attached to the end of this beer . taste - first , signs of toffee shine through this sweet alcoholic palate . very distinct 'softness ' about this barleywine . the finishing bitterness is more attributable to alcohol content than the hops added , albeit pleasing . mouthfeel - the carbonation , although not very present , has very fine bubbles . medium-thick body carries the flavors in a heavy molasses-like fashion . drink - true to its nature , this barleywine is an excellent sipper . very traditional , within the style , more akin to british barleywines lacking intense hoppiness common amongst american versions . very enjoyable .

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.60	according to bell 's this beer is 4.6 % percent but i guess we 're rounding up here . beer is dark yellow with almost a red hue to it . its also completely hazy like a hefe . white head with some lacing and low carbonation . some cherry in the aroma and some banana esters , smells interesting enough . beer is medium to light in body and kind of boring . its creamy with a mild cherry almost medicinal flavor . the aroma is better than the beer by a lot .

0.90 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.50	app . beautiful copper with a chunky tan head smell . a wonderfully balanced aroma . fruitiness comes from both the malt and the hops which combine to a caramel apple smell . underneath is the earthiness of the dark malt and the htastops bot & which give a spicy , bitter note . taste . here the brew is lacking . the flavor has a slight sweet character up front but is dominated by the roasted malt and hop bitterness . a hint a herbal flavor sneaks out but is truly lost in the bitterness . good medium body with great carbonation .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.70	big ol ' 24oz bottle from premier gourmet in buffalo . pours a radiant crystal clear sunset orange with a couple fingers of tight head . looks good . nose reveals hints of tropical fruits , a real caramel sweetness , pine and citrus . entry is sweet , notes of pineapple and citrus , caramel . long , super bitter piney bitterness , aftertaste almost of pine-sol but i love the hop attack . problem is that it 's too sweet and slightly syrupy , especially evident in the middle . a little harsh and unbalanced overall , big beer and it shows .

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.90	got this at a winehouse in eindhoven , the netherlands . it has a very nice flask , and even better glasses . it is a dutch beer from the bavaria brewery ( the swinckels family owns bavaria ) . the taste is not very different from other pilseners , but it seems a little sweeter and fresher . it is fresh beer , so no conservatives are used . this is what gives it a fresh taste . it is easily drinkable , and has a good after-taste . the downside is the price , at 1,85 euro 's a bottle .

0.60 0.50 0.40 0.70 0.70	glad this was n't the first belgian i ever tried , because it sure as hell would n't have led me to dig any deeper ( like the lovely corsendonk did ) . but , to be fair , it can not be judged by belgium 's super-high standards . this is simply a lager , nothing more , nothing less . a drinkable but average specimen . just unfortunate that , if the average american beer drinker knows of only one belgian , it 's usually this one . looks like the essence of the textbook-definition lager , with a big foamy head that settles slowly , leaving delicate bits of lace all around , and the color being a gold-laced straw-yellow . aroma is light and fruity , some lemon sneaking in ; a little bit of the sweet/salt grain smell that reminds some people of corn , others of urine . i just think it smells like your average everyday lager . flavor shows a citric bite prevailing , ending in a sweet finish that is even a bit puckery . i did n't think this would taste that good after so many years of refining the ol ' palate , but it 's not bad at all . something sort of funny about the mouthfeel , in a bad way . lots of carbonation , fine , that 's expected , but the weird puckeriness carries into the aftertaste , and it 's not pleasant . this is n't quite as bad as the snobs would have you believe . but still , i would n't drink it unless it came to me unsolicited . which this one did . time for a scaldis .

0.60 0.50 0.30 0.50 0.60	a- straw yellow with a quick blitz of carbonation lending a hand to a fast reduction in poor head retention . no lacing s- very faint fruit aroma with whispy grains and tangy hop nose . t- its coors light m/d- when all else fails head for the rockies .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.80 1.00	appearance : orangy amber with small head . smell : floral and fruity . taste : malty , sweet , citrusy , great . mouthfeel : jumping creaminess and bitterness . it is the mouthfeel on this beer that made me remember exactly what it tasted like after not having a bottle for two years . drinkability : gim me more .

0.90 0.50 0.90 0.60 0.70	poured from the bottle into a standard shaker pint glass , bonus points are awarded for the fun-to-watch cascade of swirling browns that slowly dissolve into darkness . it may be a bit of a gimmick , but it is a fun show . once settled , the beer appears almost black , with a bit of reddish-brown glowing around the edges , and a creamiest off-white head layered on top . the aroma is a let-down compared to the spectacle of the pour , with only a faint aroma of toasted malts and maybe a bit of weak coffee with milk . the flavors are likewise muted but still pleasant , with characteristics of nutty coffee and milk chocolate . the flavor is a mere side-show , however , to the texture that is a big reason this beer is so intriguing . the mouthfeel is like a brooklyn egg cream in a way , with a light creaminess that is like a watered-down glass of milk and a bit of selzer-like tingle . overall , guinness draught is rarely my first choice at either the bar or the bottle shop , but it is a classic that i wo n't refuse if offered .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	12 ounce can purchased at tom 's in acme , mi ( $ 6.99/6 pack ) . canned july 7 , 2011 . poured into a nonic pint glass . the pour yields a finger of white head that quickly disappears . lacing is nowhere to be found . a little bit of carbonation is seen through the glass . the brew is colored ... wait for it ... blonde . duh . it is a pretty clear glass of beer with no apparent sediment and only the faintest haze . though blonde ale is not most people 's idea of an impressive beer style , this is easily the most impressive looking beer in the keweenaw canned lineup . pick axe blonde is surprisingly aromatic . fruity aromas are the scents-du-jour . apples are noted . there is also a funky smell that i normally associate with dry red wine . take from that what you will . the flavor shines . this is surprising given a couple of things ; the style 's relative meh-factor , and keweenaw 's relative meh-lineup . it is pretty much an all malt-affair with `` just a kiss of the hops '' as the can 's label lifts from my beloved schlitz . fruity flavors rule the roost with a lot of apple-like flavor up front . some melon rind manifests in the middle . if you 're paying attention some ( very ) mild hop bitterness is detectable . it finishes a little grainy with some lingering aftertaste . easy drinking seems to be the name of the game , but for such a tame beer the taste is surprisingly exceptional . the mouthfeel is incredible . the can claims that this is the lightest bodied brew in the keweenaw lineup but i would have to disagree . it is indeed light bodied , but it is also incredibly creamy . paired with the malty flavor , this blonde is a great experience in the mouth . overall , this is a great example of a light , easy drinking yet flavorful brew . the price point on keweenaw beers has recently dropped dramatically , making this a pretty good value to boot . i dig it , and i really think my light lager drinking buddies would dig it too . at this point it 's the only one of keweenaw 's canned efforts that i could wholeheartedly recommend . -- - the two-schlitz scale : ( reference my profile for an explanation ) even keweenaw acknowledges the mighty schlitz , lifting their `` kiss of the hops '' trademark for pick axe blonde . it is indeed a fine comparison and i could easily interchange pick axe as an ale substitute for schlitz . as such , i do give a schlitz for pick axe blonde .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	got a 'good ' pour on this one . deep brownish black with light tan luxurious head . appearance was perfect , really is a 5 , it will never be improved upon . faint smells of toast and coffee in the back . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and is an area for this brew that counts for much more than 10 % of the experience very dry finish , aftertaste does not linger . all around not a perfect beer , but appearance and mouthfeel make it a true classic .

0.90 1.00 1.00 0.80 0.60	looks great , not much to say . it 's a good beer . smells sweet , like pineapple and grain but it sure as hell does n't taste that way . it 's still good , but the pineapple gets destroyed by grapefuit and hops . feels full-bodied and malty . it draws the saliva from your tongue in a way that 's interesting and just plain enjoyable . the hops become a novelty after a while , to the point of certain heartburn . at 7.2 % this would put me on my scrawny ass way too fast to session .

0.20 0.40 0.60 0.30 0.20	poured a very ugly burnt orange/amber color with no head and no lacing . smells like caramel malts and not much else . taste is slightly sweet up front and slightly bitter at the end . not much in the way of flavor on this one . tastes like water with a little bit caramel malts . this one just disappoints me like no other . it 's a horrid beer .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.70	i drink stella periodically but this time it tastes really average . it is upsetting that a lager with a 650-year heritage has dwindled into mediocrity over the course of mere decades , due to its change from a beer at the forefront of western european lager to one aimed at the masses with money in mind . it is still definitely potable but it has lost its je ne sais quoi that made the beer as popular as it has become . cheaper beers that do the same job can be found , in particular ( in australia ) with the dutch lager hollandia .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90	poured 750ml bottle into sa pint glass . a : pours a hazy golden-straw color with a ginormous head ! probably a good 4:1 ratio of head to beer ! and man did the head stay around forever ! left lacing everywhere once it decided to go down a bit . s : pepper , spice , and yeast in the nose . slight floral qualities , and noticeable brett . t : fruity sweetness at first ; green apple and lemon , but then suddenly gives way to an earthy hoppiness that dominates the finish . m : medium-light in body . surprisingly , i felt like a few sips were a bit on the watery side , but only very slightly . d : tasty , complex , and very refreshing ! very glad to have picked this one up , and i would seek it out again .

0.60 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	poured from 12-ounce bottle into pilsner glass ; best by date of 11.2011 on bottle a - the jever pilsener poured up a very pale and clean straw color similar to many american adjunct lagers . it had a bit more respectable amount of head , but like those aal 's , it dissipated quickly and left no lacing . i ca n't knock the color , but i would have hoped for a bit more head or lacing . 3 of 5 s - there is a respectable aroma to the beer , but i do n't know how best to describe it . it has a bit of grainy or dry grassy smell that is similar to most pilsners but somehow different . i wish i had a better grasp of my olfactory senses so that i could describe the smell better ... regardless of my shortcomings , the aroma of this one was better than average 3.5 of 5 t - the beer has much more pronounced bitterness than many pilsners that i 've tried . the jever has more than average bitterness , but not so much as to make it odd for the style as it retains the bready finish characteristic of pilsner ... 4 of 5 m - the brew seemed to be slightly flat , but not too far out of the norm for the style . as expected , it was an easy drinker 2.5 of 5 . overall - though no one area was exceptional , and most were merely average , i really enjoyed drinking the jever . it is plenty tasty and quite satisfying . i would certainly buy this one again . 4 of 5

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.30 0.20	pours a very clear yellow with surprisingly nice white head . smells metallic and like some grain , but very faint overall . flavour is about as close to nothing as beer could be , but a little off tinge to it . ok carbonation . drinkability is not good as i do not want another one . oh well , at least i tried a beer from spain .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.90	appearance : a nice two fingers of head that sustained admirably but did not lace . the body is a bright , almost white wine white with ample carbonation in the body . smell : smells like it looks , like wine minus the alcohol . it makes it 's presence known well enough and warming helps to bring out notes of lemon and light floral hops . all in all nice but nothing to write home about . taste : neat and clean , as it starts with a very mild biscuit malt that turns to a mixture of malt and grapes and ends with the barest dusting of hops . very smooth , albeit light to the taste and could certainly be a bit more flavourful , but i liked it . mouthfeel : my biggest problem is , it is very similar to diluted wine . it 's got some odd acidic notes which i do n't like . that and i really wish there was a bit more of a hop presence . also no aftertaste at all to speak of . still the carbonation is superbly done . drinkability : yeah ... .i polished this off before i could finish typing the whole review . crisp and clean but not to the point you 'd say it 's watered down and light . it 's just a bid odd to drink because of the taste . the complete lack of hop presence make this easy to guzzle . final thoughts : i 've called duvel the champagne of beer before , and when i drink this , i ca n't help but feel this is the spumante bambino . cheap , bubbly tastes like wine , not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but your wallet leaves you far more inclined to buy it at new years . i 'd pick it up again in the summer . heck , i 'd be tempted to just drink it from a bomber .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	pours a very dark amber with fluffy and lingering carbonation . aroma has nice nuttiness from seemingly a large dose of chocolate malt . no perceptible smell from hops . great chocolate malt flavor . there 's also a sweet character to this reminds me a little of malto-meal . dare i say that i would drink this beer for breakfast ? ? ? there , i said it . mouthfeel is sticky-sweet and dense . i would expect it to be a little more dry , and given the style it should be a little less dense . the finish has a little hop bitterness , which works well . this is a terrificially balanced , smooth brown ale and also very drinkable .

0.90 0.70 0.30 0.40 0.30	deep brownish black body with a lovely huge monster tan foamy head that includes some huge hollow bubbles . like what you get if you made a root beer float . nose is a soft chocolatey malt feel with a bit of smokieness on the side . now this is where the brew goes south for me ... enters the mouth kide day old cold coffee and quickly sours on the second half of the palate , which is not what i expexted . finishes with that same sour and maybe a hint of nuttiness . where is the oak and i was expecting a little more dark richness , and complexity from the look in the glass and from what i had heard about this beer , but polar oppisites . odd , but i guess i could have had a bad bottle . ?

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60	12oz bottle . golden color , bubbly.tastes much like it smells . i 'm a big fan of wheat beers and sierra nevada pale ale is great but this just is n't doing it ... it leaves this sour aftertaste - but this could just be me , everyone else is reviewing it fairly high .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.70	aroma : strong citrusy hops . this beer has very little malt . appearance : this beer has a honey golden color . the beer is slightly cloudy . although it is a filtered beer . there is a thick white head on the beer . mouthfeel : this beer has a very light mouth feel . there is virtually no carbonation that comes through in the beer . although , it is a carbonated beer . taste : this beer is permeated by hops . the citrus flavor dominates the mouth when consumed . there is a little touch of a carbonated feel at the back of the mouth when consuming this beer . drinkability : this beer is a solid example of a pale ale . the hops are the dominate flavor but there is a slight flavor of the malt as the beer warms . the alcohol is not to high in this beer either . this is a must try . a unique aspect of the beer is that it comes in a can .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	my girlfriend is all about this beer , so i thought it was time to sit down and finally give it a chance . a- very black in color with a thick and creamy light brown head . this is not as dark as they come , but it does absorb light . the head has very good retention . s- very sweet and english smelling with some chocolate and just a hint of coffee . not super roasty . i also pick up hints of vanilla and anise . very refreshing smelling t- not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe . there is a lot more of a roasty flavor than there is in the nose , but it is actually really interesting . this has quite the milk stout characteristic to it . m- luxuriously creamy . the carbonation is just right here . d- it is a tad on the sweet side , but it is a very enjoyable beer , and even more interesting since it came from sri lanka .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.40	a : had on tap at the laurelwood public house recently . rating based on notes that i took at that time . poured an amber color , not much head . slight lacing down the glass . s : smells strangely like vinegar to me . slight hop scent as well . t : slight sweet taste , but does not taste much like anything actually , fairly bland m : smooth , light on carbonation . d : mouthfeel was nice , went down easily enough just did n't care for the smell or taste of the beer . by far my least favorite brew i tried at laurelwood .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.80	pours an amber color with a small brown head that dies off quickly and does n't leave any lacing on the glass . the aroma has a caramel malt character and some sweetness . the flavor is nice and malty with some bready character . the mouthfeel is way thin , but drinkability is ok .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	a- thin tan head on a prettty much black body . s- roasted and burnt malts , chocolate , oatmeal , some light coffee , and just a hint of grass hops . t- flavor follows the aroma . the oatmeal is nice a present in this one and not much coffee ( which is always a plus in my book ) . dry burnt malt aftertaste with a little bitterness lingering on the tongue . some oatmeal left in the aftertaste as well . m- medium body with medium carbonation . a bit to high carbonation for this brew but still has a light creaminess to it . just a tad bigger body with fit it nicley also . d- a very nice easy drinking oatmeal stout . nice blend of flavors just mouthfeel is lacking a bit imo . also the head could of been a lot better especially due to how much carbonation . overal a damn decent brew .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	i poured this brew in a tulip glass as recommended on the bottle . smells of black and red licorice , alcohol and coffee and maybe some smoked almonds . on initial taste , what stands out is the sweetness and alcohol in this beer as well as roasted malts . although it is brewed with coffee it was not a stand out in taste . you definitely notice coffee and dark chocolate in the after taste but i was hoping for more in the taste . i think this beer would taste better if the abv was brought down from 12 % . the syrupy sweetness and taste of alcohol is too much for me . i 've had beers with 12 % and 13 % abv where it is not as prominent as it is in this brew . i feel let down since this beer is so sweet and it was ranked so high on the best of ba list . medium to heavy body with nice roasted maltiness and low hops . good for after dinner dessert drinking but maybe not for game time .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	a-a cloudy orange with have a finger head that lingers s-cherry , more cherry and by the way you smell cherry . t-a very sweet cherry flavor . the wood notes come in , but do not mesh perfectly with the cherry flavors . m-light and dry d-the sweetness is a constant fight with the dryness in a battle over drink ability . edit-i got my hands on another bottle , which i know was taken better care of and this one tasted a lot better ( changed the ratings )

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	very light amber in colour with a good amount of carbonation . aromas of yeast , lemon , and flower petals . flavor wise , its like a slightly malty saison : citrus flavors ( mainly orange ) with horse blanket yeasty flavors and a bit of hops . the mouthfeel is great on this one too , effervescent and full at the same time . this is some great stuff !

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.70	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter . appearance : pours a very hazy orangish-brown , with a finger-and-a-half of white head . left a good bit of lacing . smell : subdued grassy and piney hops . taste : watery hops , and not much else . incredibly one dimensional , with almost nothing to stand up to the hops . the first ipa i 've had that actually tastes like `` hop water '' . nice bitter aftertaste , however . mouthfeel : nicely carbonated and good level of thickness - probably the best part of this beer . drinkability : well , it 's very easy to put this down , if for no other reason than there 's not much to it . drinks more like a pale ale than an ipa . just tastes like watered down hops . there are plenty of other , better ipas out there .

0.60 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.60	clear amber in color with very little carbonation and a very meager head . the aroma is surprisingly citric with a noticeable , fairly medicinal alcohol scent . the flavor starts off with a brown-sugar maltiness , quite hoppy in the finish , with an aftertaste that as at once bitter and sugary sweet . alcohol has a bit too much bite in the rear , leading this beer to be both harsh and cloyingly sweet at the same time . something of an accomplishment , i suppose ! full bodied and a bit oily in texture . the flavor does improve as you work your way down the bottle , though that might just be the alcohol talking . adding the yeast seems to help too . i like moylan . i really do . and so i was surprised at my disappointment with this beer . but then , consider their christmas ale ... a bit of an uneven brewery , this .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	sampled on 6-9-07 pours the color of a black hole , with a fizzy head that fades to nothing . smell is roasted malts , with a lot of caramel and some smokiness . taste is semi-sweet with tons of coffee bitterness at the beginning . the finish is smooth with quite a bit of coffee flavor followed by notes of smoke and molasses . mouthfeel is very good , super smooth and slick . drinkability is also very good , extremely well balanced sweetness and bitterness . overall , i miss drinking stouts . so many are offered during the winter , and pulled in the summer . a good beer and a special treat .

0.90 0.80 0.20 0.40 0.20	12oz bottle obtained via trade with crjmellor . thanks for the opportunity ... poured into a rapscallion glass , formed a 1/2 '' tan head over the clear bright chestnut brew . head is down a layer of bubbles pretty quick , with froth around the rim and nice lacing , esp for the abv and style . aroma is heavy sryupy sweetness and alcohol , no hiding the power of this brew here . flavor is , umm , overpowering to say the least . alcohol overpowers all , leaves little room for any other brewing art to shine . mouthfeel and drinkability are just so rough , i 'm not sure if i 'll be drinking this . probably be numb in a few minutes and be able to choke it down , but why bother ? seemingly another case of harsh for harshness ' sake .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.60	reviewed 10/19/2007 ( sampler @ nxnw brewery , austin , tx ) : pours a dark brown body , very dark reddish in color , with a white-tannish colored head . has a very sweet malty aroma , tastes like a red ale . chocolatey taste , some roasted notes , and maltiness .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	12oz bottle to a kronenbourg tulip bottled on 9-3-08 a : a steady pour produced a 2-finger eggshell white head . this reduced to a 1/2 finger foamy cap within just a minute or so . color was yellow to straw colored with haze as expected of a witbier . no lace s : citrus-y with lemon and orange peel , with hints of vanilla and coriander . a faint pale malt and banana aroma was also detected . t : upfront with honey and citrus with a very refreshing acidic and spicy tartness on the front of the palate while finishing dry with the ever so slight hop bittering . pale malt taste was also present but not overshadowing the sweetness . m : light and creamy with good carbonation giving a well rounded feel . dry on finish . d : boy , this would be great on a hot day . unfortunately , its about 35 degrees but still good nonetheless . could be come cloyingly sweet

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	thanks to eric ( turdfurgison ) for hooking me up with a bottle of this one . served in a new belgium tulip . a - pours with a ridiculously large head that quickly sizzles away to a thin cap , leaving a few spots of lace behind . the body is black with no hint of color at the fringes . other than being obnoxious to pour this looks pretty good . s - huge wet wood and astringent burnt flavors . reminds me of some of cigar city 's less successful barrel-aging experiments . there 's some light chocolate and caramel malt when it warms up , along with some fusel alcohol and a touch of bretty pineapple . t - extremely heavy with burnt , roast , and char notes , with plenty of oak , smoke , and a touch of plastic as well . not much overt bourbon flavor - mostly earthy . thankfully there is n't any overt sign of infection in the flavor . m - smooth , but overly thin body , low carbonation ( it 's all in the head ) . finishes sticky . d - this was n't horrible , but it was n't great either - all of us managed to finish our glasses . i 'd much rather have the regular imperial stout trooper . i get a faint hint of infection , and the feel and look was reminiscent of churchill 's finest hour . warts and all , this was still better than the white birch travesty .

0.50 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.90	33cl into a tulip . pours nearly clear very light pale straw . dense pure white head while not towering is very slow to recede . aroma is mild and pleasant . lots of doughy white bread yeast atop light citrus and early summer fruits . taste is exceedingly mild , mostly diluted citrus with a hop backup . aftertaste is fleeting . thin , watery mouthfeel . served well chilled on hot summer day this would go down very nice after any labor ! this would also pair well with any delicate food as to not complicate your palate . while not a brew to be chosen when intending to savor what you sip , it is perfect for specific moments - in those moments it is an assured a. cheers jd

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.80	had on tap at canyon 's in boone nc cloudy amber & light brown in color , with a quarter inch head that retains well . smell is caramel , nutty , peat moss . taste is much the same with some cherry flavor and a nice hoppy finish . feels very good in the mouth . chewy and dry . nice session beer .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	poured from a bottle into my pint glass . a : pitch black hue . about a fingers worth of mocha hued head . no lace . tiny flecks of setiment float through out the beer . s : super sweet chocolate is the main thing that i get at first . the beer is sitting a foot away from me and all i can smell is cocoa puffs . upon further inspection there 's a good amount of roast black coffee in there as well . t : straight up bitter black coffee . maybe a touch of dark chocolate . that 's it . m : thin body with almost no carbonation at all . d : overall there are parts of this beer that work . however they simply ca n't overcome it 's short comings . i think i will pass .

0.60 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80	a staple beer . : ) a : like any other cheap beer , competently manufactured/processed s : smelled nice , better than regular bud or coors or high life , etc ... . t : very malty and sweet . like candy . m : nothing notable for mouthfeel ... tingly on the tongue enough to make me feel alive d : very drinkable . i could drink this all day long and drink many more without incident .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	pours an opaque orange/gold with an ok head . no retention at all . some sweet wheat and yeast in the nose . looking for spice or fruit , not getting much . some wheat and grain . a bit coarse in some husk bitterness . in fact , this one is over-bitter . finish is fairly clean . i 'm looking for more and just not getting it . lighter bodied . good carbonation . did n't really dig this . grain flavors were ok , but this one lacks drinkability and complexity . just barely ok .

0.80 0.90 0.70 0.90 1.00	deep crimson hue with a slight haze . covered by a one fingered , persistent , dense , light tan head . sparse lace remains . notes of red licorice and vanilla bean upfront in aroma . following are hints of tart , underripe cherry and butterscotch . damp wood and musty earth notes add a rustic contrast . trace minty ethanol and clove phenol . very well rounded , yet seductive aromawise . incipient in flavor is a combination of lightly sweetened dry cocoa and ripe cherry . becomes transiently tropical in ester character , with mellow banana esters ensuing concomitantly with hints of pineapple . oak character is steadfast throughout and adds a complementary buttery vanilla bean note along with an agreeably slight woody , tannic bitterness . spicing is incredibly well integrated and combines with malt and ester profile seemlessly . nearly overt is a juniper like note and dried orange peel tinge . devoid of alcohol abrasiveness , with only a comforting , enveloping warmth emerging after a deliberation . hop bitterness is appropriately meager , yet suffices to preclude overbearing residual sweetness . a touch shy in body to support the complex and supple malt backbone . a notch more of dextrins would complete it . surprisingly moderate in carbonation for a `` saison '' . finishes with fleeting hints of clove sprinklied vanilla sugar cookie and trace minty ethanol . quite a delicious brew that 's superlatively drinkable as well . heavy handed in vanilla character , but not cloying at all . posseses an elegant ester and spice balance . with a greater malt complexity this would be amongst the best . wonderful .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	a-50w motor oil about sums up the appearance . smooth black with a lacy fine brown head . the color was of black tar , or motor oil from the oil pan of an old beat up pick up truck like the one in bodie california . s-smooth sweet aroma . m-creamy and smooth , though not as thick of a beer as i was expecting . t-slight hint of bourbon , smokey . f-slight warm twinge of alcohol . tasty and toasty with a slight kiss of bourbon flavor . light bodied for what i was expecting , but then it does n't claim to be a porter or stout . the mounthfeel leads me to think if not for the high alcohol content this is a beer that would be easy to drink a lot of with out filling up . a lot of flavor for a very drinkable beer .

0.50 1.00 0.50 1.00 0.80	appearance : pours a cola brown color with neither head nor lacing smell : exquisite aromatics - caramel , dates , chocolate and , of course , whiskey and vanilla but the balance is what sets this apart taste : the caramel , chocolate and dark fruit flavors blend together up front , with the whiskey barrel and vanilla aspects building toward mid-palate ; after the swallow , the balance of flavors is very pleasant , with the whiskey touch adding complexity but never overwhelming the balance mouthfeel : thick and syrupy , with no carbonation drinkability : despite the lack of carbonation , this is one very nice barleywine that has benefited from a few years of age thanks , beandip , for the opportunity

0.70 0.80 0.70 0.20 0.40	11.2oz bottle poured into a pint glass . pours a golden , light yellow color with a huge , fizzy white head . head is slow to dissipate but eventually becomes a 1/2 finger foamy , white cap . decent lacing left on glass . smells sweet and fruity up front . ripe green apples are prominent , along with some other fruity aromas . belgian yeast comes through along with a sweet , almost sugary aroma . taste is nowhere near the nose . quite bland compared to the aromas . a slight fruit character shows up but there 's not much to it . in fact , a slight candied sugar flavor comes up at the end but that about it . really not much flavor at all . light body with light but lively carbonation that feels prickly on the tongue . goes down smooth with a slight aftertaste that i ca n't quite put my finger on . drinkability is low with this one . the nose is pretty good but the taste is severely lacking . perhaps the nose makes the lack of flavor stand out that much more or maybe the lack of flavor makes a decent nose smell great . although the beer is not completely undrinkable , it is devoid of much flavor .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.40 0.30	22oz bottle . i have mixed feelings going into this . one one hand , i love the standard stone irs . on the other hand , im not a huge licorice fan and i hear thats the dominating taste here . well see . into the stone irs glass . a- the beer pours out an opaque black body with a small coffee colored head on top . the head has moderate retention and leaves behind small rings of lacing . so far so good . s- and heres the anise . strong odor of black licorice comes from my glass and nearly overpowers everything else . im able to pick out some roasted malts as well as some dark chocolate . coffee at the end . nothing from the belgian yeast . t- the anise is back with a vengeance . dark roasted malts show up only to be moved out of the way by a sickening amount of black licorice . ugh . i cant finish this . m- the body is full . the carbonation is at a nice subdued level . o- ill never buy this again . the use of anise is overdone to say the least . they have hidden almost nearly every other aspect of the stone irs with licorice . this is only my third drainpour . gross . avoid . want my other bottle ?

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	reviewed 1/9/2010 ( bottle ) : pours a dark brown color body , somewhat see thru held up to the light . some small dark tan colored head . dark almost dirt smell , heavy roasted flavors . strong grape aroma too , purple grape juice . some alcohol . not too heavy , somewhat creamy mouthfeel . odd flavor . a little better as it warms .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	a - clear golden straw color with high carbonation . nice high , white head that fades quickly to a covering . s - lots of fruitiness on the nose , but a lambic like sourness as well . t - lots of light malt flavors with a good dose of ripe fruit . then that sourness hits again , perhaps what is good in a champagne is coming through too strong and even a bit of an offensive aftertaste . m - nice light feel with a crisp finish , accentuated with a alcohol warmth . d - i must admit , i am glad this is a limited release ... not too many people should have to spend so much on it .

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.70 0.40	12 oz , bottled in 2004 , served in a flute glass . a : pours a deep dark brown that appears nearly black . 1/8 '' head quickly fades to a thin film . very little lacing on the glass . s : raisins , molasses , dark coffee , alcohol . t : raisin and molasses sweetness , thick malt , coffee and alcohol bitterness . leaves a dull bitter aftertaste . m : full bodied , some creaminess , low carbonation . d : abv is excessively high , and it 's quite coarse . a bit pricey too for just a 12 ounce bottle .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.50	a-pours a golden color , bright , slight haze to it with some sediment floating around . the head is fluffy and bubbly with an off white head . s-hints of sourness with a touch of funky earthiness . notes of bubblegum , vinegar , chocolate undertones . t-lots of sourness in the taste , an earthy soil like funk , dry chocolate , tobacco , smoked peat , hints of peach and bubblegum in the back . m-rough and grainy on the palate , messy carbonation , astringent in the back , medium body . d-a little rough on the palate with the huge carbonation and extremely grainy feel . the flavors are interesting , not bad but they do n't seem to mesh that well together .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80	never took the time to try this , so i grabbed it at the store and poured it into my pint glass ... a : like a typical nitro-can stout , this pours thick like a milkshake and the head slowly creeps away and yields a nice dark brew . the 1 finger nitro head lasts the whole time . s : smell is nice , light and refreshing with espresso beans , chocolate ice cream , coffee and dry roasted malts . t : nice and light with espresso beans , light milk chocolate , dark bitter roast . everything is there , but everything is real light in flavor , which was expected . m , d : not the biggest fan of nitro , as it seems pretty flat . overall , this is a decent irish dry stout that is very refreshing and i could sit down and have a few of these .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	served in a hill farmstead wine glass . pours near black with a half-finger tan head after a hard pour . retention is n't the best . there is a touch of lacing around the edges of the glass , as well as a bit of bubbling on the top of the liquid . a good swirl kicks back up a pretty good head , and there 's quite a bit more lacing after that . the nose is fairly intense with some nice roast and chocolate notes , reminding me of a lighter imperial stout . through the malt character comes a strong dose of earthy hops with a bit of pine . the flavor is lush and thick , aided by the hefty mouthfeel . there are undertones of star anise throughout , coming in alongside quite a bit of booze . there are slight notes of chocolate , though the hops really are n't all that present here . mouthfeel is quite thick , with alcohol taking over in the finish to the point where it 's all that 's left after a second or two . at this point , this beer is just way too boozy . picking this up , i had n't bothered to look at the alcohol content and i slightly regret opening this bottle at this point in time . i really think it 's more toward the american strong ale category , and there are n't all that many hops to fall out with a bit of aging .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	batch 2 , 2006 . pours black with a small dark tan head and good lacing . scent of dark fruit , roasted malts , maple syrup and chocolate . good , but not particularly impressive . taste of maple syrup , chocolate , dark fruits , and roasted malts . finishes with roasted malts and a lingering oak flavor . again not really impressive , but it is a good over the top imperial stout . mouthfeel is as heavy and thick as they come .

0.50 0.30 0.70 0.30 0.50	i simply do n't feel like writing my typical dissection review for this one . marzen was originally crafted as a lightly malted , lightly hopped beer to drink in vast quantities . this fits those marks . excellent clarity , minimal head , nutty malty nose , decent hop balance , lightly metallic note in the finish of the flavor , light mouthfeel , high carbonation , clean finish . above average for the style but certainly not on par with spaten or even clawhammer . that was on 12/22/2008 . on the new batch , 2010 , this beer has gotten far worse . the aroma is of cracker malt and almost an adjunct note , much like the nose of a yuengling or coors original , but with a little more biscuit and a hint of outhouse . flavour is not better . tastes adjunct-ish , with stale crackers and stale hops . this is just bad . drain pour . come on , bell 's .

0.60 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60	pretty boring tripel . a - pale yellow body with a bright white foamy head . s - smells corny , like so many mexican lagers . t - bland honey sweetness . hardly any alcohol kick . hardly any character to mention . unobtrusive , but tasty if that 's what you 're looking for . m - bah , not worth mentioning . d - sure it goes down great if you want something super sweet , but if you 're looking for a proper tripel you 'll be disappointed .

0.60 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	clear gold not much head on the pour . very little aroma - a hint ogf something herbal maybe . lightly bitter with a floral note , and a little bit of citrus . light body with a sharp carbonation - a bit too much i think . otherwise , drinkable and refreshing , but that 's it really .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.80	had trades fall through for this one on several occasions , and it became especially difficult after the whole george lucas thing happened . finally got hooked up with this one in a big trade with nycwheatfansc . thanks a lot man ! from a 750 into a snifter vintage : 2009 appearance : pours out relatively thick and makes a 2+ finger , tight , thicker looking mocha colored head that cascades upwards nicely after the pour . great retention as well . jet black body and zero carbonation evident . head slowly recedes to a good wisp , clinging to the sides on the way down . wisp remains until the end , rejuvenating after each sip , and leaves some nice lacing down the glass . a slightly thicker pour would give this a perfect score . really good looking . smell : roasted malts and dark baker 's chocolate mostly . hints of molasses , but very chocolate dominated . decently bold as well . taste : roasted malts , dark baker 's chocolate again with some sweet caramel malt and bigger coffee and chocolate at the finish . not as chocolaty as the nose had suggested , but more complex . bitter-sweet caramel and roasted aftertaste is mild yet lingers nicely . good flavors , but still not as big as others in the style . palate : full body and creamy on the palate , with medium , soft carbonation . goes down smooth but finishes slightly astringent . great feel in the mouth , but a little too astringent after the swallow . score balances out here . overall : a high quality , medium strength imperial stout . it 's not quite as big as others in the style obviously , but it 's certainly tasty and is definitely a beauty pageant contestant . the finish , however , was unfortunately a little too astringent . fix that up a little and you 'd have a fantastic mouth-feel as well . despite the slight flaw , this was an easy imperial stout to drink down and i would love the chance to have it again . thanks again for the trade nyc !

0.70 0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60	served at the bar out of tap , barcelona lager was prominent on the serving glass . clear light yellow , no lacing , low carbonation . this bar just opened ~2 weeks ago . was a clean hoppy beer not over powering hops . did not smell anything . mouth feel was very thin . like the beer was water . on last few mouthfuls detected a slight butter taste in the ending . i am not into hop beers so i might have been a bit biased . would not drink again . cheers

0.90 0.60 0.30 0.40 0.40	this beer poured a strong golden amber with a very attractive sugar-white head with some lacing , and smelled primarily of blueberry with other berry fruits , some strawberry , maybe cherry . the taste was a completely different story ; the flavor was very disappointing . it started a bit bitter with some hop notes coming through and sweetened into a blueberry-like flavor with an artificial blueberry taste at the end . in fact it finished very flat and water-like with a bubbly , watery mouthfeel . when i burped i was revisited by the artificial-like aftertaste of the beer . in fact , this beer reminded me more of flavored seltzer water than of beer . the label stated that it was made with natural blueberry flavors , but i think marin brewing failed to harness the awesome power of the blueberry . being that blueberries are my favorite fruit in the world , i was excited to try this one . but i found it to be unpalatable . i dumped the remainder of the 22 down the sink . note : i did notice a slight bluish tint to the beer as i poured it down the sink . i guess that 's the artificial coloring mentioned on the label ; it did n't show in the glass at all . i had to cleanse my palate after this beer with a wipeout ipa .

0.70 0.80 0.30 0.40 0.40	appearance : pretty solid . it 's your normal blackish stout , but there 's something i do n't like about the head . smell : the high point of this beer . it has a very familiar coffee smell that i found appealing and also unique . there 's something bordering on fruitiness as well . taste : nosedive . it retains some of that coffee aspect , though nowhere near what i was smelling , but an unwanted tartness is present . it also seems very water-like , in terms of flavor not consistency , which is odd and repulsive . mouthfeel : okay , it has a watery consistency too . totally not what i 'm looking for . drinkability : i suppose i could drink a few of these , but i would n't want to . actually , i might get sick after two . beef notes : if you 're a stout lover , you should try this beer . trust me , you 'll appreciate every other stout that much more . wait , what am i saying ? stay away !

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	pours a cloudy chestnut brown with a big thick frothy head that is still around at the very last sip . i got subdued aromas of woody smoke , bbq pork and a bit of dark fruit . flavors are much of the same , not as smokey as i like it but i really like the smoke flavor . thought that i got more wood and well seasoned meat , salty chinese bbq pork ribs is what i am thinking . in fairness i should mention that i am drinking this with a nicely seasoned rib eye for dinner . extremely smooth and really perfect on the palette , excellent ! i would drink this all night but honestly not as flavorful as the schlenkerla urbier or marzen , but very nice still and it is it 's own beer . over all very nice and would get again .

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	a- small off white head with okay retention and weak lacing . s- mild malt aroma , caramel and bread . some nice hop and fruity aromas i am guessing apricot . t- sweet fruity flavors with mild tartness . light malt and dry bitterness in th end . m- nice light oily feeling . with a wave of tart and dryness in the end . yet another beer with fruit added to it that i do not enjoy .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.70	cool trappist bottle into a snifter ... orange . orangest beer i 've seen . looks like orange juice - with pulp . huge marshmellow head . pleasing scent . i think the color is making me smell oranges . got a little bite to 'er . stong flavor . whoa . good . mouthfeel is the worst characteristic to this beer . it taste so good but the feel is really harsh . overall : best tripel i 've had in my limited beer career .

0.60 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	pours a hazy golden color . no head or lacing on a very conservative pour to try to leave the yeast in the bottle . still a little yeast floating around . smell is of peaches and apricots . taste is very bready and a little buttery . also some lemon zing . reminds me of a wheat beer . lots of carbonation kind of makes the mouth tingle . this is n't a bad beer , but for some reason i found it hard to finish . overall it 's not a bad beer , but i do n't know if i will revisit again .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60	served on draft into a mug . this bock beer poured a very clear dark reddish brown color . it produced a thin white head that had poor head retention . there was a very small amount of thin lacing left behind . the aroma was a soft malty smell , maybe a sight amount of toasted malt . the bock tasted sweet and there was not much of a toasted malt flavor that you would expect from a bock beer . there is a very slight hint of hop bitterness . i would classify this as having a light to medium body . this beer is a nothing more then a gateway beer- if used for that purpose fine , but its good for not much else . this does not hold a candle to shiner bock .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	bottled as btet barley wine . moves my rating from nynshamns barley wine to this one ... pours a nice deep red color with a small white foamy head , leaving some lacing on the glass . smell is nice and malty . lots of caramel and dried fruits . very fruity-aleish in a english-styled way . a bit vinous . seems interesting ! taste is sweet , malty with notes of dried fruits , toffee/caramel and liquorice . a bit `` peppery '' and spicey with warming alcohol . very nice . mouthfeel is very nice and filling . liquid is very smooth , the carbonation is low and the beer seems very fullbodied . a bit oily . this is a very nice sipper and nynshamn does n't dissapoint . good ! very malty and english in the style - perfect when you want something else than the more regular american `` hop bomb '' !

0.70 0.60 0.20 0.50 0.40	brown . dry as hell in the nose with notes of wet cardboard , coffee beans , dark fruits and bitter chocolate . dryness continues with a lackluster malt accented flavor profile of caramel , bitter chocolate and coffee beans . complete lack of body . astringent and somewhat moldy .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	this beer is right up my alley . glad i tried it . a - nice dark amber . probably my personal favorite color for a beer . s - i got some caramel and breads did n't really reveal the hops , although smell is not my strong suit . t - very malty , very tasty . i was surprised how good it was and how balanced the hop finish was . it was so balanced . not being a hop head i do enjoy a beer with some hops but does n't taste like i am drinking pine cones . m - nothing special . did not add or distract . just a regular lager thing . d - good year round beer . could not think of a time where this would be inappropriate . perfect amount of alcohol to drink just one or linger over a couple through an afternoon or evening . an above average lager with good taste and a great price tag of $ 5.99 . will return .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.70	v.07 light amber pour with a mildy agressive head intially , resolving itself to become a thin foam topping . very light residual carbonation . nice , fruity/gueuze-like nose , without any any meaningful significance . again , mh disappoints when the tastbuds become involved . initially , there is flavorful apricot malt , that quickly disappates into a thin interpretation of what i 'm looking for in `` a beer '' . very one note than falls flat quick . creamy mouth that hangs around too long . due to it 's watered-down body , this can be enjoyed for quite a few . if you 're looking for `` a few '' with actual taste & enjoyment , most assuredly not . if this was crisper , with a bit more definition & assertiveness , it would be easily quaffable for quite a few . as it stands , try one and move on .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	sampled may 2011 same color head and body , three-finger thick head in large tripel karmeliet tulip ; lots of lacing . aromas of hemp oil , pine are definitely dominant ; the hemp character almost has a nuttiness to it that one finds in actual hemp seeds . there is a touch of garlic chive here , though it is not so much that i find it objectionable . there is a big , hop-fruit character underneath the up front hop character that is big on lychee and floral apricot as well as some actual spicy floral notes . there is a nice biting bitterness up front in my first sip and this bitterness continues through to the finish where it is clean and biting ; it is actually quite a bit more clean than i would have guessed it would be . up front the herbaceous , hemp oil dankness pervades the palate , but there is a lot of tropical fruit and ripe floral fruit notes that competes with the herbal notes in the middle of a sip . the fruit character is also found up front of each sip , though it doesnt linger much in the finish ; flavors of lychee , floral tangerine , the herbal notes are actually a bit more dominant than the fruit character here . interestingly enough the hop character is big enough in this beer ( at least today ) that i am not noticing the malt as much as i did in the hallertau mittelfrueh . the malt character , while more subtle adds notes of toasty , caramelized whole grain , light biscuit notes and some cracker like notes . the herbal character is a bit astringent at times , though it is not nearly as much as many an ipa . the body of this beer is still a bit more chewy and viscous than i would prefer in an ipa , though it is perhaps a touch more balanced than the hallertau mittelfrueh version , or at least the hops are more aggressive enough that it hides the chewy body a bit more . the simcoe hop character has a nice balance between sharper , herbaceous notes and softer , juicier fruity hop notes ; for those that like a good balance between this hop character , this hop can do it on its own . i usually prefer a bit more focus on the tropical fruit and citrus hop character in my ipas , but this is still quite tasty .

0.60 0.20 0.60 0.20 0.20	have you ever canned tomatoes ? if you have , you should be familiar with the smell and flavor tomatoes have when cooked . this beer had an overwhelmingly strong odor and taste of spicy stewed tomatoes . it was too strong to drink . i know this is not normal for this beer from the other reviews of it i have read ( and the style does n't allow for many strong flavors ) , but it was only days past the best by date and had been stored in a refrigerator . it should have still been good . there was also some floating particles in the beer which i also assume is not normal , pilsners typically being filtered . i will come back and rerate , but i 've been told by some fellow raters that i should take this beer into account for my rating .

0.80 0.50 0.70 0.40 0.30	a : comes in short bottle . has a nice clear golden yellow color to it with a nice fomey head that leaves a nice laceing s : slight grass like smell and the rest oranges but not that strong t : the first sip was horrible but after that i could taste orange peal and wheat m : smooth not to light with good carbonation d : kind of hard to be drinkable when the taste is so off . would never buy agian im glad it was part of a beer of the mounth club and i didnt have a whole case

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	pours a light golden color with a thin lacy foam . aroma has a lot of maltiness with hint of hops . has a sweet bread taste with a bitter hop finish . not as balanced as i would have liked . for my tastes , it could have used a little more hop spice or perhaps a little less sweetness . but overall , very enjoyable and very quaffable . the malty sweetness pairs well with fruits and dishes prepared with tomato sauce .

0.80 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.60	pours a nice gold with a thin white head and lots of bubbles cascading up the glass . smells of citrus/grapefruit/pine hops with some malty sweetness . taste is a letdown after the wonderful smell . not as much hop character as i 'd like in an ipa . a bitter piney resin lingers on the tongue at the end , but there is also a malt sweetness in the middle . beer has good carbonation , but mouthfeel is too light almost watery . not a bad beer , but not one of the top ipa 's either . i 'd like to have it on draft sometime to see if the hop profile is better fresh .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70	i bought a single bottle at capone 's restaurant in norristown , pa. and poured it into a pint glass . appearance : a deep brown body with a tight tan head about two or three fingers in hight , produced thin lacing at the top but little to zero at the bottom and middle , decent retention . smell : overwhelmingly boozy at first , combinded with roasted fruits , nothing really stood out to me . taste : of course there were raisins throughout the entire brew , but over all it was very sweet . mouthfeel : incredibly smooth . drinkabiltiy : pretty darn good , but only if your in a sipping mood . do n't drink and review .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80	thanks harry ! pours a deepened sandy orange , head only off the hard pours . blurry . some vinous , sticky hops - not a fresh , lively sensation like other ipa 's . holy wow ! resiny texture from the hops comes out most in the mouthfeel . a glinging , hop soaked mouthfeel that coats the roof of your mouth with oily hop texture . a bit of a surprise considering the ( i hate to say it but ) meak aroma . a substancial bitterness on the finish . some malty notes but not much flavour apart from the oily , resiny hop mouthfeel . the elonged and delayed bitterness is quite the trick ! drinkability is quite fair , there is nothing overwhelming to comprimise this one . good character .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.60	they say that euthopia brews beer..some colour and head and sourness . a stout ? light mouthfeel , particularly for this style . some hershey chocolate syrup carmel malts and coffee roast for flavour . quaffable . radekfest 05 sample 34 , i think run in by oakes .

0.60 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.50	pours gold with a quickly fading head . aroma is very grassy with grainy malt in the background . not good ! flavours are the same with the addition of some metallic hints which continue through the mild finish . body is stupidly water and unsurprisingly the carbonation is pretty high .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	sampled the nugget , amarillo , chinook , tomahawk , simcoe , kent goldings , and warrior side-by-side . all draught pours at max 's in baltimore on 4/22/2010 . a- all have a very similar appearance . all with some form of a thin off-white head and some touches of lacing . the chinook exhibited a more diffuse head . the body was a cloudy copper color , with no visible carbonation . s- initially , not much of an aroma ... most likely due to them being served cold . with the chinook , you 're getting a pale and vienna malt base on the nose , along with a comparatively faint hop aroma . this seemingly neutral nose may have to do with the serving temperature . very balanced nose overall . t- on the palate , it 's nice and balanced . just a touch of fruity esters over the pale/vienna malt base . the hops come across pleasantly earthy and herbal . the finish is very dry , and the hop bitterness lingers earthy and herbal . m- thin to medium in body . highly attenuated with a soft carbonation . not bad ... not great . d- balanced . approachable . almost quaffable . definitely my favorite out of the single hop series .

0.90 0.50 1.00 0.80 1.00	poured from a chilled 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass pours a red-mahogany color with a nice billowy pinkish-tan head forming on top to about 2 fingers . fairly hazy to look through ... not too much light peering through . a sweet , floral hops hits my nose . lots of sugar on the aroma . a bit of a `` funky '' smell as well that is a bit sour , but i ca n't dispell what that may be . sipping reveals a big hops flavor that is both fairly bitter , but smooth , not too piney . fairly bitter up front but sweetens up as it goes down with a bit of alcohol coming through . interesting to say the least . good floral aftertaste . yum ! very smooth ale . unbelievable actually . carbonation is so well balanced it 's silly ! great bottle of brew i picked up for $ 5.50 ... ca n't do much better than that . wish i had 2 bottles !

0.60 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60	a- a clear , dark reddish brown . thin head , little to no lacing . s- not much in the smell department . a little bit of a roasted malt smell . t- toasted , roasty malts , bready and kind of nutty . but tasted a little stale . if what i 've picked up from pasteurized beers is correct , i 'd say it tastes like that , though i 'm not sure if warsteiner pasteurizes their exports . m- very crisp , but leaves the mouth coated with a sticky sweetness . not very impressed . d- pretty average .

0.80 1.00 1.00 0.90 0.80	a 2007 bottle a : pours a cloudy ruby/brown color . a two finger beige head forms and recedes after a few moments . some sticky lace is left behind . s : dark fruits invade the nose on first pop of the cork . bananas , plums , raisins . sweet malt and a bread/biscuit aroma . some yeast and a rum like alcohol . this is amazing . t : sweet malt and lots of dark fruit that follow the nose . cinnamon spice . bread and yeast . kind of tannin like . plenty of alcohol . m/d : a full body that is creamy and velvety smooth . there is plenty of alcohol , even after almost two years . though it is a good beer to sip on . this is a great beer . a beer to savor every drop of . highly recommended , and something for the cold winter months .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	thanks to my dad for picking some of this up without me knowing for a few days . a pours dark brown with a 2 finger heat thats just slightly brown . head turns foamy and has great retention . above the black body is tons of lacing around the glass . s real big roasty malt with a sweeter coffee bean scent . some hints of dark chocolate round out the scent and this is really nice . subtle hop scent . t nice roasty sweet malts with some coffee and bakers chocolate . not too sweet or overpowering but well balanced . m honestly its way too light of a mouthfeel . the heavier side of light thats somewhat watery with a medium carbonation feel . big time downer on what is a great beer everywhere else . o definately a great porter . great overall except the mouthfeel . this would probably be great a little colder and thicker .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	dark brown , with a frothy little head . the nose is all ashtray and coffee . i love it . the taste is bitter , cold coffee and tons of oatmeal . filling . a hearty beer with satisfying aftertaste of creamy espresso . this is breakfeast beer alright , and if i did n't have a job , it would replace my coffee .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	75 cl bottle with foil , cage , and faux-cork presentation . bottled 2/14/2007 . pours a dark and cloudy deep red . rose colored head is huge then settles down quickly with a loud fizzing hiss , leaving a ring of foam along glass rim . the nose on this is enormous , loaded with raspberries , dry sourness , and a twist of acetic oaked funkhouse . really highlights the fruit and maintains a balanced lambic background . tastes of tart raspberries that pack a highly acidic sour punch . lemon juice , lightly musky funk . throat scorchingly dry finish with a hint of garlic ( yes , i just wrote that ) . lots of fruit , lots of sour , and very dry . very nice beer , though i 'm not necessarily convinced it is superior to the oude kriek . medium body and a wonderfully sprtizy carbonation keeps it light and makes the tartness manageable . good stuff , probably the most sour of the 3f beers i have had . difficult to come by , and personally i would buy a couple bottles of the oude kriek to drink instead of going out of my way to find another bottle of this . delicious though . cheers !

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	bottle shared by lunch . thanks paul ! the beer appears a very dark shade of brown . there is about a half inch of head atop the beer that leaves some decent lacing on the glass . the aroma is very enticing , with scents of rich , roasted malt and a nice sweetness . i thought this beer was great , and was pleasantly surprised with how much i enjoyed it . the mouthfeel is my favorite aspect of this beer . the beer is rich and thick , and totally coats the palate . i would really like to have some bottles of this delicious beer in my cellar .

0.90 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass . a : color is a nice copper-amber color . pours with a nice one-inch head , slightly off-white in color . decent lacing as the head slowly dissipates . s : sweetness hits first , candy and caramel . then the hops come in with a nice piney and citrus bite . this has potential . t : so much for the hops . an overwhelming sweetness hits you hard up front . more candy flavors , dark caramal , big malts . mid taste , a hop bitterness makes a re-appearance , although much less than in the smell . finish is odd , very grainy with a lot of peppercorn . almost a little tinny . and then the heat kicks . wow , this has got some warmth for a 9 % strong ale . m : medium body , low to medium carbonation . smooth and creamy . d : something does n't quite work for me . there was a lot of potential up front , but i found myself liking this less and less as a i drank it . i really marked this done on taste , specifically the finish . interesting , but i would n't hunt this down again .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.40	lightly chilled bottle into a glass . a : pours a pitch black body with 2 fingers of dark mocha head capping the brew . retention is great -- even a bit frustrating . my hands are shaking . must have craft now . ca n't wait for head to die . s : this is very interesting . it 's not pungent , but it has a grainer , more hazelnut-dominated bent than most imperial stouts ( which tend to be chocolate or roast-dominated ) . those latter flavors are there , but in more balance than expected . coffe , of course . i also pick up a slight mintiness that is odd , but somehow pleasant . t : while this is n't particularly hoppy per se , it 's definitely hop-defined . the chocolate , coffee/roast , and grain flavors are complemented by a grassy , minty flavor that produces the effect of a lightly minted coffee . it 's pretty tantalizing . m : quite smooth ; it 's easy to guess that oats went into the brew , and they contribute a lot to the mouthfeel . thin in viscosity , light-medium in flavor . it 's a relatively dry stout . it 's unfortunately watery in the finish , at times . d : i thought it was decent , but not something i 'd pay $ 12 to pick up . i prefer the beer geek brunch weasel , though that 's also a financial challenge at $ 16 a pop .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70	pours a light amber color with a good amount of head , leaves a decent ring of lacing . smell is rather weak , difficult in making out any aroma besides some malt . taste has a decent malt backbone , slight bitterness in the aftertaste , smooth and creamy texture with a good amount of carbonation , the buttery slickness is the best thing about this beer .

0.40 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.70	not much to look at in the glass , like ginger ale ... no head . cooking spices in the nose , pepper and coriander . surprisingly crisp , refreshing taste . the wheat gives it a sweetness to balance the spices . very refreshing in the mouth , its best quality . being so light-bodied , you would enjoy this ( or several of these ) on a warm , sunny day . not a great beet , but an easy to drink beer .

0.60 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.70	was quite excited about sampling a few beers from the mildura brewery , had heard alot about it , knew the guy who set it up , etc . got this and 2 others from their brewery from my mum and dad , and a 570ml glass . sampled in the 40+c heat of new years day down under . poured into the tall pilsner type glass , pale amber in colour , did start with a dense 1cm head , but now has about 5mm instead . working well , bubbles rising like crazy . aroma : a faint whisp of hops , a bit of malt , possibly a german coloured variety . not much really , maybe it 's too cold . i 'll wait and smell again . taste : hello ? flavour ? where are you ? a slight malt , a slight hint of caramel or crystal , and a slight lingering bitterness . a twang of yeastiness in the back palate ? biting carbonation , was that a hint of roastiness ? drinks ok , for a lager . with the name like `` mallee bull heavy '' , i was expecting a malty , punchy scottish ale . not a ninny . i 'm not really impressed , the bottle mentions `` chocolate notes '' and a `` soft and delicate hop character '' , nothing there says `` heavy '' to me . anyways , ok , but not a winner for me .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80	thanks to dankbeer619 's aunt for bringing this home for him and thanks to him for sharing . a - pours a slightly hazy reddish dark brown with a big fluffy tannish lingering head . lots of lacing . s - sweet caramel malts with bready and toasty smells as well . moderate fruity esters - makes the beer a little too fruity smelling . earthy hops . f/m - light bready malts , toasty , caramel . light roast . moderately high fruity esters . medium bodied with a slightly thin feel . dry clean finish . d - good drinkabilty , a little bit clean and refreshing , for a dark beer . but the fruity esters and light feel make this beera bit lacking for this style .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	clear , black with a nice tan head with excellent retention and lacing . aroma is sharp with bright , acidic espresso , burnt malts , oak , and cocoa . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body . expertly balanced hop flavor and bitterness . watery and accesible with mild malts . a good introductory stout ... smooth and easy to drink but lacking in body .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	bottle at lakewood winking lizard . pours black with a nice beige head . aroma is chocolate , roast , vanilla and has a lot of woody tannins . has a faint fruit thing as well . flavor is roast chocolate , vanilla and wood with almost zero alcohol . fairly bitter from the chocolate and hops . palate is full and it is quite smooth . great beer from troegs ... i expected it to be an average beer at best .

0.40 0.40 0.40 0.70 0.60	i would like to thank aimstatus for purchasing and sharing this most sought after imperial stout . poured from a 22 oz . bomber ( like water ) into a bruery tulip . a : poured just like coca-cola ; dark brown , fizzy , with a head that lasted momentarily . oh yeah , no lacing either . does n't exhibit any qualities , other than the color black , that i usually associated with a stout . s : smells like grandma 's funky fruit cake ... with extra pepper . seriously ! this is most likely due to overly done coffee punch added to this beer . if this was n't enough , there was a strong alcohol smell at the tail end as well . t : after taking a few minutes to mull over the flavor profile , i was surprised to find several aspects of this beer not to be appalling ... especially after getting over the aroma characteristics i found earlier . these aspects included a more subtle coffee than expected , some more dark fruits , and mild chocolate malt notes . m : thin and overly dry . d : i do n't know what to say ... could barely finish my 11 oz . pour . the flavor is n't bad , not great , but is basically the only thing going for it . overall : extremely overpriced and wish i had purchased that bomber of bourbon county when i had the chance . hell ... i should have picked up a four-pack of old rasputin and saved close to $ 10 bucks . i would n't say avoid this beer , but if it were priced at $ 7 dollars ( instead of $ 15 ) ... .i 'd still probably recommend another imperial stout to try . a below average beer for this particluar style . cheers !

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.70	750ml bottle via trade thanks to the extremely generous deuane on beeradvocate . yeah , harrisburg ! shared with a small tasting group . well , the cork took some real effort to get out . reminiscent of some lost abbey bottles i 've had in the past . not usually a good sign . as expected , it pours a pretty much flat cloudy red color . no head . really nice nose on this beer . it has mad elf 's prominent cherry notes and winter spices . a little tartness comes through , as well as considerable barrel notes : oak , vanilla , and bourbon . i 'm not the biggest fan of mad elf , so i was interested to see how the flavors on this one would change . as i had hoped , the barrel-aging worked quite well . the sweetness has been muted a bit and replaced with very subtle tartness . sweet/tart cherries , oak , spice , vanilla , and very subtle bourbon . medium-full bodied with almost no carbonation . dammit , with a few more bubbles this could be a great beer ! bummer about the lack of carbonation , but overall it 's a well-done beer besides that . others did n't want much of it , but i enjoyed the considerable amount i had .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.50	pours out a surprising jet black with two fingers of tan head . hey its a black barleywine ! lacing is impressive . it looks like i am drinking fbs . smell is fusel alchohol right away . hey its a big fresh barleywine , i guess i should expect it to be hot . subsides into beautiful pineapple and mango scents . taste is big impressive pineapple hops up front ! amazing unique hop profile big pineapple flavor . pineapple pineapple pineapple then some roasted malt that is delicious and becomes more prominent as it warms . finishes hot and boozy not enough to be a huge flavor issue . mouthfeel is lovelty big smooth , substantial , with just enough carbonation . much win here . drinkability isnt great a big time sipper even witthout being hot and boozy . one is enough . also - water : wicked witch = nemesis : your teeth 's enamel .

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.60	drank this one a while back , never added the review ... taken from my notes . a . very light yellow color , thin foam , no retention . s. very little on the nose . t. tastes is there , flavor is better and more present than it looks and smells . leaves me looking for a little more though . decent mouthfeel . d. as i said , was looking for a little more in terms of flavor . overall its rather drinkable and would enjoy a couple of these on a summer or warm fall evening .

0.60 0.50 0.20 0.30 0.30	shared by dsc ... served in tulips ... the first sip was awful . but it gets better ... slightly ... a very murky beer -- reddish brown in color . small tan head . spots of lacing ... meh . the smell is insanely sweet . wow . sour cherries ... vinegar ... the taste is only slightly better -- huge sweetness , vinegar , sour cherries , and a mustiness that i ca n't place ... the sourness is intense -- but the sweetness trumps it ! this beer is waaay too sweet . this is like cough syrup with some sourness.. the body is undercarbonated ... it is syrupy . not something i like , overall -- this is one i could skip the next time around ... it is n't terrible , but is does n't wow me in any aspect . i am sorely disappointed in this beet .

0.60 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	pours copper with a small head . nose shows fruity and floral hops ( lots of orange ) along with slightly toasty malt and hints of coconut . very sweet , later on some spicy cloves show . similar flavours with lots more orange peel . some soft alcohol shows , merging with the sweetness . carbonation is distractingly high .

0.90 0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80	this brew surprised me a lot . i 've now had the 2009 version in the bottle and on tap at least two times each . to be honest , i 'm not sure if there 's much of a difference as both versions are very good ! this review is of a fresh 2009 bottle . it pours a rich , dark , typical , stout-color with good , long-lasting head . the aroma blows me away with its hops . if i had smelled this with my eyes closed , i would have sworn the delicious , hoppy , citrus/lemon aroma was coming from an ipa or dipa . i 'm really digging it . the taste has just as much of that citrus/lemon character , if not more . however , there 's a nice , non-overpowering , chocolaty stout character mixed in with the flavor as well . even though this is such a dark , rich , brew , it seems to lean more toward a dipa than an imperial stout . the hops are mostly in the aroma and flavor , but there 's a decent bitterness as well . the dark stout characteristics are certainly evident , but they almost take a backseat to the hops . oddly , the stout qualities seem on the light-side for such a big imperial stout . the mouthfeel is a tad lighter than i would have expected . the combination of dark malts and potent flavor/aroma hops is a very interesting mix . i have n't always liked that pairing in other dark/hoppy brews . i still think a huge hop aroma/flavor works best with some sort of ipa or barleywine , but this smuttynose brew might prove otherwise . this is certainly not your typical imperial stout , but i 'm really liking it . i 've had some other highly-rated hoppy imperial stouts , brown ipas , dark ipas , etc . from across the states , but this is my favorite of the bunch so far . in the end , this one hits me more like some sort of dark-dipa than an imperial stout . whatever the case , if you love hops ( and even if you 're not a big fan of dark beers ) , you need to try this brew . ps - do n't age this brew . drink it fresh to take full advantage of the hops the brewer put into it . an aged version of this brew would surely be less-interesting when compared to how it tastes when it 's fresh .

0.50 0.30 0.20 0.30 0.40	a - three fingers worth of crisp , foamy , slightly rocky pure white head ... audibly fizzy ... fades to about a half fingers worth before displaying some retention and then fades to a feel even lacing with a slightly thicker collar ... a very pale straw yellow color ... mostly still with stray small bubbled exceedingly flow carbonation ... s - not much at all in terms of aroma ... it 's a struggle to pick up much ... cereal ... corn ... slightly musky ... perhaps some wet grass ... a touch of lemon ... t - fresh corn ... bland cereal ... a touch of sweet lemon ... not much else ... a struggle to m - gone before you know it ... light bodied ... no real carbonation ... very little to rate in this category ... d - the appearance is slightly disappointing and this one only proceeds to go down hill from there ... i could drink a couple of these in the proper setting , but as you would imagine this is not one i would ever seek out or recommend ... there are far superior light and adjunct lagers ...

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70	12oz bottle poured into a perfect pint . i was kind of interested to try this beer as one of the first craft beers i really started drinking and enjoyed was magic hat # 9 . outside of that i never really tried anything else from magic hat , so i picked up a bottle of this for something different . a - pours a very light yellow color . for a beer that says its unfiltered and the hefeweizen , i am not getting much wheat sediment in the bottle or glass even after a quick swirl before pouring . a very little head that evaporates quickly . the head really repels the glass and there 's no lacing to be seen . s - smell is light , but not very full . most of the nose consists of yeasty breadiness and slight lemons and oranges . but overall , the bouquet is extremely faint . not much else to comment on in this regard . t - much like the nose , this beer does n't have the most poignant of flavors . while there 's nothing wrong with it , it 's just a bit lifeless and forgettable . wheaty . kind of reminiscent of miller high life ( and i have quite a few experiences with this as a penn state boy ) . a bit disappointing . slight hint of lemons in the aftertaste . m - light bodied and well carbonated . feels good in the mouth . d - while this beer is n't amazing , i can see it being refreshing on a hot summer day and getting through a 6-pack pretty easily . not an amazing representation of the style and the bland taste really bring this one down .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	single bottle from famous wines in lombard , il . a : pours dark brown with perhaps a slight reddish tint and just off-white/very light khaki colored head that laces the glass nicely . s : smells of molasses , nuttiness , brown sugar , some vanilla , oak , caramel malts t : very similar flavors as the smell , with a bit of bourbon esque bite . nuttiness , brown sugar , molasses , slight vanilla and oak and of course caramel malts m : this is one of the best brown ales in terms of mouthfeel as i 've had ( although i have n't had many browns ) . nice and creamy with a good amount of small bubble smooth carbonation . d : very drinkable as the flavor is nice , but that little bit of bourbon flavor and bite might keep someone from downing a ton of this ... only a slight deduction there .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60	served on draught into 20cl stemware at the mikkeller bar in copenhagen . cost was 35 dkk . reviewed from notes . a : fair cream and thickness , but bad retention . colour is a dark orange-gold . sm : cream , butterscotch , caramelized malt , and barley . a mild strength aroma . t : caramelized malt , barley , and hops . maybe some butterscotch . complex enough , pretty balanced , and decently built . mf : smooth and wet . complements the flavours of the body . dr : fairly high abv with very easy drinkability . the price is rather high , but then i got it in denmark .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.60	750 ml bottled september 2009 . *i once enjoyed this beer in my early days of craft but i am now getting a chance to review it . i realize now i enjoyed it only because its easy to drink a lot for a quick buzz . one of the most hideous beers i have ever looked at . after popping the cork i saw a terrible display of yeast that does not look appetizing at all . it does however have a nice thick head that stays . smells like clove , mixed spices , lemon and bananas . uggh . tastes very spicy and clovey and all around not that good . there is some belgian yeast but it is masked by whatever the hell was added to this beer . the carbonation is pretty nice and feels great except for the fact that it shoots the yeast up . i have no idea what was up with this . overall , this is a fairly drinkable beer for its percent . i personally do not recommend having more than one because too many is a bad hangover waiting to happen , trust me . it is a nice beer for the inexperienced drinker but one i do not plan to touch again .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.50 0.70	i needed to buy some relatively cheap beer , and i figured that i should try this . i poured it into a pint glass and was presented with a very foamy ( with unusually large bubbles ) head and a dark golden appearance . this looked better than a typical macro . the aroma is unusually sweet , and it did n't smell like anything i 've ever tried before . when i sipped it , i was surprised by a citrus-fruit-like taste and a little tartness that was nothing like anything i 've ever tasted . with the smooth , slightly oily mouthfeel and low carbonation coupled with the citrus zest , it was evident that there was a party in my mouth . it finished clean , with no aftertaste . overall , it is an okay brew . the citrusy taste is refreshing on a hot day , but it almost does n't taste like a beer . i should have picked up some blue moon instead ...

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	a- a pleasantly orange-golden color , slightly cloudy , not much lacing or head retention . s- great smelling beer , plenty of hop aroma , citrus seems to dominate the nose and the rye comes through nicely . t- the citrusy hops are well balanced with the rye and other malts . slight grapefruit taste on the back-end . m- seems a little thin , but nicely carbonated . d- very drinkable beer that has given me a new appreciation for rye beers . i would certainly try this one again .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80	bottle # 85 waxed , crown capped and corked 750ml . 10/2006 cloudy golden color with a big white head . looks great . smells like i expect . belgian esters and citrus . sweet and creamy . a touch of oj . very well balanced . immediate finish is n't quite as dry as i expect , but it has a very long finish which dries out 30 seconds or so after you swallow . damn tasty . lots of co2 turns the well attenuated body into creamy goodness . fantastic mouthfeel . 8 % . a sipper , but wonderfully refreshing . great sip after sip . i will not have a problem with this 750 . great american saison . very clean yeast profile . i would like more barnyard flavors . best i have had since hennepin . certainly the best i have had on the west coast .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	lighlty hoppy nose with a pretty good amount of butterscotch-y diacetyl . pretty fruity yest effects too . the light hops is pretty wierd for an ipa . orange colored with very , very little head . and it 's kind of cloudy . wow , really bitter . citrus hops . i mean really , really bitter . am i actually chewing on lemon pith ? i do get a little malt around mid-pint but it is so faint under all the bittering oils . this is a classic example of tossing a s***load of bittering hops in the kettle and hoping for the best . medium bodied with a creamy carbonation level . this is a tough one . there are hop freaks out there who do n't like balance . i 'm not one of them .

0.90 0.90 0.80 0.50 0.40	krampus is an imperial helles lager that does not look like a helles , does not smell like a helles , and it definately does not drink like a helles . pours a slightly hazy copper color with a small white head that has good retention . large amounts of spotty lacing is left behind . well hopped up aroma . pine and floral hop aroma with a little medicinal qualities sums things up . the hops dominate the flavor as well . resinous and medicinal qualities with very little malt profile makes this extremely unbalanced . extreme bitterness like that is found in a dipa . the alcohol is well masked . has a medium body which is needed to carry all the hops and alcohol . low carbonation lends a nice texture without letting the flavors being cloying . another beer i do n't get . does not have any characteristic of a helles lager where everything is in balance . the american hop bill does not make me think of munich . tone the hops down a bit and allow the malt to come out and you might be onto something . maybe use mt . hood hops instead of willamette as well . i found it difficult to drink this 650ml bottle .

0.50 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60	pulled one of these out of the fridge at my grandmother 's house the other day and jotted some quick notes down on a post-it note . figured i should type in my review before the notes faded too much . i 'd never heard of this beer before . appeared a pale bronze straw color with a light fizzy head that left no lace . the aroma was thin , slightly malty , with some faint fruit esthers . maybe a hint of strawberry here . the taste was also thin and malty . i detected a hint of apple flavoring , but otherwise it was fairly underwhelming . not bad , but not good either . very watery . the mouthfeel was thin and watery as well . on the whole , i 'd give this beer low marks on everything , but i would n't mind having this one on-hand after a long , hot day in the sun . would be a great beer to take down the river on a tubing trip ( if you could take bottles ) or on a fishing expedition . a very serious lawnmower beer , but not a connoiseur 's companion .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80	a : very light straw color , with little head . no lacing nor retention . good carbonation bubbles . s : sweet blueberries , yet not overpowering . somewhat grainy also . t : perfect amount of blueberries . sweet , but not cloying . did n't really taste like a pale ale or a wheat beer . odd taste but refreshing . m : thin and watery and too carbonated . d : light , refreshing and unique . easy to drink . decent beer .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	pours with a foamy head and a cloudy pale amber colour . the smell was average - i could n't notice anything special . it had a smooth mouthfeel with a little carbonation . at first it seemed like it had a sweet grape flavour ( many said it had a banana flavour but i could n't taste it ) but halfway through it started to taste bland and was hard to finish . overall i think it 's pretty average .

0.70 0.60 0.60 0.20 0.20	poured into an english pint glass . really looking forward to this . i 've been in baltimore for almost four years now and have n't been to brewer 's art until tonight . 3.5 a : dark as night but really clear . not a whole lot of head , but maybe that was the bartender 's fault . not too much lacing either . still , not bad . 3.0 s : strong coffee aroma . dark crystal malts . bready . 1.0 t : this was the worst tasting beer i 've ever had in my life . i was hoping that it would magically turn into a natty boh or a schafer . some aspects were really good . strong coffee and dark chocolate backbone , but then came the horrible , awful taste of spoiled wine . i had trouble driving it into me . 3.0 m : medium body . smooth , but not creamy . 1.0 d : the taste destroys any hope of drinkability . there is no way in hell this is a belgian beer . it 's a standard ( though awful ) american stout .

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.50	tasted from bottle purchased at binny 's lincoln park . pours a muddy brown-orange with an average white head that recedes to decent lace . nose of nutty brown sugar with some funk and a smell similar to rye bread . flavor is caramel with some toastiness , light funk , moderate sour flavors , and nuttiness . body is medium with average carbonation and a short sour and nutty finish .

0.80 1.00 0.60 1.00 0.90	this stuff is fantastic ! ! poured black into my glass with a tiny amount of light penetrating the edges with a dark ruby / copper colour . no head to speak of but a light ring of tan coloured lace about the edges of the glass . the smell is incredible . sweet , chocolate , coffee , roasted malt , and perhaps a tiny bit of stewed or candied fruit hiding in the back . these same qualities are present in the taste , as well . very little hops ; enormous malt . quite similar to a mackeson 's xxx . the mouthfeel has a little bit more carbonation than i would like a brew of this calibre to have , thus the 3.0 . everything else about this one is fantastic at least .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	crude oil coffee with the guts of earthworm . super super dark brown , earth coffee earth and more earth . then on the palate , thick , maybe thickest beer ever . taking coffee beer to not only the next level but another dimension . liked the other 2 kopi beers much more , this was just such an odd ball , again earth and coffee . crazy .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.80	thanks to shrek806 for the trade . a-pours creamy out of the bottle , an amber-orange color with a slight haze ... .kind of an in-between haze . one finger thick head , leaves a lace on the glass that persists throughout the entire glass . pretty decent looking eng ipa . have n't seen one this color before . s- obvious hops on the nose . very floral with hints of tropical fruits . underneath the hops is a very impressive mix of yeast and sugar . the smell also has a bite on it , either from carbonation or alcohol . kind of reminds me of smelling the corn fermentation tanks at jack daniels . mmmm . t- again , the hops , floral first ( rose/gardenia ) with a hint of apricots/peaches . a smooth maltiness finishes this off . pretty standard . good , but not best in show . m- big fan of the mouthfeel on this one . it 's medium to full bodied . very creamy . i 'd kind to like to see what this is like with nitrogen . there 's a little bite on this which is very pleasing . d- this is a very drinkable brew . i was very tempted to crack into a second one , but decided to let it hang out for a few more days . overall , i enjoyed this beer . it was tasty and in it 's own way unique . i 'm glad to have tried it , but i wo n't deliberately trade for it again , but would pick some up if it made its way to store down here .

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70	appearance : straw color , touch of haze . full of carbonation . small head that disappears . aroma : crisp and clean . slight grainy and spicy hops . taste : clean malts along with crisp spicy hops . sweet grainy malts , cereal , a little grassy . hop is crisp , im getting spicy notes . body is light , yet very crisp . medium carbonation . finish : crisp and clean finish . slight grainy aftertaste . overall : just your basic pilsner/lager beer .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60	12 oz bottle , date 17-jul-2009 a - pours a light golden color - more on the dark side of the gold spectrum . lots of bubbling going on . also very clear - no haze . head is slow to form , and is n't very substantial . leaves a light film . s - not strong - a combination of spicy notes such as yeast and coriander . sweet smelling . apparently loaded with alcohol based on the phenolic scent . t - initial flavors are light , mostly a combination of the malt sweetness and yeast . mid-stream reveals some bitterness . finishes with a sweet smooth sugar and malt flavor . lots of sweetness to this beer . a spicy aftertaste is leftbehind . m - the sugar base of this beer makes it feel like syrup - loaded down with unfermentables . carbonation is n't overly present in the mouthfeel . d - this beer is not very sessionable by me . simply because the abv in this beer is deceiving , and it does weigh you down a little bit . not particularly against the style as this is probably common in tripels . 150 in the books . woo .

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.90 0.80	got this at de bierkoning in amsterdam . into a pint glass . appearance : pours a 1 finger medium-thick off-white head with good retention . color is a nice crimson red , clear , with quite a bit of carbonation . head slowly fades to a good cap . some film remains and leaves some lacing down the glass . good for the style for sure . smell : caramel malt and toffee and some hints of dark drapes and prunes . a touch of flower hop as well . relatively mild . taste : taste is much bolder . caramel malt and toffee with hints of dark grapes and spices . some flowery hops and quite a bit of spicy alcohol and hop bitterness at the finish . strong and long lasting aftertaste has a spicy alcohol finish and plenty of earthiness and bitter hops . quite nice . sweetness up front and nice bitterness at the end . very enjoyable and well balanced . palate : medium body and higher end carbonation . semi-creamy on the palate , goes down with a bit of a scratch and finishes slightly dry on the palate . could be smoother , but alright . overall : very enjoyable strong ale . alcohol is very present given the modest abv , but that plays well in the enjoyable taste profile . enjoyable and drinkable , one i 'll certainly visit again . recommended .

0.60 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.70	bought at humperdinks on nw highway in dallas . served in an ice cold glass , the beer so cold it had ice crystals floating on top . appearance : light straw color , fair head . aroma : faint sweet malt aroma . flavor : sweet grainy malt flavor , with only a faint bitterness . clean , simple finish . mouthfeel : i 'm docking them here for serving the beer at ridiculously cold levels . they brewed , they should know how to serve it . otherwise , light , thin body . easy , simple drinking beer . might be better at a decent temperature .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90	( 2005 vintage , 3 years old ) poured into a goblet it does n't produce much of a head at all ... on my second pour even after shaking the bottle a bit i only could get maybe half an inch of a lightly browned head that did n't last long . some strings of lace . has a ruby peach tea color . smells slightly sherry-like ... currant , a little bit of alcohol and sweet caramel malt actually accompanies the smell , which made me think there would be a bevy of caramel malt when tasting , but is misleading . hits the mouth with salt ... yes salt and pepper ... spicy hop ... not grapefruit , not piney , not even earthy just peppery spice is created by the alcohol and hop profile . it is immediately followed by a light raisin , liiight caramel malt , and buttery oiliness is left on the lips . the moutfeel is great in this beer , which is n't usually something you can rave about but this is just interesting because while all the flavors are light the mouthfeel is actually quite an experience . again starts off peppery tingly followed by a juicy malt and dark fruitiness and finishes with a tea leaf-like dryness on the tongue , but you can lick your lips to find a buttery oiliness . i think this beer is great ; most great beers in my book have 5 or so moderate to bold noticeable flavors intermingling ; this however , has multiple light characteristics dancing around and deserves thought , and maybe even solitude . drinks quickly and leaves you feeling good , alcohol is not too noticeable except in maybe the smell or the mouthfeel but certainly do not taste ethanol even with such light characteristics in this beer .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	2007 vintage , on tap at the rattle n hum and served in a tall , thin glass . stone irs pours a solid and complete black , with a small bit of tan foam serving as a cap on the beer . there 's also a bit of lacing down the sides of the glass . the nose is incredible , a near perfect blend of rich chocolate , sweet , dark fruits , and a touch of tobacco . that great balance is lost in the flavor thought as the herbal taste of tobacco , and a bit of wet cardboard oxidation become a bit too prominent in the flavor blend . milk chocolate as well as plums and figs and the like are still present , but a bit more subdued . there 's also an unexpected but welcome espresso flourish to close things out . the mouthfeel is porbably the low point of this beer , as the body is too thin , and crosses the line into watery . at the same time , the beer is a bit undercarbonated . i 've had experiences with less aged versions of stone irs in the past that i enjoyed a little bit more than this one , 2007 's batch may have already peaked .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	a - pours like oil out of the bottle with a finger , mocha head - dark , rich , and sexy , per the bottle s - very sweet , milk chocolate - very sweet with a little bit of roasted malt t - the taste pretty much follows the nose . it is very sweet and milk chocolately at first , which is then followed by a subtle burnt malt . pretty good . m - kind of watery , but good carbonation . smooth and goes down nicely . d - i really enjoyed this porter . not saying that this is a bad-tasting porter in any but i tend to like a little bit more roastedness in my porters and stouts , though . i will definitely purchase this again ...

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.80 0.80	a - amerber colored with a nice head but little lacing s- clean and crisp with a strong smell of the vanilla t- tastes less like beer than beer should -- tastes like vanilla bourbon almost , no bad but not like beer m - very little carbonation and a nice drying effect on the mouth d - at 10 % you would n't know if -- thankfully thr price prevents you from buying too much of it i 'd buy it again .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.60	650 ml bottle served at 65 f. a-as black as strong coffee maybe even darker . a nice dark tan head coats the glass as i sip . s-a lot of different smells going on . i smell marshmallow at first followed by dark chocolate and a distict raw meat smell that i pickup up in a lot of stouts . maybe its the roasted malts . all in all a pleasing scent . t-this has a flat cola taste to it followed by unpleasent bitterness to me . there is a big coffee presence followed by a little bit of sweetness . i must say i dont like the bitterness of this beer . its like very burnt toast . i wish the sweetness was kicked up a notch or the bitterness was toned down a bit to make it more balanced . m.f.-its not as thick as you would expect but it has a nice creaminess to it that is easy going down . i would say the carbonation is perfect . drink-this is a wonderfully crafted beer by 3f but as with most of there products it is a bit on the bitter side . which lately i have grown tired of the overabundance of hops used in beer lately . a year ago i probably would have given this beer a better score . but right now i dont think i would buy this again . i must say though that this style is very similar to a bourbon barrel porter at half the costs . similar tastes and textures going on .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.60	a : really nice lookin orange body with an offwhite head that leaves above average lacing . s : grassy , herbal hops and a metallic/plastic twinge to it . t : more of that offputting plastic aspect . this tastes exactly like when you were a kid and you would squirt those cheap plastic squirtguns in your mouth after the water had sat in it for a few hours in the hot summer sun . the hops are there , but are too earthy for an american ipa . m : good mouthfeel . medium bodied . d : low in alcohol , but the negative taste aspects detracts from the drinkability . i could burn through a six-pack of this , but i would n't necessarily enjoy it .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.20 0.20	had to re-review this beer due to the huge difference i have found since the original review . that six pack i bought last year must have been a fluke . i have purchased this beer twice since the original review out of the refrigerated cooler at the winery/brewery and both times it was just nasty . sour , cidery , and undrinkable . if they can't/wo n't due any qc at their own store , what makes them think that the bottles they now distribute are going to be in any better shape ? what really sucks is that this is a fine beer on tap - i had a sample at their tasting bar and it was just like what i reviewed below . 6/20/04 i do n't know if they tweeked the recipe since bierman9 's review but i thought this was one of the most unique and tasty lagers i 've had that was made in the us . the color was quite a bit darker than i expected , almost an amber color . the best part of this beer was the noble hop nose character that was full and in your face . nice moderate mouthfeel and slightly fruity and nutty flavors gave way to a substantial hop bitterness and the end . a truly great lager that was way fresher than any german lager you can buy here in the states .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.50 0.50	this is # 2 and it was brewed on 05.22.02 . today is 04.17.08 so it 's been almost 6 years in the bottle . it opened with a hiss and poured with a decent 1 '' head that subsided into a robust skim . i have lace on the side of my goblet that descends from nearly the top of the glass . it looks well made . it does n't have much of a smell . it tastes originally tart and slightly vegetal . i 'm put off by this . i had vegetables for supper . my concern seems to be going away by the middle of the glass . the smell is becoming more vegetal , but the flavor is getting sweet . this slight unpleasantry may be me . the beer is getting sour . i think it has taken a turn for the bad . i 'm not ready to pour it out . i 'm walking around now and the booziness of this beer is breathing with me . i pour more ( it 's a bomber ) and it 's starting to sour again . i recall this when fresh and this sourness and vegginess was n't part of the beer then . i do n't think it aged well . the pepperiness is coming out toward the last half . it presents quite alot of flavor . unfortunately , some are not very tasty to me . i think it 's past its time . ok ... i just read the reviews and it seems that this batch ( 02 ) is problematic . it seems that some of the lowest scores of this beer come from this batch . i have 01 in the cellar . i 'm going to try to forget this one and when that is accomplished open 01 .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.60	pours a clear light amber color , lighter than i am used to . a small amount of carbonation creates a very thin white head . smell falls as flat as the appearance . a bit of caramel malt smell , but a flat malt smell . taste falls a little flat as well . a bit of the caramel malt comes through , but kind of a dirty malt taste . mouthfeel is okay . there is a good refreshing crispness to it , but not what i usually like when it comes to an octoberfest . drinkability is okay on this beer . not very strong , so one could drink them fairly well . however , one would n't want to . not worth going out of your way for .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	a : in keeping with it 's name , this poured a deep red with a creamy head . s : mild hops and not much else . t : hops , which was pretty strong . m : thin , moderate carbonation . d : there was n't much to this beer , although the flavor that was there was n't bad . this was nice with food but on it 's own , i 'm not sure i would have enjoyed it as much .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.80 1.00	a= the beer pours a nice looking light amber orange color with a small finger of head on it that holds nice retention and lacing on it . maybe a little light in color . s= fruity smelling . i 've been drinking a ton of furious lately and this is soooo much fruitier . mango and pineapple come through mostly with less of a `` bitter '' hop profile . not much pine but there is a little ripe grapefruit in it . t= the taste is again in the fruity hop category . tastes candy like actually . totally different spectrum than most bitter bombs i 've had lately . this is n't nearly as bitter as most ipas . great mango and grapefruit flavor . actually tastes a lot like biting into a nice ripe grapefruit . m= this is the biggest problem for this beer . the mouth is super thin . the thinnest mouth i 've ever had on an ipa . d= the thin mouth makes me go for sips more often and the flavor does n't linger long ... great flavor on this one no doubt . a tasty brew indeed . worth seeking out and is on a totally different end of the spectrum from a bitter bomb so i would prolly buy this regularly if it were avalible to me .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.80 0.80	fairly luxurious head over a deep mahogany very grainy pilsner malt aroma . lovely floral hops . dry , roasted smells very subtle palette of flavors : excellent hop presence , toffee malt , narrow range of yeasty fruitiness . some tartness and a distinct nutty flavor ( partly hop flavor , partly roasting ) . mouthfeel is weak i would say the hop contributions are beyond what is called for in a dubbel . but who , in the end , really gives a damn ... as long as the beer is good , right ? ( i will admit that i judge more harshly against off-style beers that are average or less )

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	on tap at the rhino in missoula , where the tap made the name out to look like `` ipa ~2 '' , as in `` ipa squared '' . this beer appears a slightly hazy medium golden amber hue , with one finger of light foamy off-white head , which renders a thin solid wall of lace around the glass as it fades away . it smells of creamy caramel malt , and orange/grapefruit citrus hops . the taste is the aforementioned citrus hops up front , a latent dose of toffee malt , and a somewhat medicinal alcohol warming . the carbonation is moderate , the body full , creamy , and smooth , and it finishes with a warm , floral fruitiness . a decently ( but not exactly exponentially ) hopped-up ipa - however , the booze needs to be better integrated , to aid in the overall enjoyment factor .

0.90 1.00 0.70 0.90 0.90	a : pitch black with a two-toned brown and tan head . good retention and prominent lacing . s : roast interacts with chocolate interacts with oak interacts with vanilla . the combination comes across as a milk chocolate-ly smell with some woodyness . t : flavor starts full of oak . good smoke flavor . moves into a bitter roast . sort of a black coffee-like flavor . vanilla isnt as prominent on the palate , but the smokiness from the oak is very welcomed ! m : gentle fizz on a medium full body . if there was a slightly more silken mouthfeel i think it would make this brew that much more enjoyable . d : great complexity between the wood and vanilla . just nice to have some other flavors worked into your standard roast , chocolate , sweet stout flavors . very enjoyable and unique american stout .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	this was the first belgian i ever had . the appearance threw me off a little b/c of the cloudy orangish color and texture . i was n't sure if i would like it , but i loved it . i have come back to this beer time and again . it has a very creamy smoothness that i really love . the taste is of tropical fruity sweetness and some spicy alcohol . finishes long and dry with more fruityness . a great introduction to the world of belgians for me !

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.50	heron ale begins with a nose that is simultaneously sweet and sour : brown sugars and light fruit esters ( apple , pear ) are countered by a tart hop and citrus aroma , the latter sporting more plant-vine notes that i normally expect . on the tongue , the beer carries the same bipolar identity , the malts coming across in waves of brown sugar and toast with light fruit esters , but the hops providing a bitterness not normally present in hoppy brews , being somewhere between grapefruit rind and fresh grass , or perhaps rose petals . this bitterness is not a turnoff , however ; it makes the beer quite intriguing , and the sugars are just tuned enough to prevent the bitterness from being overwhelming . having said that , late in the mouthful the sugars do die off , and the hops take even more of a center stage . here is where the bitterness reaches a peak that i suspect might drive off some , especially those unfamiliar with the esb style . this bitterness lasts well into the aftertaste , which lingers for the better part of a minute . mouthfeel is light , and carbonation is medium-light . overall , while i again suspect the brew 's bitterness may prove unpalatable for some , i thought the beer good . not great -- this is the weakest of the nashoba beers i 've tried -- but good .

0.70 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.50	while i 'm generally willing to totally crap on and dismiss light adjunct lagers , i 'm surprised and somewhat amused that i do n't hate this beer . disclosure : the last time i purchased light lager , american , adjunct , or otherwise , was probably when i lived in central america and had little other choice than the various country versions of euro light lager . part of why i like this beer okay is that it reminds me a lot of those beers , only better . i only purchased it this time because we had a friend of a friend coming over to the house who i had been clearly told only likes light thin fizzy beers , and while i normally am willing to just tell them too bad , and offer them a mixed drink or wine , i had a nightmarish vision of him grudgingly pounding my ( much more expensive ) victory storm king and not appreciating it . i try really hard to review and rate beers subject to their style , and so am rating based on that : 12 ounce can , $ 3.99 for a six pack at trader joe 's , a screaming deal for a 6.2 % beer that is at least drinkable . appearance : medium bright yellow , with a moderate off-white head that fades quickly . a more attractive color than many of its competitors in this category , so better than average . smell : damp grain , some light but sweetish corn , some fruit , but pretty limited aroma overall . i do n't get the sulfury or dms notes that some others mention ( i wonder if sometimes you go looking for something , and then you 're more likely to find it . ) taste : sweetish american lager , with notes of corn and some faintly sweet fruit that i ca n't put my finger on . lingers for a while , which is a little bit of a surprise . maybe a little bit of grass . again , not by any means my favorite style , but better than most of its category competition . still , overall , just not that tasty , so not something i could rate above 3.0 mouth : distinct carbonation , slightly fizzy , and a little viscous ( a bit of a surprise . ) enough carbonation and alcohol to make it slightly tingly , but not hot . probably the best thing about it . drinkability : even though i 'll likely never buy it again , even for drinking after bicycling in hotlanta , it 's surprisingly drinkable for what is probably my least favorite style . still , i consider this rating `` do i want to buy it and drink it '' , and i do n't . interesting that if i were judging this using bjcp categories 1a or 1b , `` strong flavors are a fault '' , and i would probably dink it a little for that .

0.80 0.90 0.70 1.00 0.90	a perfectly executed coffee stout . pours a deep coffee brown , with a half-finger tan head . smell is mostly coffee and roasted malt . flavor is exquisite , a wonderful balance of powerful coffee and stout flavors - coffee up front , followed by rich roasted malts , with a touch of hoppy bitterness in the finish . the really amazing thing is that the flavor is strong and complex , but incredibly balanced . mouthfeel is a tad light for a stout . this is simply a fantastic beer .

0.30 0.30 0.20 0.30 0.50	pours a nasty looking straw yellow color with a thick soapy white head and almost no lacing to speak of . smells of corn and grain and a big waste of time and money . mouthfeel is less than average and is too thin to be worth a damn . drinkability is poor as well . another poor bmc beer .

0.50 0.50 0.70 0.40 0.50	22oz brown bomber with no freshness date . look : hazed orange amber smell : sweet-tart , toasted grain , very biscuity , bready , floral , fruity taste : smooth , slick , medium body , fermentation twang , toasty , biscuity , husky , dust malt , herbal , spicy , yeasty a ridiculously narrow style ( marzen ) when it comes to guidelines , first thing i always look for is if the beer is clean or not . second is the malt profile and hops are last but not least . unfortunately for blue hills this is not clean , the malt profile is way out of whack and the hops are lost . perhaps they meant to go down this road but it is not the road of a true marzen .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	i was in leavenworth and ordered this beer . i swear they poured me the wrong beer because it tasted more like a red . ( could have been that i had too many previous beers too : ) ) so i tried it again the next night , and found it to be enjoyable , but not what i look for in a good hef . my biggest qualm with this particular beer is the mouthfeel , too light and too much carbonation . i like a hef to be nice and thick and smooth . it was almost like drinking a hef light , good taste but i usually drink a hefeweizen for the smoothness .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	had this with the mustard beer chicken at the brew pub in san jose . looks good in the glass , with a very dark brown color and lots of lacing on the glass . taste is a bit light for a porter , with heavily roasted malt and a noticeable coffee note . like the ironwood dark , the carbonation was too aggressive , detracting from the overall drinkability of the brew .

0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.40	paid $ 12.99 for a 12 pack from bevmo in willow glen , ca . poured into a pint glass . 3/4 inch light tan head after an aggressive pour . head quickly settled . immediately noted heavy on the carbonation . an interesting hue of dark amber . spotty lacing . well balanced aroma with hints of malt , alcohol , hops , sweet caramel and even a bit of spice . flavor is not as complex . malty caramel flavors in front , a bitter finish . after a few sips , the higher alcohol content becomes more apparent . heavier bodied , smooth , not as carbonated as i would have thought . average drinkability .

0.40 1.00 0.40 0.60 0.60	i forgot about this one for a while . pours sludgy and brown without a single damn bubble . this beer has serious legs . smells incredible , so rich and deep . oakey apple brandy , burnt sugar , vanilla , raisin , tobacco , leather . the taste is the same , but just too damn much of everything , including alcohol . not overpowering , but just a bit much . there seems to be a competition to see which flavor can sting my tongue the most . definitely a sipping beer , as even a small gulp burns my throat and numbs my lips . carbonation probably would have done this beer wonders , but it is just barely there . and that is why i wish i had n't traded something awesome for it . now i 'm going to drink a cigar city ba milk porter by myself and forget about it . literally .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	mucho thanks to gclarkage for the sample ! at room temperature , this pours out very dark brown , nearly black and has a crimson cast when held to light . a creamy 2 finger head puffs up and retains nicely . spotty lace . aroma is milder than expected with strong chocolate notes accented by leather , scorched caramel , black malts , and subtle coffee . fortunately the flavor is much more pronounced , highlighting creamy chocolate as the main attraction . there are nuances of caramel , molasses , dry leather , creamed coffee , and a just-right nip of hops in the finish . medium bodied that feels larger due to the silky smooth mouthfeel and mouth-coating texture . carbonation is soft and slippery . deliciously drinkable . why this beer only scores an 85 is beyond me .

0.60 0.40 0.40 0.60 0.60	beer served with lime wedge . very average apperance , very golden hue and transparent . no head or lace with tiny bubbles . it has a very overwhelming lime aroma , smells sour and yeasty . the taste is very refreshing , sweet with the lime taste . it has a somewhat watery mouthfeel . i find this a slightly better corona but a good summer beer . if i tried this again i would like it without the lime because i found it overpowering .

0.80 0.60 0.30 0.50 0.60	bottle courtesy of ss : poured a bright pale golden color ale with a huge white foamy head with perfect retention and good lacing . aroma of sweet malt is kind of cloying and more or less enjoyable . taste is also dominated by sweet sugary malt which is kind of gross with a weird oily texture and light yeasty finish . average body with some good carbonation . definitely not the best beer from this usually fine brewery and not something that i am eager to try again and almost makes me want to suggest to the brewery to stay away from belgian ale and keep doing the ipa/iipa and is .

0.60 0.40 0.20 0.20 0.40	mister beer is pretty damn crappy . had some the other day as some cheap bastard could n't pitch in an extra buck or two to get schlitz . oy , what a mistake . the first sip flashed me back to playing a game of `` pass-out '' with this stuff where we all had to induce vomitting to drink more . ah ... to be 18 and stupid again . wait ... i just was by drinking it . this is a last resort drink .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	appearance : pours a peachy orange . smell : fruity sweet and acidic with peach and yeast . taste : starts acidic with a bit of apricot and vanilla with a peach-orangecycle character . finishes clean . mouthfeel : exceptionally smooth and silky as can be . drinkability : my wife and i liked this . we had it at the end of dinner and before our creme burley . hope this is helpful . cheers !

0.50 0.70 0.80 0.30 0.60	poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass at cellar temperature . a : poured a cola-like head that dissipated nearly immediately , leaving a light ring around the glass . very dark brown , but not quite black , and transparent against the light . the color is correct for the style , but the lack of any head is a shame . s : roasted grain predominates in the nose , with a hint of coffee and cocoa . t : the flavor is at first a nice roastiness , leading into an almost lemony sourness that is seriously out of place , and which ends up dominating . there 's a slight hint of buttery vanilla , just noticeable on the fade . m : the mouthfeel is quite light , and presents as a session beer . fermentation is present but not aggressive or distracting . d : the relative lightness of the beer would lend to treating it as a session beer , but again the odd sourness probably limits most people to one of these at a sitting . overall : i am again disappointed with the most recent offering from this local small brewery that i really want to like . open fermented porter sounds so promising ! the funk , though , manifests itself as a rather weird citrusy presence that just seems out of place for this style .

0.90 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.80	a : clear bright straw with a large white head that has great retention and very nice lacing . s : husky and grassy with a bit of lemon . t : grassy and saazy with a bit of malt sweetness in the background as well as some lemony flavors . m : medium body but the finish is not as crisp nor as clean as it could be . d : easy drinker that has the taste that is very true to style just a tad to heavy to be as refreshing as others .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	ap- this beer actually looks pretty damn good sititing in the glass . a light amber color with nice head ( inch or so ) that holds on to retention fairly well . leaves good lacing on the glass too . ar- the beer starts to go downhill from here . smells of malt and lager yeast . smells sweet and grainy . t- sweet roasted like malts hit you up front and then the lager yeast towards the end . not the best finish to a beer . m- thin and watery and lots of carbonation o- depends on how you look at it . it is n't even close to as good as most craft brews . but when you compare it to the bmcs of the world , it ai n't so bad .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	12oz bottle of fresh winter 2010 `` loch down '' . a : a good deep brown to black body with slight red hues around the edges . head holds well and lace is almost non-existing . s : a nice example of the classic elements , but a strange chalky note . good bit of intensity . t/m : the front is a watery and almost vacant sensation until a sweetness of the body hits and throws in a bit of a caramel , barley note . mouthfeel is a bit thin and too smooth . finish is short and on the low intensity side of things . d : does not really have me running back for more , even so the rest of the beer was a bit off thinking about the false and empty front on this beer . element all a bit short on this one .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	poured a dull , very light brownish gold . very transparent . it had no head , oddly . it smelled fruity with hop sharpness to it . the first thing that hits me is its high carbonation , followed by a sharp bitterness , followed by a dull bread flavour . it 's better than i was expecting considering that the packaging referred to it as being loaded with hops . it is certainly better than i remember it . this is one of the first beers i had that i considered hoppy . i hated it , saying that it tasted like a straight christmas tree . but i guess my palate has become more tolerating of hop use . i still think that it should be used only in moderation and only to subtly balance sweetness in some beer styles , but its use in this brew does n't really bother me much . i wo n't buy it again , but i am not repulsed by it . still not really anything special about this beer . it 's fairly lame all around .

0.90 0.80 0.80 0.60 0.40	poured from a 22 oz bottle , it pours the color of almond skin with a tan w/ a pinkish hue head about 1 finger thick . aroma is of a brown malt with maybe just a bit of roast & a slight beechwood aroma . interesting to say the least . a slight sweetness also hits my nose but hard to distiguish what it is ; maybe cherries . sipping leaves a little to be desired . i expected a bit of chewiness from this one for a bock , but it is very smooth . flavor is a bit watery brown malt with a hint of earthy hops & a bit of caramel on the finish . little carbonation hits my palate . fairly drinkable , but it misses the mark i think a bit for a christmas/holiday brew . not as warming as i think it seems to advertise .

0.80 0.60 0.20 0.20 0.20	remarkably , this beer has a good presentation to it . there 's at least two fingers thick of bright white head , with a light gold and clear body . this is what a pilsner is supposed to look like . the aroma is not anything to brag about , though . it is dominated by metallic aromas , and seems kind of skunky . the taste shares the kind of bastardization as well : very skunky and meaningless . it 's taste is worse than its smell . this is a horrible impression of a lager/pilsner . i do n't understand how this became a popular import . the germans do n't even drink this crap . if this beer tastes like this in its homeland , then the export version has to suck ultra royally . avoid this monstrosity !

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.40 0.90	this is an incredibly difficult review for me . on one hand i actually really like a lot of what this beverage has to offer , on the other i ca n't quite figure out how this fits into the spectra of beer ... a- pours a golden light orange , almost clear . nice 2 finger head but dissipates quickly , sone lacing s- the tart but synthetic essence of green apple jolly ranchers ( which i happen to love ) , cane sugar , with a barely noticeable yeasty and barnyard quality typical of lindemans lambics . this is where it becomes difficult and quite frankly frightening for me ... should a beer really smell like this ? it is inviting , yet so very wrong . t- no surprise here after initially stuffing my nose into the glass . atomic strength green apple . this stuff is more apple than apple , so to speak . really syrupy sweet . apple candy in a glass . finishes almost tart enough to balance it out , but sadly not quite . again , quite tasty , but wrong . i kind of feel like i 'm cheating on beer with this stuff . m- really good carbonation , low abv and the nearly great sweet/tart balance make it actually react quite nicely with the mouth . d- designed to be consumed en masse , despite mixed feelings about this stuff it goes down easy .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80	what can i really say about guinness that has n't been said before ? i was in ireland for a couple of days and had a great deal , both at the brewery and in every pub . i love the way it separates right after the pour and i love the creamy white head that remains as long as there is still beer in the glass . the aroma classic stout malt with roasty chocolate overtones . flavor is slightly roasty , not as much as many other stouts . the mouthfeel is a true hallmark of this beer . few can replicate the thick , creamy texture of a draught guinness . this makes for a very drinkable beer that delivers from start to finish . it 's easy to spend an entire night on this beer , which is surprising considering its density .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	interesting-looking 16 ounce dark-brown bottle . wish more american brewers would bottle their `` normal '' beers in this size ! the label indicates an abv of 6 % . moderate pour produced an immensely huge tan head ( mildly reverse-cascading ! ) , over an opaque black-ruby body . as the head tightens and reduces , it gets rocky and chunky , and the lacing sticks like paint to the glass . smell is caramel , chocolate , burnt sugar , malty malted malt , with some fig and raisins . hops ? there 's a slight peppery hint . taste is espresso , chocolate , burnt toast , biscuity malt , with a very dry bitter finish . mouthfeel is way more thin than the head and lacing made me think it would be . very quaffable . overall , a fascinating mix of doppelbock smell and lager mouthfeel . surprisingly good . cudos and thanks to shbobdb for hooking me up with this excellent midwestern brew . i had never even heard of it . oh , the joys of a blind trade !

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.60 0.80	on tap at jackie o 's into a tulip ... of the da variants this was one of my least favorite , interesting attempt but in reality i just do n't think the flavors work well together ... looks at da ... the aroma is strange with tea come across too strong , notes of chocolate , raisins and spices come ... the taste loses a lot of the tea but it is still present . while tolerable in the aroma this becomes pretty difficult to drink for me , notes of tea , vanilla , roasted coffee..

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	a : voluptuous chocolate colored head , atop a very black beer . s : a nice strong chocolate smell , followed by a bitter black licorice scent . there is definitely a candy like smell about this one . t : rich chocolate malt , with touches of fruit . the licorice flavor comes out in the finish alongside a strong earthy bitterness . the anise really adds a level of complexity that i do n't think could be achieved through the regular brewing process . perhaps not amazing , but certainly well executed and tasty . m : medium bodied , and creamy smooth . carbonation is a bit low though . o : overall quite tasty , something very interesting , and a good departure from the norm .

0.60 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.20	got this at the dallas gingerman . a : pours a decent looking dark red color , almost no head , and no lacing on the glass . nothing too special here . s : smell is a little molasses , toffee , roastiness , and some other unidentifiable sweet smell . i 'm not impressed , but do n't hate it either . t : i really disliked this one . way too bitter and the sweetness was there to `` balance '' it but it was n't balanced at all . it was really just gross . the roast was like burnt toast and i did n't enjoy this one at all . i paid for it , but i drank only about 20 % before the waitress took it away at my request . m : carbonation was a little light , could use more creaminess , but overall solid . d : i could n't finish it so i have to give this the lowest score possible . too heavy like a syrup , too much roast , too much sweetness , no balance here whatsoever . not recommended to anyone . the waitress seemed surprised but i just hated it .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	22oz bottle . gold with a big rocky white head that lasts until the end and leaves lots of chunky lace . a great looking beer , though that 's partly due to the fact that it 's a little over-carbonated , but that 's bottle conditioning for you . the aroma caught me a little off-guard . not the citrus and pine i was expecting , but lots of peaches vanilla along with some caramel . there is some grapefruit and spice , but they are buried in there . the flavor starts with some soft pale malt , balanced by a healthy and spicy bitterness . the hops are fruity with peaches , tangerines , pineapple , ans some grapefruit . lighter feel and dry in the mouth with a little too much carbonation . quite hoppy for a pale ale , and on the bitter side of balance , though very drinkable at the same time . i have n't had their ipa in a while , but i may like this better .

0.80 0.90 0.60 1.00 0.60	nice dark brown color with fantnaztic lacing ! smells choclotly with coffee . tastes even and thick with cocoa sweet caramel flavors continuing thru . good for its class this porter represents well , its much better than its younger brother . would drink again .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50	a- adequately clear straw color with a very thin yet strong head . s- very mellow bready aroma with light cidery notes . t- quite sweet and smooth while the breadyness is quite minimal . some fruity notes are evident at mid point to add a little interest . there 's little hops to speak of which is unfortunate as they would of added a much needed familiarity to this beer . the finish is clean with a mild fruity aftertaste . m- nice carbonation while retaining a good smoothness . d- well , unless i 'm diagnossed a celiac , i prolly wo n't buy again . although it did n't ring my bell , it 's pretty awesome considering what it is . my only advice would be to add some more hops to make the beer a little more `` familiar '' .

1.00 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	this winter 2007 vintage 22oz bomber pours jet black , dark as night , with a billowing super creamy coffee colored head . at first pour it had very little head but then it started to billow and climb the glass , ending up with a solid two fingers . even slower on the way back down , with incredible retention and awesome stick . this one looks amazing . smell is very pungent with huge chocolaty and coffee aromas , some caramel too . at first taste the first thing i notice is that this is crazy thick . wow , this is as full-bodied and creamy as they come . taste has strong dark chocolate and coffee flavors like the nose , and the sweetness is definitely there with some caramel joining the chocolate but its not overdone to the point of being syrupy . there 's some definite dark fruits in the taste as well , and it 's a little bit boozy . it has a little bit of a bite and odd flavor that hits right before the finish , where those dark fruits and alcohol come out , and that 's the only thing holding me back from a 4.5 or higher on taste . this brew is awesome , but at 12 % and as thick as it is it takes awhile to get through . but man is it good .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.50 0.40	i really had high hopes for this one . a : poured a gorgeous black with a sizeable head . s : mmm ... interesting . sweet , malty coffee goodness , with something i ca n't pin down . t : the first sip or three were quite enjoyable . malty sweetness , good coffee taste , and a milky , almost bailey's-esque taste in the background . but then the aftertaste kicked in . this beer would 've owned pretty hard if the aftertaste had not smacked of pennies . m : gorgoeus mouthfeel : thick , fluffy , chewy . in short , everything one could want from a stout . d : the pennies just killed it for me . i may try another bottle a ways down the road to see if this was a fluke/fault . sorry bell 's , not your best .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.90	2007 edition - big mistake to drink so soon pours an impenetrable black with a very thick , dark tan head that falls leaving very good lacing . the smell starts with a bit of alcohol that , sadly , overpowers anything else . the taste is also started off with alcohol then allows for some coffee & chocolate with a bitterness at the end . mouthfeel is thick and creamy , very nice . it 's most likely that this is way too fresh to drink yet . i wish that i had waited 6-8 months to try this . because of that , i 've adjusted my ratings numbers to average out the same as the overall average and will pick up another to hold to for a while and rate it again . i 've never noticed such a big diferrence in what i expect a beer will be and what i find due to what is likely just the difference in aging .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.50	pale amber/dark yellow , fine white head . nose of fresh green leafy hop , some pale malt notes . flavour of grainy malt . a bit bland for the style . body is a bit like soda water , and fades really fast . the beer starts with promise , but slips away once in the mouth .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	light chill haze in the golden color . modest head that reduces to a thin layer of bubbles . good lace , though . earthy but less so than some saisons . notable yeast bite , although the appearance would n't indicate it . strong level of fruitiness -- apricot , nectarine and pineapple . oily from the alcohol level . the hop , while present , is n't enough to give balance . rich liquid with moderate level of carbonation . there are some elements of a barley wine in the character , but the flavor is definitely saison .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.90	poured into a dogfish head beer glass . was very excited at the 104 ibus that this bottle boasts . almost no head , which surprised me . the best part of this beer is the aromatic hop fragrance- definitely nice pine , grapefruit , and citrus aromas there . but , sad to say that i was overall dissapointed in the lack of malt backbone , and lack of complexity to this one . i 'm not sure if the lack of flavor had to do with the fact that hop extracts were used intentionally , but i expected something more . between this title , and their everyday ipa , the only real difference in taste is with the aroma .

0.80 0.90 0.90 0.70 0.70	burnished orange sort of color , with an orange-tinted tan head . this is frothy and tall , but does n't leave more than a smattering of lace . super-spicy , plenty of `` dark '' notes like allspice and cinnamon , along with some pumpkin obviously . some alcohol noted as well . the alcohol is quite a bit stronger in the flavor ; basically everything is stronger , including the caramel malts , lots of nutmeg and allspice , and nice balance . some sugar , but nothing cloying . tastes a lot like a pumpkin pie . this is not my thing , but i think it 's a pretty good idea - to ramp up the usual fall seasonal . it 's nice and smooth and full , pretty impressive accomplishment even if i do n't love all the spicing . that 's not their fault but mine , so kudos to dfh ( again ) .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	i get a very rich smell of roasted malts that almost smell burnt in a way . i also get some soapiness ( not in a bad way ) and some subtle earthy hop character . the taste is all smooth rich and sweet caramel , toffee and bready malt which ends up melding with the slight flowery , floral hop that you can taste in victory 's hoppier beers . my favorite thing about this obviously the sweet rich malt character which adds to a very nice body for a beer of this alcohol content . i 'm also getting a slight nutty flavor mixing in with the sweet malts . i heard the brewer explain its a party beer because they made it sweet on the tongue which is something the brain says to wash away so you take another sip . in the end the hops round everything out and really balance out that roasted flavor . the malts really seem to be roasted closer to burnt but not really . it does add for a very autumn like beer . one of my favorites of the season . exceptionally well crafted .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60	22oz bottle into tulip pint . pours golden in color with a slight orange hue . it is fairly clear , except for some faint yeast particles floating throughout . has a foamy off white head with scattered clumps of larger bubbles . the nose is predominately of biscuity malt , with a light hop backing . the taste is again quite malty and bready , with very little hop note . has a nice medium to full body with light carbonation . while there was nothing unpleasant in this beer i felt the taste and smell were over-powered by the malts .

0.50 0.30 0.20 0.30 0.30	look : bright golden color , lots of bubbles and a foam finger head , fair lacing ; smell : concentrated pineapple and grains ; taste : bland and tasteless mineral water ; mouthfeel : watery , fizzy and very soft body ; drinkability : it 's assumed that is filtered in ice but tastes like mineral water only .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.70	pours a beautiful deep ruby more so than brown topped with a light tan head that fades to a nice even film that stays throughout the glass . a nice array of lacing lines the glass . i can detect some citric hops , but not much else . while the hops dominated the aroma , they 're less prominent in the flavor . their moderate bitterness is well-integrated with dark malts that add a fair coffee flavor to the beer . overall , however , i 'm not finding a ton going on . i ca n't help but feel it needs a touch of sweetness . i find the mouthfeel to be a bit too watery . i suppose the dark nature of the beer led me to expect something a little thicker . this is n't a bad sipping beer , but the generally weak flavor and thin mouthfeel do n't make for the most enjoyable session . though certainly glad i checked it out , i probably wo n't seek this one out again ; it 's a little to mild across the board for me to get too into .

0.90 0.60 0.20 0.20 0.20	i just finished dumping this awful brew down the sink - but in formality , here 's the rub ... er , the pour : appearance : poured like a dream - was really excited to drink this after the healthy pour that came out . huge frothy head , beautiful reddish gold hue . smell : meh , okay . not super noticeable . obviously a beer . taste/mouthfeel/drinkability : this is where it all went to hell . horrible contamination issues like the other poster to give this turd an f. tastes like sucking on a penny ... no , a roll full of pennies . i never toss beer i do n't like , but this one was bad - as in spoiled bad . they need to get their act together if they want to be a successful brewery .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	a : pours a dark brown almost black color . not much for a head , dissapates very quickly . not much for lacing either . looks very clear and filtered when held to the light . s : smells of malty caramel . maybe a slight hoppy aroma . t : typical for a black lager all the ingredients are there . coffee , toffee , caramel , i think i taste a hint of chocolate in the background . not bad at all . m : i was slightly disapointed here its not very crisp and could use more carbonation . taste sorta flat . as i have read from other ba 's this must be a typical description of the mouthfeel of this beer . one ba even described it as a `` flat coke '' . o : this is not a bad beer at all . however there is room for improvement . i 've had better and i 've had worse .

0.50 0.30 0.30 0.40 0.60	presentation : 12oz . brown bottle with no `` bottled on '' or `` best by '' date ; typically $ 5.99/6 pack . appearance : like most mass-produced american lagers , pours a ) crystal clear , b ) a fairly brilliant gold , c ) with a shortlived , snow-white head . aroma : faintly malty ; traces of cooked veggies . taste : lightly sweet upfront with notes of corn , grain and a flavor i think of as `` macro-skunk '' running throughout ; sallow hop-bitterness in the finish . crisp with a light-to-medium mouthfeel . notes : better than corona ? who cares .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90	i know some ba 's knock this onw because its not rare or amazing but i love it . if i am in a bar that i do n't think has a lot to choose from sam adams is the first word out of my mouth . its avalible as convenence stores and gas stations . its not too expensive and tastes good for what you pay . its also a great session beer . also we have a well known craft beer that i think is poised to give bmc a run for their money .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	appearance : black sludge . dark and ( very ) viscous . thin , extremely bubbly cappucino-brown head . the head disappears quickly , with no lacing . smell : heavy molasses , with notes of vanilla bean and mocha . alcohol floats around inconspicuously . taste : smooth coffee and vanilla . heavy and sweet . molasses/brown sugar sweetness floods the taste buds in the middle . the finish is equally heavy , tasting of tangy rum-raisin flavor and a gentle splash of hops . some oxidation spoils the fun a little towards the end . mouthfeel : this one 's thick as a milkshake . the carbonation leaves light smacks of bubbles on the tongue as the beer passes by , keeping it from feeling like motor oil . big , and very smooth . verdict : i ca n't understate the bulk of this brew . the mouthfeel is as good as it gets . it knocks some points off of drinkability , but i love a good , chewy stout . this one 's solid , with reasonable complexity and a pleasingly sweet personality . it 's not perfect , but stout lovers should seek it out .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.70 0.70	head was consistent when poured into a class from the bottle . stayed with the beer till the end . carmel flavors and overall very smooth . unique idea with the scotch whiskey malt ... it is noticeable in the scent and less so in the taste . i do enjoy the variety packs sam adams has been offering as of late , although this is not my favorite sam adams offering , it is solid .

0.60 0.70 0.70 0.50 0.40	bottled on 1/28/09 . served in a traditional german stange at fridge temperature . appearance- wow ... i know kolsches are pale in color but this really takes the cake ! a suggestion of light yellow/gold is all we 've got here ... the white crown fizzles quickly to just a thin , transparent mat . smell- zippy and bready , the malts outweigh the hops on the nose ... it 's like walking past a bakery at 5 in the morning . there 's really nothing much of anything else going on . taste- this one does n't hit the mark . it 's real lemony and hoppy , drying for sure ... but it 's also astringent to a fault . it 's not balanced at all regarding the hops and malt , but the aroma had me fooled . i 'm going to have to pass on this one . mouthfeel/drinkability- this beer blooms nicely in the mouth right from the outset , becoming full and frothy without going overboard or being *too* gassy . it 's light enough to session , but i just would n't go here again with the flavor profile not being so great .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	12 oz bottle poured into shaker pint . a : clear golden-amber with two fingers of frothy white head ; quickly subsides but nice looking while it lasts . s : good balance , a lot of citrus hops , particularly pineapple , are upfront . biscuity malts come through shortly thereafter , unfortunately they 're a bit mustier than would be totally pleasant , and there 's something in there that 's a bit similar to spilled beer at a football stadium . still , not a bad smell all around . less intensive sniffs , later into a beer drinking session , would probably have this around a 4.0 . t : hops are the first thing i pick up here , a lot of pine unlike the aroma , though some citrus is still bouncing around . hops overpower most of the sweetness that i was expecting from the malts , so instead they 're limited to contributing more of the biscuity flavor from the smell . i 'm surprised that this one is as bitter as it is ( in an enjoyable way ) for being just 4.6 % abv , though i 'd be cheating if i bumped its score up just for having a strong flavor at that level . m : medium-bodied with moderate carbonation , creamy and frothy on the way down . this beer goes quite a bit beyond its abv range , and is sticky enough to keep the flavor around for a while . o : average pale ale , though there 's certainly nothing wrong with it . for the price point , it 's still heavy on the flavor ( though in my opinion the mission st. ipa is several degrees better ) . pick it up if you 're at trader joe 's and are a fan of apas ; it 's easily worth the cost of admission .

0.50 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.80	bud ice , well what can you say other than look it 's a bud beer trying to have a different name pretty much . i think that this one is alright . not going to be what i reach for if i 'm going for the big 3 , but would n't say no if offered with no other options . i mean at the end of the day it 's still beer . it 's a light color , smells like nothing and tastes icy . it was ice cold thanks to the cooler and that made it tasty . watery but that 's alright because your not expecting anything but that from bud ice .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60	pours a clear orange/yellow color with plenty of carbonation and decent white head . smells very hoppy - the grassy kind rather than the fruity kind . this tastes disappointingly weak , watery and plain . there is n't as much of a hop kick as the smell would suggest . you get a sense of hops , but barely . the beer is almost flavorless . it has a below average mouthfeel - boring , too watery and macro-brewish . it 's not hard to drink and not terrible by any stretch . but i would n't buy it again , either .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	thanks to brewerb for this ! pours black with a brown head that becomes a wisp . a bit of lacing sticks . the smell is of chocolate , coffee , roasty with bourbon . the taste is of chocolate , coffee , bourbon - wow - this is tasty ! ( i think i might like the actual coffee and chocolate used in the other breakfast stout a bit more , but i 'm far from complaining ) . it has a great bourbon character to it , while allowing the dark complexities and roast to come through . does n't get too sweet , as there is roast and a dryness in the finish . silky smooth , it has just the right touch of carbonation to keep it full but not too thick or syrupy . awesome ! overhyped ? nope . very well-done - a great sipper !

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.30 0.40	poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass a -- light tan head , very thin , and lacey . reddish , walnut body s -- sweet malt , husky and light caramel smell t -- smokey malt , very sweet front , almost a mushroom like middle and a light hop end . m -- thick , slick d -- very one dimesional brew . it does n't taste `` bad '' in an off flavor sense but just seems to have a flavor that is non-distinctive .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.30 0.40	pours moderately cloudy gold ; i imagine this would be heady but i ca n't say for sure . now , let me get this out of the way early . i do n't like slamming beers . or at least , i do n't like slamming beers from good breweries . i want people to buy everything bell 's makes , even if it 's absolute shit , so that they 'll make more hopslam and sell it everywhere ( except for illinois , alas . ) but this beer is awful . the aroma and the taste are both nauseatingly estery , like a heavy-handed four year-old 's imitation of duvel . i never thought that a beer could have too many bananas in it , but this is that beer . malty sweetness is present as well , but it tastes like an afterthought . mouthfeel is decent if unremarkable -- medium-bodied , very slightly chewy -- typical for a belgian-style beer . every sip is an eternity of torment . sorry , larry , but this one did n't do it for me .

0.80 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.40	had this last night after work . poured a burgundy color with caramel head that faded quick and left good lacing . smelled of pumpkin , cinnamon , and mild hops . tasted of pumpkin , heavy toasted malt , and a hint of fruit . quite thick and creamy , though a little fizzy . a decent beer , though definitely an acquired taste . i would probably not have made it through another one .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.70	a doppelbock on cask seems kind of strange , but this doppel is different ; it contains little-to-no lager qualities , and scarcely any of the sweet , toffeeish flavors found in its german progenitors . lots of head from the cask pour , sitting atop a muddy , impenetrably brown beer . aroma gives some indication of the extreme maltage going on . it 's austere and heavy , with quite a generous chocolate flavor . the cask-conditioning imparts an unbelievable milkshake-y creaminess . this is almost like a stout without the hop bitterness , and i have to say it 's more comforting and satisfying than any rogue stout i have had recently . shakespeare i am talking about you . deal with it . i 'm glad `` brewer '' was resurrected after a number of years , and hopefully it will survive the limited anniversary line-up ; it certainly deserves to .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	i have been waiting to try this beer . people have been raving about it . very cool bottle with a very cool presentation . after breaking the paper and sliding the wire i hear a large pop . i am using a real alt glass ( .2l ) which is cool . pours out a reddish copper color with a good size head that lasts and lasts . the smell is malty with just a hint of hops in the background . caramel is mostly what i pick up . taste is not what i expected at all . much more clean but still full of flavor . sweet in the beginning but gives way to something a bit metallic . the ending has a nice hop bite . the flavors just seem to last and last in my mouth . i would love to try this beer from the cask . i truely hope to enjoy this beer some day in germany .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.70	poured from a 12 oz bottle into my lazy magnolia glass pours a clear , bright straw color with a decent head that leaves a little bit of lacing down the glass . the head does n't stick around for very long , and is very dispersed , but it 's a pretty acceptable look . smell is pretty one dimensional , with a grainy , corn husk malt scent hitting heavy and a slight sour , metallic finish . this is kind of odd the taste of this has a sort of pilsner-style bread thing going on , but without the clean finish . also , there 's a weird kind of fruit thing going on here , not what i expect out of most kolsch-style stuff . mouthfeel , however , is about what i expected , with a medium body . i could see myself drinking a few of these in the summer , but for the price one can do much better .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90	this is my second favorite of the session ales behind the southern brown . brownish copper in color with a moderate fluffy , sandy off white head . smell is a definite simcoe hop presence backed up with a dry grainy/bready presence with a nutty quality . taste is more of the same . balance balance balance is what this beer is all about . finishes very clean , but a piney , herbal hop character lingers for awhile and makes you want to go back for another sip . mouthfeel is pretty typical , and if anything is a little undercarbonated or slick . one of the most drinkable beers i 've had . this was really great after spending yesterday moving into a new apartment .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a standard pint look : pours a a very vibrant straw color with a large bright white head that leaves minimal lacing.. smell : the smell is very light and very refreshing . there is a certain sweetness to it that i find to be very inviting . taste : the malt character is very german which was highly enjoyable . there was also a small hop presence which really worked well with the malt . i was a little upset that the sweetness in the aroma did not carry over to the taste . mouthfeel : slightly heavy on the carbonation and slightly light on the body . just a tad bit unbalanced . drinkability : i really enjoy a few of these at a bbq or after an afternoon of yard work . very drinkable and refreshing

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.60	appearance : pours straw hazy with a huge white head that lasts a while . smell : citrusy smell . yeasty/bready aroma as well taste : spice dominates the flavor with some bread and yeast flavors . the yeast flavor combines well with the spices in this beer . very to style , just not my favorite style in the beer . tastes better than a hefe . mouthfeel : nothing special here drinkability : not a bad beer , but nothing special . would n't buy it again as i 'm not keen to the style .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	appearance : this brew pours a murky medium honey color . head is slight with minimal lacings . spiderwebbing was plentiful on the surface . interesting but not excellent . smell : the aroma is slightly matly with aromatic hops and a tart citrus presence . the overall aroma is rather light , expecially for an ipa . aroma curve is sharp during onset with a rather quick taper to sustain . taste : the flavor curve and character of this selection is quite interesting . initially there is a burst of hops that are accentuated by the carbonation . citrus and a woodsy presence with an interesting malt finish . great overall taste . mouthfeel : the brew has a nice carbonation snap upon initial sip . this highlights the flavor character . the totality of the flavor rolls off the tongue quite well . the palate is left perfectly clean after sustain . excellent overall mouthfeel . drinkability : this brew is not heavy in character and leaves the drinker wishing that there was another on ice . great . prosit ! nikki

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80	poured from a bottle into an american pint glass . very little head ; not much lacing , but nice amber color . the smell was very , very subtle but dominated by hints of malty sweetness ; maybe a little bit of sweet orange . the taste confirmed the sweetness , with only a subtle hint of hoppy flavor . silky smooth , medium body , but definitely a little alcoholic after-burn . i could certainly drink a few of these , but i would not consider it in the upper echelon for the style .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	appearance : cloudy burnt orange/brown - nice head retention smell : cinnamon , nutmeg , pumpkin spice taste : hops , cinnamon , coriander , nutmeg - similar to an american wild ale - very tannic mouthfeel : my favorite part very tannic , smooth - the rye dries the palate out so you 're ready for another sip or another bite of food . the hops add a nice bitterness . drinkability : sipper by far , this beer has a lot hidden within . a stellar beer from a growing beer company . i highly recommend .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	pours a nice cotton candy head . light cream tan , cappuccino in color . dark mahogany amber body . good carbonation . nice lace . smell is a very consistent rye . great malt character and light peppercorn on the nose . peppercorn seems to fade as it breathes . wonderful body . great feel . taste with a nice malt backbone . peppercorn is definitely prevalent warming indeed but not astringent hoppy pepperiness . smooth , robust , absolutely perfect with cajun food ... like soul mates . and seitan too .

0.70 0.60 1.00 1.00 0.90	poured from a bottle into a mug . batch # 1 . a deep reddish gold . just a bit of haziness . nice eggshell colored two finger head , which faded after a moderate amount of time leaving a very fine sudsy lacing . looking back now , the look of this beer nowhere near matches the taste . s fruit , yeast , and wood . i would describe the aroma as faint overall , with only the fruit aromas being at all prevalent . it didnt leave me thinking much was coming . i was wrong . t holy crap , i think my mouth just exploded ! pineapple , grapefruit , raisins , oak , maple syrup , date , toffee , caramel , honey , vanilla , sweet breads , cocoa , fig , and carrot cake . i just looked up the ingredients for carrot cake and pineapple and raisins were listed . go figure . boozy aftertaste . the 11.5 % abv is definitely not hidden in this bad boy . in fact , it slaps you in the face and calls you its bitch ! ! when it warms it can be a bit strong , but if you enjoy boozy beers this shouldnt be a problem . m prickly carbonation helps the beer almost literally dance all over the tongue . works well with the plethora of flavors that are going on here . slightly syrupy finish . o a completely unique brew . how sa packed this level of complexity in a golden-yellow package with minimal aroma can only be described as wizardry . taste-wise , this one is all over the place . which begs the question : is it any good ? i would say a resounding yes . i would gladly take a messy , unruly , uber complex beer over a one or two note boring one any day . i can tell you right now that this beer is not going to be for everyone . in fact , it probably wont be for nearly anyone , but it is for me and ill be snatching up every bottle i find . and i encourage beer lovers everywhere to sample one for themselves for a something truly different .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	draft at founders . dark as ever black/brown with a nice tan head . notes of chocolate and coffee in the nose . maple not that present . very smooth taste . good but really expected more out of his after hearing about it for so long . i wish i could have said this was the greatest beer i have ever had but i felt let down in the end . the look and mouthfeel were spot on though for me , it just fell a little short in the taste . draft at mackenzies for abr . poured a very dark brown color with a reddish tan head that quickly settles to a slight collar . the aroma is more coffee and leather than i remember with slight chocolate aromas as well . nice coffee taste with dark chocolate bitterness . again , i really do n't pick up major maple flavors at all although it has a pretty malty sweet taste although as it warms but you do get a slight maple aroma as it warms . medium mouthfeel , wish it was a little heavier . pretty drinkable . lingering bitter coffee flavor .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	pours a cloudy orange color with almost no head and does n't leave any lacing on the glass . the aroma is all hops - grassy and pine mostly . ca n't really detect any malts in the aroma . the flavor is very much the same as the aroma . completely hops that leave a bitter finish on the tongue , but i think they used a different type of hops for the flavor - it has a lot of grapefruit and citrus with just a little of the pine and grassiness . the body is moderate on this one and the drinkability depends on your liking of lots of hops . if you 're not a hop head , the drinkability will be poor . but it 's a good beer .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.50 0.60	appearance - wow , the first ounce or two gets completely converted to about four fingers of foam . getting a mug full of this beer will take some patience . ends up a nice caramel amber capped with a solid film of multi-colored foam ranging from light mocha to cocoa brown . aroma - yeasty , mild funk mixed with some sour lemon . hmm , i 'm undecided . taste - sour lemon , sweet , musty . a mix of flavors , some i like more than others . the finish is dry , tart , and sour . still not my favorite style . mouthfeel - lively carbonation with medium body , this beer has panache , that 's for sure . drinkability - i liked it less at first and more as i progressed . generally , this is n't a beer i 'd revisit , but it 's not bad , just not for me .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	beer pours a very dark cola color with a brown color head that is very thin and gives way quickly with very little lacing present . the smell is of coffee and roasted malt notes . the taste has a big coffee flavor with a slight hint of coco and a roasted malt backbone . the mouthfeel is a little thin and watery . overall it is a very drinkable beer , it has good flavor , and you could have a lot of these because it is not heavy .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	12oz . brown bottle with no freshness date . the label says to think of this beer as an octogenarian with a punk rock attitude . we 'll see . the beer pours a brilliantly clear and beautiful burnt amber color , but unfortunately i could n't get any head out of the pour at all . all i got was a thin white rim on top that left just a few spotty patches of lace on the glass . not much of an aroma , but what there was was nice . light sugary sweetness with some fruit and mild herbal hops in the background . this is a very well made and mild beer . it has both a caramel and hard candy sweetness to it but it is delicate and not overpowering at all . hop bitterness is low but you can still taste the mild herbal flavor they give off . a bready yeast flavor helps to make it more dry than sweet , and then at the end a touch of citrus and raisin flavor come through . nothing is really dominant , but all blended together it makes for a pleasant taste . very smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel with only moderate carbonation . this goes down easy without any trace of alcohol at all . i get the octogenarian part as this is a smooth and mellow beer , but i 'm not so sure it has a punk rock attitude . i found it totally pleasant without any harshness at all .

0.50 0.20 0.60 0.30 0.20	i used to have a collection of schultz and dooley steins back in the day . i never had the beer until tonight at an auction . clear golden yellow with no head to speak of . smelled of rotting steamed veggies . lucky for me , it did n't taste as bad . malty and corny . i ca n't stand it . i ca n't finish the whole thing .

0.70 0.70 0.30 0.30 0.40	purchased as part of `` build-your-own-six-pack '' at local grocer . poured little to no head on an amber body . smells were very sweet , malty , maple syrup , caramel and a touch of floral . sadly , those did not translate over to taste , which was dominated by a distinct unappealing dusty and skunkiness . overpowers anything else in there . also remarkably flat for the style . i 'm guessing that i got a bad bottle . i hope i did , as otherwise this is big disappointment .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	it 's almost time for this one to be coming out again . lucky for me , i 've got one left over from last year . 2007 vintage appearance : pours totally black into a duvel tulip . the head is small but dense at under a finger 's height . it drops to nearly a full surface covering . excellent retention . smell : not terribly intense , but coffee and roasted aromas are at the forefront here . light hints of caramel and a balancing hop aroma come out in the background as well as a slight twinge of alcohol . taste : coffee and caramel again , but covered in a thick , dark chocolate coating . it 's lightly fruity , but only barely , with a minor alcohol heat . not terribly complex but luxuriously delicious . mouthfeel : silky smooth with a thick body . the carbonation is on the lower end which smooths the beer out even more . awesome . drinkability : the mouthfeel is the star here , and not detecting most of the alcohol only helps . for such a big beer , it goes quick . a very nice offering , but sure to get lost in the shuffle of so many great imperial stouts . give it a try if you can .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.60	a : pours a clear amber with a tight , creamy off-white head that laces deep into the glass . the appearance is unique , as the head never seems to dissipate ; instead it remains perched atop the liquid . s : very light on the nose . aromas of toffee and caramel are joined by gentle suggestions of some kind of dark bread . not the most unique smelling beer in the world . t : this ale is initially sweet and very malty with gentle notes of caramel , toffee , cream , brown sugar , and vanilla bean . the finish is also on the sweet side with caramel and toffee flavors being most pronounced . there is virtually nothing in the way of noticeable hopping . m : really unappealing . most bitters and english pale ales have at least some carbonation , a bit of minerality on the palate , but this ale has none . instead , it is a very thin , oily , light-bodied beer . almost syrupy in some ways . o : tetley 's is a true disappointment . i have to wonder if its appeal is due to a degree of sentimentality , or whether it all boils down to availability . in any regard , i will not likely be drinking a can of this stuff again .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	best before february 2011 . 12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass . pours a beautiful copper color w/ nice white head and sticky lacing . smells like faint hops and crisp fruits . tastes just like it smells , subtle but complex . this is a bitter one ! malty too ! my favorite thing about this beer is the mouthfeel . very rich and creamy ; smooth . drinkabilty is ok , but one 's good for me . this is definitely an original . i have n't really seen any breweries attempt an imperial esb , so credit to heavy seas . good beer ; give this one a shot in the winter time .

0.60 0.40 0.20 0.30 0.40	this is beer for people who hate beer . its `` look at me i too can drink with the guys but i 'd rather be drinking a cosmo beer . '' this beer is most commonly consumed by cancun spring break goers . you know the ones . the same people who say , `` yea i 've been to mexico , '' but really they 've only been to fake mexico . they like to drink it with a slice of 'exotic lime fruit ' as they reminisce about the crazy nights they mixed this shit with one too many margaritas and ended up on girls gone wild . despite its popularity corona is nothing like beer in any of the above attributes other than appearance .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.50	[ best served in an english pint ] poured a medium amber in color with a super small white fizzy head and virtually had no lacing to speak of . the aroma was almost non-existent with a slight hint of bready malts and doughy yeast with just a very slight hint of caramel and some spice . it tasted slightly bitter with a very , very mild hint of spice in the beginning but the flavor faded quickly and left you with no real flavor at the finish . mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a flat carbonation . overall nothing special definitely a very light beer that is very light in flavor . which i find quite surprising coming from this brewer who puts out some of the best tasting beers in the world .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80	pours a dark coffee color with a huge nougat colored head that stays very well leaving a veil of lace . aroma is of sweet honey and cream , very sugary with a slight can smell . flavor is metallic with a peaty smoke flavor that rides on the huge dark roasted malt flavor . nice coffee and chocolate , but that metal twang sits on the tongue and is quite hard to explain . mouthfeel is thin and watery , no much body for the flavor going on .

0.60 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90	had on tap at the happy gnome during craft beer week . taken from notes a - pours the typical rich black though no head to speak of . not as beautiful as when poured from the bottle . s - nose is a nice balance of bourbon , chocolate and vanilla , though i was expecting more vanilla . not one over powering the other , great balance . t - bourbon and chocolate meld with the vanilla allowing a hint of coffee to peak thru towards the back . a touch of heat but again nice balance . the vanilla seems to bring out more chocolate and bourbon rather than a load of vanilla . very nice m - very low carbonation , almost flat . rich and sweet but it kept me going back for more . o - overall a great beer . not sure how this stands up to the coffee version which i loved but a solid bourbon beer for sure . i 'd love to grab a bottle at some point

0.50 0.70 0.60 0.30 0.30	poured chilled in flared glass . a : dark reddish copper ; flat head ; strong carb ; not much lacing s : strong raspberry aroma , very inviting ; occludes other smells t : expected sweet -- it is n't ; the raspberry dominates , but it 's quite sour , draped over a wheat-beer-like base ; i must confess , this tasted terrible to me ; it tasted like nothing else i 've had , so i do n't think this is something against the genre m : good carbonation redeems the experience a bit overall , a terrible beer , for me .

0.90 0.90 1.00 0.70 0.90	wow . so i have heard that this is a hopslam clone . not really , but very good . rich color , thick head . huge amount of citrus , hops , but not too malty and bitter on the finish . very smooth drink . highly drinkable . maybe not as full of flavor as i would like . the smell promises to lead into huge flavor , but comes up a tad short . either way , still a great beer . i would get this again and again . a double ipa you could drink a lot of .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90	picked up a 22 oz from hop city , poured into a 7 oz pilsner glass . a - pours thick and black with an insignificant head . appears nearly flat . s - strong coffee , with hints of malt and toasted nuts . t - coffee first , followed by dark fruits . if you let it linger on your tongue it leaves a very bitter aftertaste , but this bitterness is n't noticeable if you do n't let it linger . . m - much lighter than it appears with a medium body and lacks creaminess that would be expected from it 's appearance . d - appearance , smell , and initial taste were impressive , but personally i 'm disappointed by the bitterness in the finish . overall : i enjoyed this one time , but will not purchase it again .

0.30 0.30 0.60 0.30 0.30	this cask had not dropped bright or was a few days past where it should have been , my guess is that they put it out too early or the servers that placed the keg out rolled it out from the back and mixed all of the yeast back into the brew . full of yeast yeast in the aroma and flavour , just down right crappy cask what a disappointment .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.60 1.00	many thanks to alewatcher for sharing this after getting this growler in a trade ! a - slick golden yellow with a two finger white head and medium lacing . s - cinnamon , coriander and a little funk and tartness . not a ton going on here . t - cinnamon , allspice , anise and a mild funkyness to it . while the spices are nice , not a real depth of flavor here . the pumpkin is n't here at all . there was a noticeable oxidation taste going on here , but it could have been from the growler , so i wo n't count that against it . m - thin but creamy and the carbonation just pops - very nice . d - crispness and clean , wet finish make this a fast drinker .

0.80 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.50	huge , thick and billowy white head leaves an impressive trail down the glass . tartness and graininess are most discernible in aroma , but slight bubblegum esters are present as well . there 's also just a hint of citrus from the orange peel ( or orange oil extract ) the smooth mouthfeel and moderate body is not unlike that of a german hefeweizen . sugary sweetness dominates while honey flavors are mild but perceptible . finishes w/ a residual sweetness that borderlines on being cloying . this beer has both good attributes and bad ones . if it were more dry and there were hops to balance the sweetness this would be a very good american wheat .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.90	my first instinct is to compare this to guinness . i actually think the only difference is that guinness is a little more well known . it has the look you 'd expect from a nitro can irish stout . black with a creamy tan head . there is a strong coffee aroma and the taste is more chocolatey . at 4.0 % alcohol you would expect this to be a good session beer . well thanks to the creamy head the drinkability is spectacular which shows that this was intended to be a session beer . not the best stout , but if you can find it cheap than this is a great beer to take to parties ao you can enjoy it all night long when everyone else is drinking coors light .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.90	this is a damn good beer . this is the best of a very subtle and delicate style . pours to an impossibly clear yellow color , bejeweled by carbonation . has very thick effervescent white head that sticks around for quite some time , though it does n't lace too well . looks quite impressive , that is if you are n't offended by clear beer . the smell is quite wonderful as well . has a nice flowery , herbal hops bouqet . very clean . no esters , but a very light and fine malt aroma . has a bit of a vegetal lager aroma to it as well . the taste is good , as one would expect from the nose . very clean . no esters , only a very subtle dry pale and pilsener malt flavor . a very nice crisp floral hops bitterness provides most of the flavor . the body is very light , like drinking a carbonated water . the taste is very clean , washing the flavors away quickly . quite a drinkable beer for those who can truly appreciate subtlety .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	this one is a really good change up for me . i 've been all about ipa 's and doubles lately . this is a very nice malty brew with enough hop kick to keep me interested ! it pours darker than i anticipated ... almost exactly the same deep translucent brown color as one of those anchor christmas brews . the small beige head retains very well . after the pour the first thing i smell is the grainy , lightly toasted barley character that i find most often in home brews or small batch brewers . i like this a lot ... especially when that smell is backed up with an assertive barley taste ! hops are evident in the aftermath and they do a wonderful job of balancing out what might have been too cloying . it is a little bit sweet on the tongue . i could stand it to be a little bit more dry . but , the drinkability is fine indeed ! i highly recommend it ! cheers , mike

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	a : clear , somewhat pale golden in color . pours with almost no head . i left lots of sediment in the bottle . s : some sugary malts and sour cloves are the most noticeable smells . some alcohol and apple notes also . t : sweet apples and some sour cloves . has a very dry yeasty finish that leaves a lingering sour taste . does n't taste bad but it does seem off style . m : this beer is almost flat . d : this was the last bottle from a 6 pack i bought a year ago . i thought maybe a year would help , it did n't ( bottled sept. 06 ) . the worst offering from a great brewery imo .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	pours a maple syrup caramel with highlights of cherry wood . great amber resin clarity , almost gives this beer a syrupy look . very little head or foam after the pour , and even fewer bubbles . fruity , caramel covere appples and even a few nuts start the flavor profile . elegantly toasted malts meld with some herbal hops that give a rosey flavor . pretty warm alcohol gives the caramel and fruits more complexity . the palate is syrupy and warm , but not boozey . lots of fruits and som banana nut bread qualities . a sippable night cap beer .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60	standard copper pour , minimal head and chunkees . aroma was sweet and bitter . taste , was sweet and bitter as well . a feeling like the sweetness and bitterness from cherry lifesavers was in here , disappointing . did n't really get much of a hop feel out of it initially , began to meld halfway down , allowed some very weird flavors to branch out , i mean , there was that cherry , and then it allowed some pine and cinammon as if it was a christmas dipa . was definitely a little sticky , was able to appreciate more and more as it went on . this one really just suffers from lacking a hop flavor and dry hop nose . goes closer to a barleywine than i want my dipas . the immense bitterness takes awhile . give it to that one friend of yours who does n't really drink anything but extreme hopped beers .

0.40 0.50 0.30 0.50 0.50	poured a pale yellow with a light head that faded to lace quickly . aroma was slightly sweet and was of malts and grains - slighltly fruity as well . taste was unique - malt and corn with an interesting finish of light hoppiness . tasted like high life with an extra dash of corn just for good measure . that said , it was pleasantly different than other mass produced lagers in that corn flavor was not as bitter and unpleasant as many of them . palate was acceptable but nothing special . overall , not too bad for a cheaper pale lager .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	the first of four single cans i picked up a few weeks ago on a road trip . pours a ruby/copper color with a thin light tan head . noticeable rings of lacing . the smell is a piney hop aroma with some lighter citrus and brown sugar . it would have received a 4.0 if it was a bit stronger . smells good but you really have to work to get the scents . wow ... if i could canned beers like this in my neck of the woods i would always have them on hand . very flavorful with a dark caramel taste coming out first before the piney hops wake your mouth up . mouthfeel is a bit thin and the carbonation is too light in my opinion . slight bitter tingle on the tongue after swallowing and a light pine aftertaste . man , i really wish i could get this , sly fox , or dale 's in cans around here . this is a nice brew that i could easily hand out to friends ... if i did n't drink them all . it 's amazing how certain macro drinkers will drink anything out of a can and be happy and this would actually be a good tasting beer instead of swill .

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.70 0.80	i was not sure if this stuff was beer , but it says it is on the bottle . light honey colour.med carbonation , i am going to drink this out of the bottle but on the edge of the bottle are large clear bubbles . tastes like sweet soda water and lime with a unusual back ground flavour that is very pleasent.no hops that i can taste , very little malt . says on the bottle to drink ice cold , so i better hurry up.no after taste at all.if i was 18 and wanted to impress the boys with my stupidity i could easily put back a dozen of these in 5 min.its pop with a kick .

0.60 0.40 0.70 0.40 0.50	22 oz into falstaff goblet . a : nice golden color with the slightest haziness . head thats 1 finger completely disappears . no lacing . s & t : believe it or not this smells and kind of tastes like purple passion . the nasty shit i used to drink in jr. high that came in plastic 2 liter bottles . this is a weird malt beer . i do n't really recommend it . tastes kinda like chewing grape bubble yum whilst drinking coor 's light dudes . m : actually the high point of this beverage . light to medium body with medium to big carbonation . d : now this beer is n't terrible just strange . almost a liquorice beer . grape-flavored water beer dudes .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	500 ml bottle with the coolest cap i 've ever seen . `` century celebration bavarian lager '' , no discernable freshness date . i was surprised when i poured at how hazy it is ... looks like a wheat beer instead of a lager . nice big foamy head , and a potent aroma ... grainy , sweet , citrusy hops . tastes like it smells , highly carbonated , and very smooth . good stuff .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	this is one of my fav 's when it comes to mass produced beers from north america . the apperance was my favorite part of it . the color was a black color towards the top of the glass and then got lighter color as it descended . there was no head , but laced the top with a light film . the taste starts out a little bitter , but smooths out quickly . there was also some hints of fruits in it . not a bad brew overall .

0.20 0.50 0.60 0.20 0.20	just terrible . has an awful , mouth-burning sweetness , a very artificial flavor , and a sticky-sweet mouthfeel . the color is interesting , but not a beer color . it looks like grape soda . it has a fruity flavor , but there 's some sour undertones that throw it off .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	a : jet black . completely opaque . mocha head but little retention . nice sheets of bubbles clinging to the glass . s : swiss miss . t : carob , ovaltine , roast barley . really respectable . not as candy toothed as i thought it would be . i sometimes shy away from flavored beers because i feel like i 'm drinking a mediocre beer with some additives to mask it . this is a great stout , with chocolate in it . m : smooth and creamy , just the way a chocolate stout should be . somewhat redolent of chocolate milk . a little sparkle of carbonation in there too , but not distracting from the silked out smoothness . o : very satisfying and steadying .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	serving type : 1 pint 6fl oz appearance : pours a light copperish amber w/ a 1 finger head that left minimal lacing smell : a sweet smell . malty and some dark fruit mixed in . first impression fruit wise are banana 's and a citrus in the back . a lot malts and you can get a little bit of the warming alcohol on the nose taste/mouthfeel : sweet malty goodness w/ a very slight dryness at the end . the warming alcohol kicks in and quickly replaces any dryness . nice and crisp but the warming alcohol overpowers the other flavours fairly quickly . if it was a little less `` warm '' i 'd enjoy this a lot more . i also notice a touch of plum near the very end . drinkability : it 's 9 % ... warm ... and tasty . a very enjoyable beer and i will pick up another edit : changing my review a little after enjoying more and more of this beer . the taste has `` grown '' on me and find myself enjoying the beer more and more . although it is still a touch sweet for me ... .the only thing that i do n't care for about this beer is the sweet syrup like taste in my mouth after i drink it . upgrading my taste to a 4 because i find that it is very enjoyable ( a touch sweet ) and knocking the mouthfeel down because the syrup taste lingers a touch oddly .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	xmas beer . merry xmas . dark brown with tawny highlingts . a decent head , but not as long lasting as i am used to from this brewer . smell is sweet and bready , but not the spice overdose i was anticipating . fairly subdued actually . taste is a smack of figgy , raisony sweetness . a bit of a char/ roasted taste comes through too . no bitterness , no cocoa , no espresso , no nuttiness . again , a bit subdued for the xmas beer i was anticipating . mouthfeel was great , but that was to be expected - that is the bruey 's strongest character . the drinkability is ok , but that sweetness limits it . it does mask the alcohol nicely . well done , but i 'd have prefered more spice and odd characteristics over a sweet high alcoholic beer . this was a bit much for one person to kick back .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	05 06 of course . pours a nice apricot gold color into a weisse glass , looks refreshing off the bat . head is pockety , thick , and retentive . the lacing is astouding . very thick and clumpy , coats the glass nicely . the smell is somewhat hoppy and very sweet . very citrusy notes with some herbal aromas perking up . the taste is very approachable ; sweet and hoppy with notes of grapefruit , heavy wheat , other citrus , and some sort of herbal quality which i am still undecided . good bitter aftertaste . mouthfeel is milky , wet , and puckering.. i will definitely be returning to this beer to quench those early and middle spring thirsts with lunch and perhaps a lighter dinner . good seasonal from sam adams , but not the best representation from sam adams .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	22oz bottle . gorgeous dark rusty orange with a bright white head that quickly settles . nutmeg , cinnamon , pumpkin , red wine and acetobacter all on the nose . as the beer warms , the typical pumpkin pie spices die down and the aceto and brett really come to the fore . flavor has little to do in the way of pumpkins and spice . boatloads of tannic red wine barrel and aceto . it 's actually a letdown after the aroma . just the smallest hint of spice , but there 's definitely no pumpkin . fairly watery on the tongue . lively carbonation with a sharp ( but short ) acidic finish . i was exited for this one after smelling , but the lack complexity on the palate coupled with the watery mouthfeel made this one a disappointment . thanks steve !

0.70 0.20 0.70 0.30 0.20	11.2 oz bottle poured into an imperial pint . best before 2009 oct 27 . 5.2 % abv . `` special cream lager '' a - slightly hazy pale golden amber color with what looks like i filled the glass with whipped cream ; a large creamy off-white head with decent retention and specks of lacing as it went down to a thin layer . s - an aroma of dinner pours out . it really smells like a dinner plate of some sort of meat and veggies . there is a distinct aroma i ca n't put my finger on but i 've smelled it before . low malt breadiness and a crisp hop presence but not aroma . it really lacks any beer resembelence . totally off-putting in every way for a beer . ! my dad figured it out ! pea soup with ham chunks in it ! that 's the exact aroma ! why is this in a beer ? ! t - the pea soup flavor is lower-key thankfully but still present enough to overshadow the low sweet malt presence and light hop kiss . why does this taste this way ? i 've never had a beer like this and i hope i never do again ! m - smooth and light-bodied with a fine level of carbonation , if you can look past the wretched flavor/aroma , you may be able to stand it ! d - never again . this is disgusting . it 's not old , it 's not light-struck , it 's just awful . i 'll never get it again and i 'm half thinking of taking the bottle back . it 's easily the worst $ 4 i 've ever spent on a beer and i probably could have gotten away with getting it for $ 1.59 in a mix 6-pack if i had n't said anything . ugh ! swiss biers : you 've got an awful reputation you need to break ! drain pour , here we come ! on a side note , if anyone has experienced this , or knows why i am , please bm me , i really want to know !

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60	chilled bottle into a glass . thanks mattafett ! a : pours an opaque wall of solid orange / amber , but then , i did pour in the yeast slug without thinking . oops . the head is a finger of off-white head with short retention . however , it leaves a nice collar on the brew with some swirls of bubbles in the center . s : bubblegum , slight spice , grassy hops . yeast and lots of clove . t : biscuit , bread , and bubblegum . small presence of grassy hops . and some kind of fruit i ca n't place . pepper and clove in the finish , quite a fair amount of it . it almost makes the beer feel dry , though it 's obviously not . m : light-medium bodied , and a bit watery in the finish . low carbonation . not particularly impressive here . d : i 'm not in love with this one , but it 's pretty tasty .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	pours an opaque golden honey color . my crappy pour produced a slight head of big bubbles that receded quickly . no `` belgian lace '' to be seen . a spicy , clovey aroma . bright , sharp flavors , sharp carbonation . sticky , dry citrus bitter hops . an interesting woodiness or nuttiness from the yeast . slight alcohol warmth , reminiscent of vodka . the high carbonation makes this have an interesting mouthfeel . also , this beer is impressively drinkable for a 9 % beer . this is a good beer and i 'm going to have to return to it and conduct a more thorough review . the 12 ounce sample was n't enough to get a feel for this beer . it seems like it deserves its reputation , but i 'll need to try some more to be sure .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70	had an opportunity to drink a large , bottle conditioned ( corked ) cold one at the brew pub -- les 3 brasseurs a ) the beer was extremely lively . foamed over despite angling the glass ( literally ) on it 's side . for this reason , the pour resulted in a whopping head that took some time to dissipate . once settled , its appearance was quite nice -- a cloudy , amber color with fine lacy carbonation . s ) a wonderful sweet pastry and dark fruit bomb . you can smell the maple . t ) nutty , dark fruits and ginger bread . a bit too sweet for my taste . m ) equal to its appearance , the beer was very lively with abundant carbonation . d ) my wife and i enjoyed this beer and felt it was a good effort . please note : my review would have afforded higher marks had the beer not been so heavily carbonated . this could have been the result of how the beer was handled . then again , we were at the brewer 's pub .

1.00 0.70 0.60 0.70 0.90	i 've always wanted to try olympia beer . when i was a kid it was my dad 's second choice ( along with burgie ) if he could n't get his hands on some brew 102 , the los angeles-area regional favorite . i have n't seen olympia for years , so i bought it when i saw it at my local beverage chainstore . the price was $ 6.99 for a 12-pack . appearance : the can has the vintage olympia emblem and artwork , very retro . the beer poured a beery-yellow with an almost non-existent head . smell : there was hardly any smell at all , good or bad . it 's probably the mildest-smelling beer on the market . at least it 's not offensive . taste : the taste was typical macrobrew , with extra amounts of water . the finish is slightly sweet and nutty . again , it 's inoffensive . mouthfeel : like i said , it 's a watery beer . so the mouthfeel is a lot like drinking a glass of ice water : refreshing , but flat . i would have preferred a higher amount of carbonation . drinkability : drinkable and reasonably smooth , good for a hot day or a long ( six to 12 beers ) drinking session . overall : olympia is an ok beer at a good price .

0.70 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	on the handpump at fat heads last night ... 20oz pour in a bubbled mug a - very thin layer of loose white lace , sitting atop a slightly hazy burnt orange colored beer . the foam sat as a lowly ring throughout most of the drink , very small amount of yeast settles at the bottom of the glass . s - mostly crackery and bready malt , lightly touched by some caramel sweetness . very subtle layer of slightly grassy hop bitterness finishes it off . t - again , crackers and stale bread take the spotlight . very milkd through the middle , just a tiny spot of sweetness before turning into some mild earthy hops . m - extremely light and watery , typical carbonation from a cask . only slightly creamy and biting at the end . d - a god representation of the classic style , but just not doing enough for me . crazily drinkable though , thanks to an extremely light body and mild taste . a good first beer for happy hour while waiting for friends to show up , before moving onto some bigger guns .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	enjoyed on tap at `` japon '' ( french spelling ) night at dieu du ciel . tastes like an aged beer , its very dry and cuvee-like . significant hops.its wierd but it does smell like a barleywine . amber with white head . a bit undewhelming mouthfeel.there was some problem with foam in the taps , and maybe if i had this in the wee hours . still good .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	a- orange with cream colored head that lasts forever . slightly cloudy due to the swirl and pour of the yeast . s- malt , cane sugar , fruity esters , toffee , malt , caramel , spice , white pepper , plum , so much more ... . t- initial sweet malt , then some maple and almond , some citrus , a bit of spice and pepper , finish of smooth malt , honey , and then a smooth alcohol and sweet sugar/malt finish . mmmm . m- smooth , but a tad thin . carbonation is good , as is the thoroughly smooth finish with a tad of warmth . d- mmm . once again . very good .

0.80 0.60 0.20 0.30 0.20	in a tulip : looks good , dark with reasonable head and strange sheeting lacing . smells ok , about where i 'd expect a porter to be , with hints of coffee accompanied by an undeniable metallic odor . tasted good at first ... but then it went all wrong . good malty start , but the worst aftertaste i 've had in a while . coffee was pleasant ... then just became repulsive . it had an adhesive quality both in texture and in taste . watery . stinging carbonation . overall : i was n't expecting much from baltika . i 've learned not to . this is probably the best beer i 've had from them . avoid . try victory 's baltic thunder if you 're looking for bang for your buck and a solid baltic porter .

0.40 0.70 0.30 0.40 0.50	poured into nonic pint ... a- pours deep dark reddish brown . absolutely no head on a generous pour . sits in the glass murky and lifeless . s- has a sweet , carmelly , and nutty aroma . all of this is slightly shadowed by a sour , acetic smell ... t/m- whoa . wtf ? ! starts very nutty and bready , then just gets excessively hot and full of ethanol . the aftertaste is just hard to swallow . i feel like there is a solid base beer behind the fusels . could be a great , sweet , malty brown ... also a ton of roast/coffee flavor for a brown , again drowned out though . the feel is just slimy and stings the tongue . o- as the beer warmed it got better . when i first opened this and took a drink , it screamed infection . though it wasnt infected , it did have intense flaws that unfortunately overtook the majority of the drinking experience .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	pours an ever so slightly hazed bright yellow with a thin whisp of a white head . sticky legs on its way down . smell is a tad bit muted -- especially compared to the taste . initial impression is quite hoppy with some citrus rind . not too much depth , but excellent bitterness level . mouthfeel is fantastic ... light , dry , well carbonated , and quite bitter . superb drinkability . glad this made its way out to dc .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.70	received as an extra in a recent trade . 22 oz . bottle poured into my 'crab house ' pint glass . a- dark , not much lacing . does n't look like a very thick ris . quite a few bubbles . s- not too much here . pretty weak . subtle maltiness ? ? t- not bad . more of a milk stout style to me . when i read ris , i expect less carbonation , heavier mouthfeel , more chocolate , molasses flavor . good taste , just not the right taste imo . m- pretty thin for the style . o- if i was at the brewery i would have it again but i won ; t be searching it out .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	sampled at 1702 , tucson ; april 2010 this beer arrives from the tap with a dark , concentrated amber / brown color that shows a clear'ish hue in the light . it is topped by a thin , creamy textured , dark tan to amber-tinged colored head . bourbon aromatics jump out at me from the get-go ; notes of vanillin , coconut , a hint of woody spiciness , lots of oak-wood like fresh cut plank aromas and even a touch of alcohol heat are noticeable . the aroma is quite nice , but leaves me wondering were the aromatics from the base beer are . the beer is sweet tasting as it first hits my mouth , with a viscous , chewy character that finishes with a hot alcohol and bourbon spiciness that lingers on the palate ; it actually does remind me of sipping on bourbon . there are lots of flavors reminiscent of vanilla and toasted coconut ; wow , the bourbon barrel really just completely dominates this beer . luckily the malt is big and sweet enough to carry all the barrel character , but you better really like bourbon if you are going to enjoy this beer . the base beer really plays a subservient role here . the barley wine does contribute a lush texture , with caramelized malt sweetness and some toasted malt character . the beer finishes with a really spicy , almost hot at times , peppery barrel character that lingers on the palate for quite some time . the vanillin and coconut notes are nice in this beer and it is well accentuated by the malt sweetness , but this is too hot and too bourbon dominated in the end . if you really like bourbon then i can see this being quite the enjoyable tipple , but it is perhaps a bit too much for me .

0.60 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	i was cleaning out a closet today and i found this beer review that i had written earlier this year . delirium tremens is a hazy , quite sparkling , golden ale with small particles floating in it . it has a foamy white head that shows good retention and leaves good lacing . the aroma has notes of sugar , barnyard , leather , nutmeg and candy , like mike & ikes . it is medium-full bodied ; soft and smooth with a dry finish . it has a very full flavor that 's slightly sweet . there are notes of leather , black pepper , apple and phenol . it has a warm , boozy aftertaste . quite classic !

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.60	a golden color and a little hazy . the head that dies immediately . no head retention and no lacing . lots of bubbles let you know that the beer is still alive though . sweet , citrusy and a good helping of ginger . it 's actually a pretty nice aroma . thin and spritzer like . all of the carbonation and sweet citrus flavor up front almost makes you think you 're drinking a soda but then you get a mix of grapefruit and ginger . those flavors are then joined by a light malt base but it 's the ginger that rides your tongue all the way through the finish . it 's very refreshing but it barely feels like i 'm drinking a beer . i think i could get something very similar by mixing ginger ale and grapefruit juice . it 's very refreshing and good for the summertime heat , but it needs to look and feel like a beer .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	12 oz . twist-off bottle , coded lot/bottling number on the neck of the bottle ( 1688 ) , sampled in a tulip glass . l : filtered clear copper golden with a fluffy , billowy white head that slowly settled into a thin sudsy layer . a good deal of splotchy curtain-like lace clings to the brim of the glass , helping to make this a good looking belgian pale ale . s : pepper , clove , earthy nuts and spryly tart apple and pear fruitiness , with a backing of lightly toasted grainy bread and honey pilsener malts , i thought this was pretty spot on for the bpa style . further whiffs reveals a little herbal hop spiciness . the alcohol is barely noticeable , just a mellow peppery solvent scent . f & t : i would have liked a tad more carbonation , this bpa would benefit from a more active carbonation , it would have provided the light body a much needed crispy firmness in the mouthfeel . this feels just a bit too flat in the mouth . toasty pale malts , turning doughy towards the end , which are complemented by a honey pilsener crackeriness , along with the added sugary dextrose , gives prairie gold a delectably sweet backbone . in the middle a mildly tart fruitiness emerges , green apples and pears , that mixes with pepper and clove spiciness . the hops are properly light in the taste , lemongrass before becoming dryly spicy in the finish . once again , the alcohol is really not that perceptible , just a very low grade peppery , spicy warmth in the palate . other than the inadequate level of carbonation , i thought capital has crafted a good bpa , quite in keeping with the style , easy to drink and tasty , a welcomed new summer release from this middleton , wisconsin brewery .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	picked this beer out at random while looking for something to supplement my 6- pack of longboard and chose this pils . i think i picked it because it had fancy gold foil wrapped around the neck and it was cheap , sold me . on to the beer.. a- standard golden straw you 'd expect from a german pilsner . head was n't really there , but no big deal here . s- i like the way this beer smelled . had a subtle cereal malt smell to it , so i knew it would probably taste sweet and malty . i would be right . t- strong malt profile that is quite sweet most of the way through . reminds me very much of the scrimshaw pils of north coast . about 2/3 through the i get a very vibrant hop bitterness just as flavorful as the sweet cereal taste . this beer has alot of character to it imo . the flavors transition just at the right moment when you feel like it might be too sweet . no real lingering aftertaste , it finishes fairly dry . m- when i go to take a swig i get a nosefull of malt which i think makes this enjoyable to drink . it has medium bubbles . i can definetly feel bubbles on my tongue the whole time . maybe just a tad too bubbly but i would n't complain openly about it , just keep it as a low priority thought . o- this is a good example of a vibrant pilsner out of germany . i had alot of fun swishing this beer around and getting the full extent of it . i would not chug this beer , it does great taking medium mouthfulls and taking in the character of the beer . as a fan of pilsner beers , i will chaulk this up as a `` buy again '' brand .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.60	on-tap at the pub ... a dark straw body , very clear . not much head , poor retention but solid lacing ... the aroma is surprisingly sweet , tons of sweet candied toffee , candied sugar , herbs . nothing like any bitter i 've had . really good for an esb , but seems off for the style ... the taste is beyond weird , but one of the most complex beers i 've ever had . there are three distinct segments that have wholesale changes in flavor . the start is sweet , very similar to juice . the middle is dead but with alcohol . the finish is a hop bomb . i do n't particularly like this but its certainly interesting . not a traditional esb and not easy to drink . however , its so unique its worth trying .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.90 0.60	poured from a 16.9 oz . bottle into a chimay goblet ... not a lot of head in the glass , although it did foam over after popping the top . very murky brownish color with a hint of red ... looks like some sediment made it into this first pour too . sweet & spicy aroma , a little funk to it . definitely some trub in there ... but otherwise the taste is pretty solid . kinda like a spicy strong belgian version of a milder brown ale . i like it , even though i have a feeling this one was past its shelf-life . i 'll have to check this one out again on a fresher bottle , this one is n't doing it justice i 'm sure .

0.80 0.40 0.70 0.30 0.40	a pour from the tap at tj 's during the great lakes family reunion philly beer week event on 6/9/2011 . poured into a nonic pint . a 1 finger head sits on top of a coppery orange colored body that is pretty clear . not much haze in this one at all . the lacing is solid , as well , as some rings are interconnected by spiderwebby lacing , which fades even more as i get to the bottom of the glass . the aroma ... wow ... sure there are some hops in there , and i can pick up faint aromas of bready malts , but this beer smells like smoked salmon . straight up , no two ways about it . i guess i am intrigued , so even though i am slightly put off by the aroma , there is something that makes me really want to taste it . on the palate , i ca n't decide if this is better or worse . i am going to go with worse , since i could n't get through the whole glass . the balanced pale ale is completely overwhelmed by the fishy smokiness that permeates every bit of this brew . this is a beer that if you did n't know that you liked smoked salmon , and you tasted the beer without ever having had the fish , you would love it . i ca n't disassociate the two , though . this feels good on the palate , minus the off-putting smokey twang . good carbonation , and medium to light texture put this at a good representation of what the texture should feel like for this style . overall , i think i only drank as much of this as i did because it was intriguing . not because it was good . i ca n't say that i would recommend this , as there are much better glbc beers out there .

0.60 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.70	as far as light beers go , lionshead light offers great value . it 's got more flavor than many others with a nice grainy maltiness . it pours an attractive golden body with a nice white head that holds pretty well and leaves some minor lace at the outset of the glass . the aroma is generic `` beer '' , but that 's to be expected . it 's light bodied and crisp ; and nicely balanced with a firm , underlying bitterness and some mild background hops . it 's far from the best beer that the lion makes , but it 's nicely done and the price can not be beat !

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.70 0.80	750 ml bottle with ref no 143351 on the baled cork . a date of 19/12/08 appears on the bottom of the back label . pours a pale straw body capped with three fingers of rapidly dissapating dingy white foam . clarity is decent on the initial pour and lacing is not apparent . nose is sharp with corriander and orangeskin with a backdrop of belgian yeasties . entry is quiet with slight co scrubbing of the sides of the tongue . midtaste is quaffable wheat presence while the finish focuses the senses on the back of the tongue where the oranges and spices play . corriander mixes with the lightest touch of anise to provide a dry , pleasing swallow . this is one of the best beers i 've had in terms of spotting wheat in the body and it contributes to one of the most palatable mouthfeels i 've experienced in a belgian wit bier .

0.60 0.60 0.40 0.50 0.80	live review . poured from the 12 oz . bottle that i bought as a single for $ 1.99 at north coast wine & beer on w. 117th st in cleveland two days ago into my samuel smith pint glass . no observed `` best by '' date . a pours a slightly hazy yellow body under a brief but creamy white head that leaves trace lacing . 3.0 s muted wheat , slightly sweet but mostly barley , grains to the smell . just fine . 3.0 t watery wheat ale this could be called . there are some tastes of barley and i guess some wheat but it is really watery . there may also be a touch of hops . 2.5 m thin , with only the grain tastes and the slightest stickiness keeping it from being water itself . 2.0 d good , which is the point really i believe . 4.0 notes : my least favorite st beer , one i am sure that is intended as a session beer ( just none of my sessions ) .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	what a pour ! light golden color with great clarity . huge four finger head in matching duvel glassware . carbonation just keeps coming . head rises like a loaf of bread , forming one inch tall chimney in middle of head . pour this one slowly . i have had some react violently at times . creamy white in color , like a huge cumulous cloud on a mid-west summer 's day . smells of herbal yeast and hops . flavor is herbal , like wild onion stalks , hops , yeast , long dead apricots and a touch of malt thrown in for pleasure . oh , the head is receding now , but still this center proboscis of foam persists . along with patchy lacing on the sides . the mouthfeel is medium thin and tart . nice dryness in the aftertaste . watch-out ! a few of these will catch you off guard . this devil does n't feel like 8 % in the mouth . it prefers to slide down the throat and kick you in the ass .

0.30 0.50 0.30 0.60 0.70	what can one say about bud light ? not a whole lot here . probably the most nonchalant beer ever , although this one seems to have a little more bite than usual . she 's pretty yellow , not unlike urine . it tastes ok , and goes down fairly easy . you wo n't even notice it when you drink it , which is n't always a bad thing .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.60	330ml bottle from vintage cellars , newtown and poured into a mikkeller tulip . pours a deep brown with a ruby tinge around the edges . has a moderately deep beige head of foam that laces ok and settles just above film . smell has plenty of cinnamon with a fruit mince pies coming in afterwards . only a little bit of ginger and nutmeg as well , but these do n't stay for long . interesting , but does get overpowered just a little with the cinnamon . taste has cinnamon in droves with just a little bit of chocolate at the back end . too over the top with the cinnamon with it bashing everything else into submission . mouthfeel is on the light side , a bit thin and then there is the spice at the end that sort of takes the place of any possible lingering bitterness . it certainly does n't encourage you to rush back into another mouthful . a thinnish stout that looks and smells alright and is too one-dimensional with the spice . it all goes a bit downhill once you start to sip . however as a winter warmer , with a bit more body and a more varied spice flavour , this would pretty well hit the mark .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80	hmm , i 'm not quite sure what to make of this one . i reminds me of both a czech/bohemian pils and a euro pale lager . it has a bit of generic macro aroma and taste , but not necessarily in a bad way . the flavor is actually a bit complex . there seems to be a touch of diacetyl , or something similar , to add a buttery-cream quality . there a fruity yeast component , a bit of bready grains , and a mellow , but relatively assertive bit of hops . definately worth a try .

0.80 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.40	750ml bottle poured into a goblet . a : brown body with the typical giant belgian head . s : dark fruits and spices . t : similar to the aroma . not overly phenolic , but still cloying . i do n't know , it just did n't click for me . m : reasonably light with good carbonation . d : i like more plum and bready flavors in my quads , and they 're totally absent in this one . drain pour .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60	this beer pours a straw color with a head that has minimal retention but leaves some lacing . there 's a long steady flow of bubbles swimming to the surface . the smell is clean but not much else can be said of it ; it is very faint . the taste starts out rather sweet but the hops force through at the end to create a bitterness . there 's not a lot of complexity here , but it still works for the most part . the best part of this one is the mouthfeel ; to my surprise , it is rather thick , at least for a beer of this style . despite this , it goes down pretty well . i 'm not sure i 'd ever seek this one out , but it was n't bad by any means .

0.70 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.60	a clear , pale yellow-orange colour , with a thin white cap . lots of visible carbontion rises to the head . sweet grain is dominant in the aroma . almost a sweetened lemonade smell . ca n't say that hops are notable . slightly sweet and grainy , cracker like malts . crisp , with very little hop finish , something a little medicinal is all i can attribute to the hops . still some of that sweet lemonade impresson . does n't impress really . light to medium body , with ample carbonation , it does pretty well for a lighter lager . i get the feeling that this is tree 's stab at turning some of the macro drinkers on to their beers . better than the macros , but something about the flavour really does n't appeal to me .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80	unfortunately the bottle i tried was almost at its best before date . fortunately it was still pretty good . colour was deep amber with a good old-fashioned `` priest 's collar '' head . the aroma was a little earthy with strong biscuit malts . the taste had a little of the `` bitter water '' quality about it often found in older beers . it could however be the actual flavour itself . with a few sips i got used to it and was left with a very hearty brew . very smooth and highly drinkable . perhaps the bitter water hampers it a little bit but i will let it slide due to the freshness . failing that the cool label is enough to make me forget about it .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	drank every beer on tap at mccall brewing one weekend with the little lady , except this one . so of course , i brought back a growler of it . drank out of my black butte porter pint glass . appearance- pours a dark brownish mahogany with about a one finger sand head . leaves a random cap and an excellent collar that lasts the whole beer . leaves quite a bit of lacing as well . smell- a very nice lightly smoked peat is present along with a bit of sweet malt . nice and doughy at the same time along with a slight bit of a citrus hop ( very little ) . the smokiness is the star of the nose though . taste- lots of rich toasted malt and sweet/toasty caramel malt are abundant in this one . a slight bit of smokiness is present but nowhere near the amount in the nose . nice citrus tones as well , which kind of surprised me considering the huge dose of malt you get from the start . sitting at 8.0 % , id have no idea as the alcohol isnt anywhere to be found . mouthfeel- light body with a very crisp , refreshing feel . light to medium carbonation . drinkability- this is a really solid brew . id say the best that i had of all the mccall brews . if you like scotch ales , this is most definitely worth a try . solid ass brew .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	nitro can with widget . typical nitro-induced typhoon of a pour . settled to a nice finger of tan foam over a body of tar-black liquid . aromas of coffee , toast , malt and herbal hops . flavor was fairly balanced between malt and hops , maybe 60/40 hops . a bit thin , but a very good stout flavor develops in the mouth . notes of chocolate , caramel , coffee , toast , peat , and grapefruit were present as well . i 'd have preferred a bit fuller body .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	a mahogany colored brown ale ; definitely on the light end of the color spectrum for brown ale . remarkably clear for an english ale . either no bottle-conditioning here or a very flocculent yeast . very complex aroma with lots of musty leather , coffee and a nutty character . the flavor is complex , too , with echoes of the nuttiness ( i 'm thinking hazelnut and brazil nuts . ) , a bit of coffee with cream , an earthy-oakiness and maybe a touch of marzipan . the finish is tawny with a rustic bitterness mixed with the full body . i seems to remember this coming across drier and not as full . very , very smooth though and still quite a classic .

0.80 0.40 0.60 0.20 0.20	this is my first review , and its of the first beer i have ever sent back because it was that bad . there was no aroma to speak of , though the mouthfeel and the color were just fine . it came out looking very appetizing actually , but i took a swig , and had a initial citrus flavor - ok , this is encouraging - followed by ... the distinct taste ... of dirt . it actually had a soil aftertaste . disgusting . a complete waste . undrinkable .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.70	sampled on-tap at grizzly peak , this dis pours a dark opaque black with some tight bubbles . the creamy thick head , characteristic of the style , recedes slowly and leaves some great lace . not a terribly aromatic beer with just a bit of roasted malt . some toasty sweetness as well . fairly uneventful . very creamy and heavily malty . roasty and smooth with some smoke and a slight woody bourbon twang . some cocoa is present as well . a good example of a dis ; a solid selection for sure . very creamy , frothy , and moderately dry . fairly low carbonation makes for an even creamier texture . not too thick , but satisfying . not my favorite dis but a solid beer for sure .

0.90 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60	this brutal little number poured out with a very nice looking colour that was crimson to purple . it formed a substantial creamy head of tan that held nicely and left gobs of lacing as the drink was drunk . the nose is nicely arranged with fresh floral hoppiness . it is somewhat grassy and herbal , but mostly citrus bloom . the malt character underneath smells potent and mixes with a biting alcohol scent to throw some roughness on the pile . crusty . stinging . astringent . but a lovely bloom of hoppiness . the taste is not all that special . i think it is a bit abrasive for my tastes . i have no problem with the decent amount of hop character displayed here . in fact , that is the saving grace for this brew . it has a crusty and biting side to it that is not all that appealing to me . i guess i am not worthy , but this is just not my style . it just feels dirty and brutal save for the hops . this feels more assaultive than many huge brews that i 've had . astringent . mouthfeel is good . it has a nice body to it . it is just wasted on a sort of wild charactered brew . coats the mouth nicely and the head throws off some creaminess . the drinkability is average . i see no reason to drink this when there are beers that are much less offensive that have a true style to them . by far the worst stone beer that gets the most press and praise . the strong ale catch all is just not a solid situation . i prefer structure . this is a bit messy for me . if this thing were about 14 % abv , i think i would be more appreciative of it because i could forgive some of the harsh abrasiveness . as it stands it tastes like a monster only it is not really that strong considering . this beer has a great name . i wish it deserved to be so arrogant though . i think some people have been punked out by the smack talk on the bottle . nice jedi mind tricks . stone 's other products are much more deserving of the praise . they make some truly stellar beers . that being said , i am not feeling this one and i will not pretend to be .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.80 0.50	poured from a 750ml champagne bottle into a tulip chalice . bottle marked as 2002 vintage . clear signs of aging on it 's side , good hard yeast residue on one side . virtually flat - appears as if i got a bottle that was n't properly sugared ? the last glass had a hint of head around the edge of the glass , but this one never tasted at all carbonated . this was possibly the primary reason i did n't rate higher on many accounts . color is a beautiful dark reddish-brown , properly opaque with suspended yeast as you 'd expect from a craftbrewed belgian . smell is of rich red apple , sweet yeast , white wine grapes , mild honey when warm . taste switches to green apples thanks to a light but fruity hopping . middle is of metallic minerals followed by slight caramel , warm leather , and a powdery finish . alcohol is clearly there , but in lesser quantity than the label claims . the flatness of this bottle took away from drinkability , exacerbated by the very dry character of the brew in general . the best thing about this brew is that it 's so belgian in character - it smells like my favourite belgian pub in every way .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	pours a deep amber mahogany with almost no head . aroma is of black licorice , toffee , dark fruits , and hints of vanilla . taste is of toffee , blackberries , vanilla , and oak . heavy mouthfeel with a long finish . definitely not watery . overall a decent beer .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	i think this beer would fill me up before a meal but it is not bitter and i like that . nice smell , apples and other fruits . i had an after taste that was a little sticky but other than that ... a great beer . even my wife liked it and she hates all this shit . all in all , from the husband of a wine drinker ... if she likes it . it must be good .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.60	appearance - deep and dark , even against strong light it shows little color around the edges . thin mocha head is short-lived , with all bubbles disappearing after 3 or 4 minutes , leaving this porter bare-topped . aroma - decent nose of smoky charred malts . on style , fades a bit but holds its own . taste - sweet , chocolatey , with a dose of burnt coffee beans following the swallow . a standard and tasty porter it is . mouthfeel - has an element of smoothness , but is also on the watery side , giving the beer a somewhat diluted feel . drinkability - an average porter , i 'd have no trouble drinking this at the brewery but i do n't think i 'd go out of my way to bring it home .

0.70 0.90 0.90 0.80 0.50	poured a very nice looking deep red . not much head and what there was dissipated rather quickly . left some nice lacing around the edges . smells great . i first noticed the cherries , then some chocolate . also noticed some mint which was interesting . was expecting this to have a nice chocolate cherry profile from the smell , but it did not . instead i picked up more earthy tastes . tastes very toasty , almost smoky . burnt toast and a bit like burning wood and peat . also picked up some tobacco notes , like a nice cigar . alcohol is noticeable but not prominent . mouthfeel was thick , chewy and syrupy . low carbonation . this was very filling giving it a lower drinkability . would be hard to drink of lot of . overall this was a good looking , great smelling beer with some very complex flavors . only downfall was how filling it was , because i 'd love to have had another right away .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	a - this renowned old ale pours a dark red into a tulip glass with a thick smooth tan head with the beer too dark to see any but slight hints of carbonation s - raisins are the first sensation in the aroma , followed swiftly by toffee and vanilla , with some background hints of anise t - the taste has the same elements as the aroma , dark sweetness like that of raisins or dates up front , followed shortly by the lighter sweetness of vanilla and toffee , these flavors start of not subdued , but without intensity , but the intensity grows as the taste culminates in a big finish m & d - smooth and mellow for such a high abv , flavors and mouthfeel entice with every sip , one of the easier 13+ % beers i have had , quite a good job , worth the 700 miles the new menu has this beer at 13.5 %

0.90 1.00 0.60 1.00 0.70	had this sucker on a disgustingly hot day in june of 2008 at the dogfish head brewery in milton de . four beers on tap that day for people to sample . first ths sixty , then the ninety . then the lady brings out a pitcher of this beautiful reddish stuff with a nice head on it . wow , what is that ? ! ? ! poured into a plastic cup , swigged it down . wowee ! first thought that came to mind : lambic . very easy drinking beer that tasted like a lindeman 's framboise , but not disgustingly sweet or filling . this stuff is mind blowing . should have got a case ! another winner from dfh !

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	note : reviewed from 5oz sample a - pours dark brown with a serious foam head of cream color that retains well and gives nice lacing . s - scents of cocoa powder , caramel , and brown sugar . getting a sweet tooth smelling this one . t - tastes like a candy store ; chocolate , toffee , caramel , and a roasted burnt malt that gives a tiny bit of smoke to this . m - smooth as silk . this is a hearty brown ale that is so easy to drink and is gentle on the taste buds . can easily kick back this on a cool evening . o - impressive brown ale that has a chocolatey taste . i like the dominant sweetness that makes this feel like a dessert beer . this is one angel that you want at arms reach at all times .

0.80 0.90 1.00 1.00 0.50	holy sweet and sour chicken , batman ! this is a wild brew -- when i first tried it , i remember calling another beer loving friend and saying , `` run , do not walk , to riley 's and buy new glarus 's sour brown . it is utterly unlike anything i have ever experienced before . '' indeed , at the time it was . wow , this is one rotten-ass beer . notes of balsamic are there , but the overriding feeling is that of decay . the way i see it , an innocent brown ale was walking down the street one day , minding its own business . . . when dan the brewerman came , kidnapped this beer and placed it in his basement slowly killing it over a matter of months before leaving it in a dumpster to rot . yet the beer is surprisingly sweet , which balances out the sour , rotten flavour . a truly complex beer , with years and years of trauma to be worked out by your tongue . highly recommended to try . . . though i must admit i feel guilty . you see , my friend bought a 4-pack of this stuff . it 's good , but i 'm not sure i 'd want more than two in my lifetime .

0.50 0.50 0.60 0.40 0.30	a- pours a reddish purple color with a nice reddish colored head . head had fairly good retention and leaves pretty much no lacing . s- shockingly enough it smells of raspberries . t- this tasted more like a wine cooler to me than a beer . raspberries all over the place and pretty much nothing else . m- light in body and light to medium in carbonation . d- wow i will pass on this one .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.80	limited release form sweetwater . pours an orangeish/reddish amber with a large off-white head that quickly dissipates . leaves some lacing . the smell is very floral and earthy , along with hints of lemon and spice . the first thing i notice with this beer is the watery mouthfeel . it is pretty hoppy with a lot of bitterness and some lemon zest flavor in there . the malt profile of this one is totally bland , this is n't what i would expect from a limited release brew . overall this is an average brew , just tastes like a hoppier version of this typically over-pedestrian style . the mouthfeel is terrible .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	a 12 oz/355 ml brown bottle ( $ 2.49 ) at belmont station . poured to a pint glass ; brewed since 1922 and 'named after the elephant that killed george hurst , one of the brewery 's founders ' . unfortunate , yet somewhat cool , to have a brewer crushed by a pachyderm . a : pale golden , yet full of carbonation . a fizzy whitish head that fades quickly , building to just shy of a finger then dropping to a thin film . clear complexion . s : sweet and corny aroma . sweet dough , mild fruit ( apple ? ) . t : corn pops and the mildest of spices . a bit of grass and peppery dryness blended with the sweeter grains . m : super-smooth , eminently drinkable . lighter body , but crisp/clean finishing . d : just fine for drinking as a food accompaniment , but not a beer i have to return to by itself . this was a gamble - a try-worthy beer from a foreign land ; as such it was decent enough but not one worth seeking out .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	a : nice dark cola color , like coke blak . medium head retention . s : coffee aroma , whiffs of chocolate and an alcohol presence . t : coffee here again . roasted malts , somewhat sweet . m : i was disappointed here . i felt it was somewhat thin for the taste/smell . a heavier body with thicker mouthfeel would add a lot to this beer . d : very drinkable and the abv is just about right for a few pints . not a session beer ( for me anyway ) but i could but 2 or 3 away in an evening . overall i like this beer a lot but there 's plenty of stiff competition out there for it to stand against . great local offering . chloe was great and fits the extreme category fairly well but i would be hard pressed to call derek 'extreme ' .

0.90 0.70 0.40 0.50 0.50	overrated beer at its finest . unfortunately , the best part of this beer is its appearance . i could pour these all day ... and then not drink them . smell is bits of coffee . mostly unremarkable . taste is not that good . the first time i had a guinness , i thought it was a pretty solid beer . after i had `` real '' beers , i had another guinness and was not impressed . tastes like it smells - like coffee lite . aside from that , the taste , like the smell , is unremarkable mouthfeel is borderline watery . drinkability is not that below average since the beer is filling and not that tasty as it turns out . try the extra draught . it 's much better .

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40	thin brownish head , dark ruddish body . no visible carbination . huge vinous aroma . this is not beer , it is red wine vinegar made with malt . sour with an earthy base . low carbination , medium body . sweetness is present to balance the sour , but this is not chinese food , so i will pass on the sweet and sour combination . smooth on the palate , the beer says nothing , if it does not say sour cherries .

0.70 0.50 0.50 0.70 0.80	coppery , loses head quickly , leaving very little webbing . honey and something else -- almonds ? -- on the nose , but a little too cloying . fairly complex taste , with more flavors and spices than i could ever hope to identify . the depth of the flavor is somewhat overshadowed by an astringent follow-through , though . it 's not bad , but at it 's rather high price point i do n't believe i 'll buy it again . [ 750ml bottle , poured in a mug ]

0.70 0.50 0.50 0.80 0.90	the tut brown poured reddish-brown with a small , fizzy head that was quickly gone . the aroma was very light toasted malt and some sweetness . the taste was nutty , toffee malt with some sugary sweetness and a crisp , slightly bitter , finish . it was a little thin and watery going down . overall , i thought this was a nice tasting , very quaffable brew .

0.90 0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80	550ml bottle poured into a pint glass . a = brilliant topaz with very light haze , incredibly soft carbonation bubbling , forms a small one finger head of bone white foam and small bubbles that subside into a thin foam covering on about 80 % of the surface which very , very slowly reduces coverage of surface area until little remains by the end of the pint , also a strong concentration around the edge . s = strong smell of caramel , just a little butterscotch and butter , maple syrup , almond paste , a really good blend of smells . t = wow , this is really , really tasty . the maple syrup qualities are almost as strong as you find in a stronger , more concentrated beer like thomas hardy 's ale , jw lees harvest or harvey 's elizabethan ale . at the same time it has the distinctive samuel smith 's caramel/butterscotch flavor . there is a really good amount of balancing bitterness in this , too . the front of the tongue gets a full dose and the finish has a nice dry , bitterness . m = at the start i found the bite of the carbonation too forceful as it stung my tongue , after a bit though it mellowed out nicely and had a much softer feel . mouthcoating is good and body is medium . d = this is really a fine drinking beer . easy to drink quite a bit of it and also good enough to want to come back to again .

0.80 1.00 0.60 1.00 1.00	growler courtesy of a very generous trader , thanks man ! the beer pours a very dark , motor oil black color with a 1/2 inch brown head . the aroma is of strong coffee and roasted malts . there is a lot of cream in the first sip with coffee following quickly . my only complaint with this beer is that it is a little thin . regardless , this beer is one of my new favorite coffee stouts !

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	dark foggy purple black in color . nice white dense creamy head and great retention . aroma is of mouth watering juicy plums and cherries with sweet yeast , caramel , mocha , and molasis . taste is full of flavor . nice and thick too . chocolate covered cherry syrup , plum , grape and probably some awesome . the lush velvety texture takes control of your mouth . nice bitter cherry-like finish . real yummy . i 'm glad i finally picked this up and i will definitely get it again .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.60	clear reddish amber with a rich firm tan head . vague chemical aroma of nuts , cedar wood , diacetyl and oranges . light floral flavour of nuts and paint with a harsh bark like bitternes . hints of citric acid and diacetyl . the overall impression is ; chemical ! . bitter nutty aftertaste with a strong note of butterscotch . not a huge fan

0.90 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.80	this christmas ale pours a nice , tan head . the color of the beer itself is a rich amber color ... an eye-pleasing ruby-orange . in essence , it smells like a heavy , hoppy ale . the predominant flavor is a malt-chocolate , alcohol taste . the sharp hops finish wonderfully , lingering for a bit and then come back for a moment on the tongue to bite back . a bit playful . for a brief second , i get the essence of a mellow scotch coming through on the finish as well . and ultimately , this is a flavor that grows as it is sipped . i recommend this as a sipper to go along with a macanudo as puffing material .

0.90 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.60	pours absolutely crystal clear . it has a good head , but it dissipates fast . the aroma is rather faint . what little there is is bready , but not much else . the first flavor that hits me , unfortunately , is a buttery diacetyl flavor . beyond that , i ca n't taste much anything in here at all . like the riley 's red from the same brewer , it is n't bad , it just is n't much anything at all . in fact , the brewery claims this is their most popular beer , with riley 's red also being popular . it 's easy to see why , as there is nothing here to challenge a macro drinker . while i list riley 's as my least favorite on my trip , this one ives it a run for its money , as neither offer much to a beer drinker .

0.30 0.60 0.60 0.40 0.40	appearance : despite an increasingly hard pour , no head arose over the espresso brown liquid smell : dark chocolate , espresso , bourbon and sour tones taste : if you keep this beer isolated to the sweet receptor cells on the tip of the tongue , it is rather nice , with dark chocolate , coffee and bourbon tones ; sadly , if you move the liquid back and wash it over the receptors on the sides of the tongue , the sourness from what appears to be a lactobacillus infection become apparent and overwhelm the stout flavors mouthfeel : full bodied with almost no carbonation overall : sorry to see what has happened to this beer but recommend that those who have a bottle drink it sooner rather than later as the infection spreads as i doubt that it is what matt intended ; i really enjoyed his beers when he was at flossmoor so i know about his capabilities ; better beers are coming , i am sure thanks , chumba526 , for the opportunity

0.70 0.70 0.60 0.90 1.00	this was first experience with a klsch . i thought it was pretty good though . poured from a 500ml bottle into a mug . it poured a light clear golden color . there was a fluffy white head that dissipated quickly , leaving a thin white lacing . has a bready aroma mixed with a slightly sweet smell . my nose may be fooling me but i think i smelled a hint of raisins as well . the first sip tastes of sweet malts and bread . there is also a background fruity taste , of possibly raisins and figs . a slight aftertaste of piney hops comes through as i swallow the sip . there was also a good balanced amount of carbonation . this brew had a much more complex taste than i was expecting when i poured it . the mouthfeel was thin with a slightly dry aftertaste . i found this beer to extremely drinkable . i am going to have to get moer of these .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.60	appearance - brown and copper color beer with minimal carbonation . very light head with little retention . there is a big sticky ring of lacing around the edges . aroma - sweet and fruity smell with a sort of burnt plum and raisin aroma . taste - there seems to be the same raisin sort of flavor and a nice bitterness but it 's very sweet and cloying . the mouthfeel is good , full and creamy . the drinkability is average but a touch too sweet to enjoy a lot of .

0.80 0.70 0.30 0.30 0.30	purchased as part of `` build-your-own-six-pack '' at local grocer . poured a lovely amber , with a smallish head . smelled sweet , citrusy , but not overpowering . sadly , the taste was overpowered by the citrus . could n't pick out anything other than grapefruit . fizzier than it looks . not a huge fan of pale ales , but i 've had some pretty good ones . this is not one of them .

0.70 0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80	12oz bottle my girlfriend bought in michigan into a new belgium snifter . appearance ( 3.5 ) : very dark brown with orange around the edges . pours with a thin layer of head but it sticks around for a long time . lacing is minimal . aroma ( 3 ) : a strong boozy chocolate and nutty smell . some oak and vanilla but dominated by ethanol mixed with pine . much better when it 's cold - hiding the booziness - than when it has warmed . taste ( 4 ) : a nutty chocolate flavor up front with some vanilla . more oak and vanilla through the middle and a sweet chocolate in the finish . lots of flavors you would associate with a porter but much stronger and mixed with ethanol . mouthfeel ( 2.5 ) : syrupy and thick in the taste but not the finish . slick yet creamy . medium to full bodied and low to medium carbonation ( but maybe it 's been sitting for awhile since it took a while to finish ) . too syrupy for as thin as the finish is and not enough carbonation for me . overall ( 4 ) : lots of great flavors , but too big for this style imo . the booziness really shows and there 's a lot of residual sugar which it would be better off without . i will drink this again , if only because it 's unique .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.70 0.90	poured a 341-ml bottle into a pilsner glass . appearance - very nice deep gold colour with plenty of head which quickly settles to a 1/8-inch surface foam . noticeable carbonation . smell - deep malt aromas with a creamy-brown sugar quality . some corn-veggie-hops in there as well . really looking forward to tasting . taste - full flavoured deep fire-roasted barley malt with a long but clean hop finish . on subsequent tastes it is subdued a bit by the carbonation , but also more of a subtle cream malt underneath . mouthfeel - very enjoyable borderline complex character . heavily cabonated , the only thing that takes away from the brew . drinkability - thirst-quenching and delicious . goes down very easy . not boring at all . expensive but a treat if you get some .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.60	sam adams irish red pours a deep red/ amber with two fingers of white head that fades . the aroma is dark crystal malt and earthy , almost dirty hops . the crystal dominates the flavor with lots of dark fruit . the beer is very malty without being overly sweet . the malt is balanced by a crisp bitterness and loads of earthy slightly floral hops . the finish is dry and smooth but the beer 's heaviness detracts from its drinkability .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	on tap at the haymarket brewery and pub , sunday 22 may 2011 . this pours a deep , clear red with a small offwhite head . on the nose there is a big note of raspberry with some vanilla drifting upwards , too , some caramel malt underneath those , and oak . in the mouth the raspberries and oak are the big players , with some slightly sweet malts playing nicely with the tart pear and especially the raspberries . it 's not puckeringly tart , nor is it god-awful sweet . it 's a nice balance between the two . everything seems quite well-integrated . the only real flaw for me with this beer is that it 's a bit thin , but that 's a bit nit-picky and did n't detract at all for me from this wonderful beer . this was on tap for a michigan beer day at haymarket , and i had never heard of it before and fruit beers are n't really my speed . but it looked interesting on the menu and i had to try it . i was blown away . i was even more blown away later when i saw the ratings here . like i said , i 'm not big on fruit beers , but this was a fine , fine brew .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.20	2 oz pour , '97 bottling very dark brown , opaque , and bigtime legs - impressive , unlike anything i 've had . the smell is okay - something sweet ( prunes ? ) , and something like slightly burnt wood . when i taste it , i 'm looking for maple , vanilla , and oak , but i end up with prunes and soy sauce . too sweet and slightly sour finish - i wonder if it 's gone bad , but at 17.5 % abv , with the cork in great shape , i doubt it . i think maybe they were too heavy-handed with the maple syrup when they brewed it . feel is nice and heavy , syrupy really , without any carbonation . 2 oz is about the right serving , as this one scores low on drinkability .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	sampled march 2010 a soft pour produces a fat , one-finger thick , amber tinged , tan colored head . the beer is a dark , concentrated red color that shows a clear , rich ruby hue when held up to the light . quite fruity smelling with raspberry seed notes , bright berry aromas , some light tartness , quite a bit of tannic , spicy oak . the more i inspect this the more the oak becomes apparent and the fruit falls to the background ; almost smells like a freshly cut oak plank at times . the fruit aromatics come out if i take a break from the nose ; this really is quite fruity with a spicy , fleshy raspberry , perhaps a touch of dark plum notes and some complimentary clove aromatics and brown sugar notes . quite tart tasting based on the light spiciness that was in the aroma . this has quite a bit of body to it , and it seems to have a lactic slickness to it that washes the beer off the palate ; there is also a tannic texture to this . oak flavors are perhaps the most dominant ( at least after the initial hit of lactic sourness ) , with ample peppery , oak-derived spiciness , a freshly cut wood-plank flavor , some very soft butterscotch , and maybe just a hint of vanillin . the fruit flavors are much more subdued compared to the aroma ; but still notes of rich plum , seedy raspberries and some soft berry notes are noticeable under the oak . a rich , caramelized , perhaps even maple like note mixes with oxidized , dry sherry notes and perhaps some hints of port sans sweetness . this is just a bit too over-oaked ; it gets in the way of the other flavors and can seem a bit heavy-handed at times ; having said that , if you do n't mind oak flavors , this is actually a pretty tasty brew .

0.70 0.50 0.90 0.60 0.70	a : caramel red color . thick pour with virtually no head s : strong , not so appealing , bitter/old smell t : nothing good about its taste ... nothing bad about its taste . very bitter and malty taste . m : feels good in mouth , probably because it is a thicker beer . d : since it is not that tasty it would be hard to want to drink a whole lot of this beer . it also coats the tongue with a film .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.70	review cd : 'instruments of terror ' by laika & the cosmonauts review glass : new glarus brewing co. pint glass had this handed off to me at a big uu convention up in va in july . just getting to the review now . first thing i noticed was the foam pouring out of the bottle soon as i opened it . this could get interesting . letting it sit for a few minutes before pouring was a good thing . foam was still at the mouth of the bottle , but in the glass , the head did not shoot up out of control . head is fluffy , just off-white , with a hearty honey coloured liquid under , just a touch hazy . smell is thick malt , with stale hops over the top . a little ashy quality here , too . flavour is thick , round malt , with just hint of fruity hops up top . i tend to like ipas a bit sharper and hoppier- but then , i guess i 'm getting a greater fondness for the pacnw styles . ( on second taste , there sort of a cracker-jack peanutty-caramel hint here . it 's not unpleasant . ) carbonation is just ever so slightly higher than i like . it 's not enough to drive me away , though . liquid is hearty enough to please . not the most drinakable in my book . just zigs when it should zag . your mileage may vary . be well -uf

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	corked and strapped 750ml with neck markings that are nearly illegible but suggest a bottling date of '04 . poured a dirty medium brown with a bit of fog , but not particulate matter until the last glass . head was nicely constant and the colour of burnt creme . no lace on my gulden draak tulip . smells strongly of sweet malts , new yeast , chalk , underripe bananna , slight honey , fig , overripe melon , faint spice . taste is at first salty , meaty malt , warm spice , nutty yeast . starts semi-sweet , finishes fairly dry . when warm , spiced apple cider comes to mind . this little brown lighter bodied than equivalent strongbrowns , but also had a much cleaner finish . carbonation was at hand the whole time , which was a great pleasure . booze is n't too well hidden , but is n't really that strong to begin with . a great , cheap brown .

0.70 0.80 0.20 0.30 0.30	i feel that this is one of the most overhyped beer 's on the market . i 'd heard great things before i actually tried it . it was very disappointing . if i 'm going to drink a mexican beer , i 'd prefer modelo negro . even though similar , i think it 's a good alternative .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.60	a : murky , browish-straw colour , fluffy off-white head , nice retention and lace . s : spice , citrus and a little earthy yeast . t : initially a little bland , some bready malt , spicy cloves , hints of a fruity ester ( but no discernable flavour ) , with a crisp , slightly citrous finish . m : moderate body is heavier than most . quite creamy too . carbonation is lower than average . d : a smooth introduction to the style , but it 's heavier than most , and not as refreshing .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	muddy looking hazed brown with a thin white head . this beer has a nice aroma . it 's got a light but rich caramel and wheat aroma , with slight hints of smoke and maybe some rye . the taste produces more of an earthy wheat character than the smell , with the caramel fading a bit , you can taste the rye in there too and with it some tang . got a little more smoke here than in the aroma . i really enjoyed the mouthfeel it 's a got a sligk medium body with carbonation that seems to foam in the mouth a little , making it smooth , but unique . a decent quirky beer , and definitely the best of the brewer patriot collection .

0.40 0.50 0.20 0.30 0.30	a - pours with a decent one finger head . in typical saranac fashion , it dissipated in under a minute . it is a slightly hazy orange . as in a tang , or other orange drink , orange . s - there is a bit of good and bad . i can get faint cloves and bananas , but mostly a stale grain odor dominates . t - faint bananas accompanied by a strange musky bitterness . the aftertaste is entirely a really gross stale grain flavor . it makes me think of stale cherrios . not good at all . it does n't really go away either . m - thin , drying , the lining of my mouth started feeling odd . it starts to feel like i 've been eating chalk after a bit , and with that aftertaste it is an entirely conceivable scenario . d - ugh . i 'll pass in the future . i ca n't think that this would go well with anything . it is easily the worst belgian i have had to date . maybe i 'd go for it again if i ever have a craving for cherrios , chalk and bananas , but i 'd probably just bust out the blender . 1.5 here because i could actually finish it .

0.20 0.30 0.50 0.40 0.20	honey , apples juice , a few bubbles , and virtually no head what so ever . not much to look at . grapes , honey , and alcohol . i do n't recall honey being in the mix here , but i 'm certainly getting a sweet note similar to it . reminds me of a fruity white wine . interesting ... but not sure what to think of it . a huge alcohol kick , then white wine and a sweet flavor i can not place . i have no idea what saffron is so i 'll go with that ? wow this is only 9 % ? i would have guessed 12-13 % at least , maybe even 15 % . an awful job hiding the alcohol . this beer has just a touch of carbonation , burns , and is pretty darn thick . not really creamy . i had this a few years ago when it first came out , was n't a fan then but it 's been years so i figured i should try again . well ... umm seems first responses do n't always change . a huge applause for the work that dogfish put into this . you can tell from the start they really worked hard to make this stuff . sadly it 's just not for me .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	clear brown in color , soft creamy head . light caramel nutty aroma , good nutty flavor , light body a little too light , and a bit watery , not a bad brown ale but not the best , easy to drink one , more than that would be too much .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	2004 vintage 8.5 oz bottle . poured a thick opaque brown with hints of red . absolutely no head at all , nor any lacing . no carbonation bubbles . it looked pretty much like apple cider . there was a little bit of visual entertainment when a bit of the sediment fell in , but after that , it was pretty tame . aroma consists mainly of fruit . it 's very , very sweet . almost like a syrup . notes of cherry , grape , apple , caramel , fig , and plum . taste is bursting with the flavor that the nose promised . mouthfeel is pretty thick , with absolutely minimal carbonation . definitely a sipper . i prefer my beers much more carbonated than this usually , but this one certainly has its place . i look forward to seeing how the other seven i have mature over the years .

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60	got this at de bierkoning in amsterdam . from a bomber into a snifter . appearance : pours a huge , three finger , thinner looking , off-white head with good retention . very fluffy head . clear , bright amber-orange color with medium carbonation evident . head eventually fades to a thick foamy cap . a good foam cap remains and leaves some chunky , unappealing lace down the sides . head is a little to thin and chunky for the style . needs to tighten up its game . smell : pale malts , floral hops and some light citrus notes . quite the bouquet of flowers on this one . hints of melon and some green fruit , like apples and pear . this is like a dipa and a triple had a kid . quite interesting for sure , but not quite to style . taste : pale malts with plenty of floral hops and citrus notes . sweet melon rides out the middle and introduces some bitter grapefruit on the finish . not much green fruit like in the nose ; more of a dipa here . a long , bold , bitter grapefruit and floral aftertaste is hoppy and tasty . palate : lighter body and higher levels of carbonation . light and fluffy on the palate , plenty creamy and smooth , goes down fine and finishes slightly mouth coating . some warming alcohol on the finish , which was unexpected for the lower abv . unfortunately it 's still too light and carbonated for the style . does n't support the promising flavors enough . overall : not really impressed with this one . body was too light and overly carbonated , which did n't support the main act enough , and the head was anything but appealing for the style . pouring the yeast into the glass at the end of the bottle helped liven the body up a bit , but this offering was still somewhat disappointing . there are other great beers by alesmith , but this year 's summer relase does n't quite measure up .

0.90 0.60 0.80 0.40 0.50	12 oz bottle pours thick and black with a thick head coffee like . scent of chocolate and yeast . this is a typical english stout with a type of yeast i ca n't stand . i would n't reccomend this compared to the other wonderful stouts out there . maybe on tap this is better or maybe the bottle i bought was old not sure but very dissapointed .

0.50 0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80	appearance- very bubbly cloudy pale orange body with white head that quickly disolves and leaves no lacing . smell- strong citrus smell with wheat in the background , flowery smell can be faintly dected also taste- very smooth wheat taste with citrus accents . the aftertaste is a little sour but is consistant with the initial taste . mouth feel- highly overcarbonated which almost hides the great taste drinkability- it tastes good and finishes clean which makes it very drinkable . i have been dabating whether to rate this beer on its own or as a representation of the belgian white . this beer is very popular and is available on draft at most bars where they add an orange slice . its a great alternative to the macro or light lager which is often the only other beers they have available on draft . on its own this stands proud above other common american beers . that being said-this beer is n't a solid example of a belgian white . i get annoyed when i am enjoying witbier and the bartender comments that it is similar to blue moon . it is highly overcarbonated and does n't have the typical light taste of a witbier .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	a lovely golden brew with a nice white head and just a touch of lace . blueberries hit the nose right away with a touch of malt sweetness and mild hop spiciness . taste is golden ale with a light toasted malt nuttiness and a touch of biscuit . the blueberries ride atop the sweetness of the malt and flow throughout the structure of the beer . finish is clean with mild hops and light berry notes that linger . maybe a touch of bubblegum . feel is crisp with a medium light weight . a nice beer to change the pace with especially during the warmer months . while not my first pick in this category not my last either .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.30 0.40	poured from a 22oz bottle into a wine glass , as suggested on the bottle . this brew pours a fairly hazy deep amber color with fairly apparent carbonation . head is minimal . aroma is primarily spicy ginger , sugar , and yeastiness . the taste follows , it 's surely a sweet ginger bomb . yeastiness and a bit of hop presence back it up . i think it 's just a little too cloying for my tastes , the ginger and sweetness are oppressive , and the fact that yeastiness is backing them up does n't help this beer 's case much . that said , it 's obviously well-constructed , but it seriously tastes a bit like vomit to me . the mouthfeel is very nice , it 's very carbonated which works with the ginger presence , and the mouthfeel is at about a medium thickness . overall ? it 's a probably decent beer , just not for me . i just ca n't seem to put this to my mouth as often as i 'd like . it 's got interesting , complex flavors for sure , but they 're just not ticking the right boxes for me to love this . drainpoured about half of the bottle . still , worth a try , since i 'm pretty sure it 's a love it or hate it beer .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50	appearance : orange-red-amber pour , small head , no lacing . smell : i have no clue what frankincense and myrrh are supposed to taste or smell like , but i do n't get anything that would be fit for a king . i do get some caramel malts an faint spiceness . taste : certainly a biere de garde , not my preferred style . also not my favorite beer from that style . bit of funk , caramel , toffee , brown bread , and spice . mouthfeel : best part of the beer , nice medium-heavy weight and a good creaminess . not one to try a second time .

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.50 0.50	poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass . freshness date of 35906fx , whatever that means . golden orange hued with a tiny head that leaves minimal lacing . lots of floaties around the beer , i assume they are yeast . aroma is biscuity malts and citrus hops . taste is kind of lacking . quite sweet even with a hop smack . a nice malt backbone accompanies hoppiness making it a pretty balanced beer . light to medium body . the only other imp pils i have had is sam adams . in my opinion , this doesnt compare overall . not as complex , but still tasty .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	12 oz `` bard 's tale ... dragon 's gold '' obtained from john 's grocery in feb 2005 and consumed that same evening . poured a faint white head that quickly settled to a ring around the glass . a couple strems of bubbles raced through the crystal clear light dull-yellow liquid . not quite a light straw color , more like paper grocery bag color , but a few shades lighter . smells earthy and musty with a bit of tangy hop . tastes quite hoppy to start that 's chased by a dark rich malty with wins out about halfway through . it leaves a sugary rounded flavor in my mouth afterwards . interesting , it goes from bitter hoppy start to a kind of sweet mushroomy ( in a good way , mind you ) that changes into a floral ending . this is definitely a complex beer . the flavors stick as this beer is md to md-tick bodied and hangs on the tongue . nioce job . i was worried when i saw how light the color was and the streams of carbonation that i 'd get a weak acrid experience . instead the later sweet balances the initial hop umph well , ending sweet again , if somewhat dry . this is the first gluten free beer i 've ever seen and i found it quite enjoyable . if the distribution were wider , celiacs the world over would be forced to stop complaining about the lack of a gluten-free beer product .

0.70 0.50 0.30 0.40 0.40	the colour is pale yellow ; the two finger head is white and firm . the smell is mild with a malty flavour with some coffee and a hint of honey . it is a bit artificial . the taste is light with a salty note of artificial malt , minerals ( as so often in hungarian beers ) . the somewhat sweet aftertaste got somewhat roasted notes of coffee grounds and hop flavourings . there are almost no bitter notes at all . the carbonation is on the lighter side with small bubbles . this one is very easy to drink . but that goes for water too .

0.80 0.30 0.70 0.30 0.30	i 'm not sure if pacific rim is actually still in business anymore . the taproom is still open and people do show up to drink beers . but of their six regular beers , they 're out of five . and they advertise music four nights a week , but there was n't any as scheduled when i visited on a friday . there 's also a big , hand lettered sign behind the bar reading , `` i know nothing . '' i asked the bartender about it . she knew nothing . if the brewery is indeed in decline , this uncommonly foul beer may be the cause or consequence of it . pacific rim either brews extremely bad beers such as this , which has caused business to wane , or else the near-termination of their operation has resulted in only aging , mediocre ales now served far past their prime . honestly , it 's uncommon to be served a beer this wretched . visually , it was clouded golden with good lace and a slight head courtesy of wheat and rye adjuncts . but in tasting it , i first noted peculiar vegetative qualities along the lines of spinach and celery . i finally determined that the beer tasted like liquefied sauerkraut . there were strong elements of vinegar and sour lime that made driftwood tortuous to consume . just painful . this poor beer should have been poured down the drain sometime before last christmas .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	tap at the super sweet cascade barrel house ... it was about time i got my mitts on this infamously hyped beer . poured clear amber/orange with a white head . the nose was candied , quite sweet with a light yeast funk . the lacto is so clean compared to brett , which definitely is displayed in a lot of the cascade sours . some acidity going on , maple sweet sugars , lactic yeast notes , quite sour and tart . ginger , apples , light fruit . like a tart , slightly over ripped fruit with a lot of added sweetness .

0.60 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.40	a - cloudy dark copper / auburn with one finger of tan head that leaves no lacing behind . s - powerful pine hops and a bit of whole wheat crackers with a caramel malt backbone . t - there is a strong pine flavor upfront . it is almost too crisp . there is a bit of caramel malt flavor and a discernable nuttiness as well . the aftertaste is a strong lingering pine bitterness . i ca n't find too much depth here . m - medium viscosity , it is bitter enough to make my mouth water after drinking it , so it is refreshing then . d - an easy drinking brew . too strong to session and i ca n't think of foods that would go with it . another style hop bombed by victory . it is a good beer , like all victory beers , but it seems to be , again , one-dimensional . victory lives in the hop dimension .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	one for the cellars ! i opened a bottle from batch 79 and complexity and intrigue flowed out . appearance : strong thick white foam stands resilient over a hazy mysterious dark golden brew laced with beckoning red hues . decent lacing for a 10 % beer . smell : a very unique combo of aromas pickled my nose into confusion . apple juice , berries , pear , toasted malt and bubblegum dart around sporadically but all are permeated by a complex hop aroma that seems to hold everything together like glue . taste : alcoholic and sweet with a peppy carbonation , this brew tastes like fruit and candy with a sweet and honey like finish . hard to believe there are 65 ibu 's in here as i long for a bit more bitterness . mouthfeel : amazing . creamy and smooth , thick . drinkability : a bit too sweet and cloying to be considered highly drinkable , however fred does okay in this category for its style .

0.80 0.60 0.30 0.40 0.40	is n't the can of wittekerke ros awesome ? you 'd think the slender 8.4 ounce can was some kind of energy drink that donates a portion of the proceeds to breast cancer . instead , it is a raspberry infused witbier . did i mention the raspberry was artifical flavor ? on to the beer : well , the color of the beer has a raspberry infused orange color to it , hazy . the head color has a pink tint to it , and it has surprisingly good head retntion and forms good patchy lace . it kind of smells like raspberries , and it 's not bad at all . maybe i was wrong about this beer ... ... .or maybe not . it tastes like lightly flavored cough syrup to me , which is n't the worst taste in the world , but it sure does n't taste like beer . i can also taste a bit of iron . come to think of it , it does kind of taste like a raspberry energy drink . it feels sticky in the mouth like one , and as a beer i prefer it did n't . well ... i managed to get all 8.4 ounces down of this 4.3 % abv drink . it sure is n't as fun to drink as wittekerke w/o all the added shit , but what other alcoholic beverage out there can you get for less than red bull , yet who 's label looks like an energy drink ? this must be good for drinking in public places and driving .

0.50 0.40 0.20 0.30 0.40	are you afraid of the dark ? maybe you should be . pours a darker brownish color that is mostly hazy . a quick disappearing head and no lace . the nose has a slight smell of malt . some burnt astringent notes with a light toffee backing . som off yeast notes with a little bit of buytric . some oxidation notes as well . the taste is also limited . there is a watery taste and had little to no body . the presence of malt was limited where there should be a strong german influence . a more us feel for both malt and yeast . the body is really lacking . overall this is very limited beer with not much to it .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	2004 bottle cracked at a tasting . this poured a cola color with some red/burgundy edges . there was a little ring of head that remained and decent lacing noted . nose was pure fresh vanilla beans . i did not smell like artificial vanilla but the whole bean variety . very strong , vibrant smell . taste followed suit , heavy vanilla up front . there was some malt in the mid palate to balance the vanilla , but this leaves no doubt that it is a vanilla porter . the mouthfeel was a bit watery which could be due to the fact it is only 4.8 % and thus not alot of malt was apparently used , but i think it held up well over time , although i have not tried this fresh so i can not compare . this was an easy drinker if you like vanilla . i would love to try one of these fresh .

0.60 0.90 0.60 1.00 1.00	according to the bartender at roots , mother pucker was their trippel , aged in a pinot gris barrel , that mistakenly soured , presumably from bacteria resident in the barrel . supposedly only a sixtel ( 5 gal ) was made . tapped earlier this week , she doubted it would still be around by the end of the weekend . i 'm not sure i buy the idea that a wine-maker would use so small a barrel , but regardless of the exact back-story on how it came to be , the description fit the beer to a tee . hopefully she 's wrong though and they have more on deck ... if not , i feel very lucky to have gotten to try this beer , as i do n't get to drop into roots nearly as often as i 'd like . anyways ... served in a chalice , the color is a clear dark gold with only a wisp of a white collar . aroma is fantastic , soft , sour lactic nose , lemons and pinot gris , from mild to moderate as it warms . from the first whiff i knew i 'd love this beer . yum ! taste is just plain awesome - pinot gris meets lambic ! i should note any semblance of a trippel has been obliterated by the aforementioned effects of the barrel aging , but that for me is a very good thing indeed . very vinous , crisp acidity , honey and lemon rind , a funky mother pucker for sure ! in spite of all the flavor , it 's really not too overwhelming , in the way a pure gueze might be for those unaccustomed to wild brews . i credit that to the pinot gris , which is very notable - i wonder how much was left in the barrel , especially if it was only a sixtel ? the alcohol is certainly noticable , but again is more like the richness of wine at that abv , which is much cleaner tasting then the fusels you often find in big beers . mouthfeel is slick and on the thicker side . a sugar coating forms on the teeth after a few sips , much like , you guessed it , drinking wine ! drinkability is so high roots had to impose a limit of 2 smaller chalices per customer ! absolutely fantastic , i really enjoyed my two servings , and would 've had no problem with a third . but i understand that if it really is so limited , it needs to be shared . i can also recognize that it may be to rich and strong for plenty of folks . but it was exactly to my taste , and i 'm just really glad i got to try it . i really hope roots tries to reproduce this 'mistake ' in bigger quantities , it 's got to be one of the best beers i 've had in memory , or dare i say ever ? ? wow !

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 1.00	a - thin head but plenty of bubbles , very clear dark light amber ( or dark gold ) s - honey and oats , very rich and seductive t - the classic bitter of a good pils with a floral notes . biscuit-like sweetness gives way to a dry , earthy aftertaste . complex . earthy flavors give way to a sustained sweetness with a classic pils bittering . m - smooth and sticky d - top notch , for anybody who loves a beer that reminds them of a good bread .

0.80 0.90 0.50 0.80 0.50	arcadia cocoa loco is a brown/black beer with a dense light brown head that fades to a film and leaves excellent lacing . it has a roasty aroma with notes of chocolate , coffee and licorice . it 's smooth and full bodied with a scratchy , chalky finish . it has a nice , roasty flavor . it tastes just like the aroma . there 's some sweetness to it and the bitter finish seems to come from the chocolate . it would be awesome if it was n't so tongue shredding .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	pours a hazy chestnut brown in color with a creamy/foamy 2 finger head that lasted a while and was pretty thick ; it looks like a glass of coke with great foamy lacing that clings to the glass . smells of sweet malt , nut , toasted grains , syrup , caramel , brown sugar and light floral hops . nice sweet nose . tastes of sweet malt , nut , toasted grains , syrup , caramel , molasses , brown sugar , yeast , charcoal or burnt wood and light floral hops ; pretty complex for a brown ale and well balanced . mouthfeel is smooth , crisp and almost watery , with medium carbonation and a medium body . good drinkability , especially for fans of malty beers . a solid brown ale that 's worth trying , and i 'm not huge in the brown ale world yet . i find most brown ales on the boring side , but this one was one of the better browns that i 've had and well above average .

0.80 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.60	appearance : the beer is cloudy with a small white head . the head sticks around for a while before settling to a thin white film on the surface of the beer . there 's some spotty lacing as the beverage is drained . smell : this is easily the least potent smelling drink i 've had in the entire ipa family of styles . there 's no malts and really only a tiny smack of bitter hops . it 's really kind of shocking since i find the mojo standard to be a pretty damn good ipa overall . taste and mouthfeel : again i 'm pretty disappointed , this beer drinks a little bland . up front there 's some citrus hop bitterness which transfers in to a touch of malt sweetness but then it 's over aside for some bitterness in to the aftertaste . the mouthfeel is n't too bad though . there 's a good base of carbonation to back an otherwise smooth drinking beer . to this beer 's merit , the alcohol is very well hidden though at 10 % . drinkability : if the flavors were a little more rich and the smell was a little more potent then this would have been one of the more drinkable dipas i 've ever had given its good mouthfeel and ability to quell the 10 % abv . unfortunately the beer is kind of a yawn and that hurts the drinkability . bottom line : i had really high hopes for this beer because i really enjoy the mojo and their hazed and infused but this was a really unimpressive beer for me and i ca n't allow pedigree to boost the score . not boulder brewing 's best beer by a long shot .

0.80 1.00 0.70 0.90 1.00	pours a hazy medium yellow/gold with a nice head that evaporates at quick rate . smell is of bananas , citrus , fruity , cantaloupe , yeast , spices , etc ... one of the best noses i have ever experienced in a beer . exceptional . as for the taste , it 's right up there as well . much like the nose , it tastes of bananas , yeast , honey dew melon , some spiciness that would be expected from this genre of beers , just party in my mouth . mouthfeel is decent , creamy yet maybe a little too carbonated . for a 7.7 % brew , this is extremely drinkable - even too drinkable . hennepin is so tasty and refreshing , and hides the alcohol level extremely well so be responsible downing these gems .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.20 0.20	described on the menu as an `` imperial witte '' , how could i not try it ? i asked the barkeep which was better : this or 3 amigos ( their belgian strong pale ) . top class - he gave me sample glasses of each , mentioning that he though the 3 amigos was better . he was very fucking correct . this witte had a lot of problems , none of which were evident by it 's appearance . the smell was pure sour apple , lots of fusals , perhaps evidence of contamination . even worse was the taste . it was barely palatable : very little carbonation - full of sour , gone-bad notes . not enjoyable . this is an error that the good brewers of brew it up should have kept to themselves .

0.60 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.80	oh god this has to be the worst beer ever , is this even a beer . i can just imagine 300 union workers chugging a decent beer and pissing this into a huge fermenter . a : this one could easily pass as piss . pretty piss though ? ! s : yep this one could definitely pass for 'piss ' . t : cheap carbonated corn . is it common to use the lord 's name in vain after every sip of beer ? m : if it werent for the bottle this beer would have sunk years ago . d : it 's cheap as hell what would you expect ? like i said if it werent for the bottle it comes in and the price , why would anybody drink this ? ?

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60	served from a 22 oz . bomber into a 16 oz kopparberg cider glass . wanted a tall pour to watch my beloved ny giants take on the 11-0 packers . appears an apricot orange with no shade of brown in it at all . there 's a big fluffy one inch head despite a conservative pour and giving it time to settle . it smells of apricots and honey . light and tropical . i do pick up a faint woody tone ... apparently we 're oaked here . there 's something strange about the flavor oaks . it has a wang to it that 's reminiscent of overcooked asparagus . it 's not hop bitterness either . it 's coming from the malt . musty . mouthfeel is heavier than i 'd anticipate . not for the genre ... more along the lines of from sam . i wish i liked the flavor of this because its heaviness is spot on . overall i 'm not happy here . there 's no coming back from bad flavor . would n't get this again . would n't want to drink it again .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.60	have had this bottle downstairs for about six months or so and figured i 'd crack it open to share at a friend 's pre-wedding gathering . shared with several non-connoisseurs ... but kept half for myself ! poured into the portsmouth snifter that will remain at kate 's for the next two years . man this thing was carbonated . nice fluffy pink-hued head with about one-finger of beer . this thing frothed up quickly ! literally , poured about and eight of the snifter and the very fluffy loosely-packed head poked out of the top of the glass . dozens of tiny maroon specks graced the surface of the head ... interesting . a small amount of lace is left behind . the actual beer is a darker pink color ; it looks like a blush wine . there are plenty of particulates floating around . the smell of brett is immediately obvious . there are some gentle sweeter fruits in there was well , but honestly i ca n't discern exactly what they are . i 'm still getting all of my senses back after battling a cold . the sour smell is definitely there . based solely on the nose , i expected there to be more flavor than there was . the funkiness is definitely there but the rest of the taste is very distant . there is still some of the sweetness that the nose insinuates , but again , it is mild . tastes softly of berries and a hint of vinegar . also difficult to get past is the very carbonated fizziness that certainly detracts . i guess it is well documented that this beer has the potential to gush a bit - it definitely detracts from the mouthfeel . the tart and sour are there , but subdued . the finish is very dry . drank half of the bottle , but had some trouble solely because of the seltzer-like carbonation . i thought the champagne was going to be after the wedding . not a bad beer , but a bit watered down from what i was anticipating . hopefully goose island will continue to mess around with sours ... there are n't that many options here in the midwest ! consumed : 6/5/2010

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	was served the nut brown ale in a pint glass at the dining room of el tovar hotel , overlooking the grand canyon . spectacular view of the canyon , however , it did n't improve the appearance score one bit . otherwise , it 'd be a 10.0 . but the beer came looking like a black beauty with a burnt tan head . reminds me of guinness but without the nitro-bubbles cascading down . aroma was nice , roasted malts , nutty aroma , and just a joy to smell . could n't wait to start drinking the beer - especially with the roasted-nutty flavor emanating from the glass . taste lived up to the promise that the aroma made . i was not disappointed . nice nutty flavor , smoothly blended with roasted malts to create a marriage of flavor that just works . mouthfeel was the weak area - it got a bit thin towards the end , especially after the head went away . if the head was bigger or had more lasting power , the mouthfeel would be scored higher . even with the head though , it was n't much more than average . a bit of creaminess from the head and then smoothness . there was n't much body to it . drinkability was excellent . would easily drink this one again if i could get access to it again . would also search this out again , it was easily sessionable and smooth-drinking , if you manage to gun it down before the head goes away . but it is n't a world-class beer , just a very solid beer that 's very enjoyable .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.60	appearance : pours a clear , copper body with a small , fizzy white head . smell : perfumy aroma of wet , leafy hops with notes of sugar-crusted grapefruit . taste : light maltiness upfront , with a taste of toasted grains and only a hint of sweetness . strong grapefruit rind flavor . plenty of bitterness , but never too much to stray far from the light malt base . finishes dry , with a lightly lingering bitterness . mouthfeel : medium-thin body . medium carbonation . drinkability : it 's a decent brew that walks the line between ipa and double ipa .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.70 0.70	looks like an imperial russian stout in the glass . light proof black beer with a tall brown colored head . the smell is sweet and boozy with a lot of chocolate and vanilla with a scotch whiskey edge to it . smokiness is restrained but present and this one does not run you over with the whiskey truck . the taste begins roasted malt and chocolate flavor with a solid bitterness . after the initial taste some of the more complex whiskey and malt flavors become apparent . malt is upstaged by the roasted malt flavors here and it tastes like a whiskey barrel ris to me . chocolate , smoke , vanilla and coffee are the major flavors . lesser players are pretty much not in here . talk about mouthfeel this is quite close to drinking pancake batter thick . quite a nice beer but this is really a ris . drink this when you want a ris and you will love it .

0.70 0.60 0.60 0.80 1.00	bottle inspection : date code on back 40y made from all barley malt . aroma : slightly sweet malt base and a good yeast nose . some of the woody characteristics the bjcp tells me to look for , but i wouldnt have caught it on my own . appearance : amber glass capped with a light tan creamy head that laced . clarity good . flavor : hops really pop in the taste . id say pale ale , but the woody taste really makes a difference . it is slightly minty . there is a firm malt base that accents the hops nicely . mouthfeel : body is light medium , carbonation level is fairly high , has a nice smooth texture and a lingering tingle . overall impression : a good summer beer . easy to drink , a little filling for a session , but i could see this being a crowd pleaser . give it a try !

0.60 0.70 0.30 0.60 0.60	pours an off-white , one-finger head that vanishes instantly leaving no lace . nearly clear amber color . almost no carbonation and medium bodied . nose is a citrus hop . starts with a good mix of malts and hops , the hops dominate , lingering hoppy aftertaste . the lack of carbonation is not typical , we had some grail from a keg at the brewery which was much better . $ 5 for a 1 liter bottle tapped from the tank at the brewery littleton , nh .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	shout out to wchesak for this one ! poured in tost continent tulip glass . pours a thick dark burgundy with a great light tan head . the aroma i sweet malt with a distinct red smell to it . the mouthfeel on this beer is great , so creamy with just enough bubbles that make it not to syrupy . the flavor is great . starts out sweet and then goes into a heavier malt backbone and finishes with a great hope bitter finish . a really great imperial red , would n't mine more of this one !

0.60 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.80	poured a pale amber , not used to seeing this tone , not much head smell : malt , piney smell . taste : malt , light hops , bit of sweetness , nicely balanced by the hops , complex flavor , hints of wood , or pine , perhaps a bit of fruit as well . mouthfeel : not impressed pretty watery , nice little bubbles on the tongue , a tiny bit of chewiness . drinkability : overall pretty good , this is quite a bit different than other oktoberfests i 've tried , but i would say it does capture the mood of autumn , i would drink it again .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.90 0.80	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass . a : cloudy , dark golden color . very slight carbonation bubbles . leaves an initial thick , frothy head , and then tapers down to a 3/8 '' head that lasts throughout the glass . light lacing . s : sweet , fruity smell . t : sweet and nice hop to malt balance . m : moderately thick , leaves a slimy feeling on roof of mouth . d : goes down quite smooth . could have one or two without overindulging .

0.60 0.20 0.20 0.30 0.40	first off , let me say i am reviewing this for the folly of it all . i got it from my fridge and who knows where it came from or how long it had been there . a . poured from a 12 oz can into a frosted mug . palest yellow with some head that sticks around and shows some lace . not a terrible start . s. takes a dive in the smell . smells like garbage . the kind thats been sitting out for quite some time . i 'm in for a bad one . t. extremely light . a watered down beer experience . starts off grainey with a bit of a corn taste , a slight bitter note is barely noticed which must be some sad attempt to hop this beer . finishes off slightly metallic . m. just like water . a bit bubbly like watered down seltzer water . d. this can be drank and is by a devoted crowd of poor college kids . i am not impressed . in fact , i 'm disappointed ... .in myself ... for drinking this .

0.80 0.30 0.80 0.40 0.40	a-dark ruby . big tan head . fairly clear s-metalic . wet hay . no hops . medicinal . some toast . t-toasty malts . munichy . saccarine sweet . not at all sour . not even like an oud bruin with sweet sour . just nothing . maybe a little skittle flavor from some lacto but not much . m- medium bodied . a little tanic but ok . medium carbonation . d-while i would n't call this beer awful , it definetly is n't a ( according to the label ) oak-aged sour flemish style red ale . the fake sweetness/wortiness is already getting on my nerves ( 4 sips in ) . shame , i love most 2 brothers and urthel beers .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60	appearance- pours a very dark brown , almost opaque , with barely any light peeking through on the edges of the glass . head starts off fizzy tan , then creams up into a lingering/lacey ring . aroma- burnt caramel , pumpernickel breadiness , soft smoke , powdery cocoa , and a touch of herbal hops . inviting , rich , and intriguing . flavor- bigger than expected herbal hop flavor and bitterness with raw cocoa to start . sweet , deep molasses and dark caramel round out the middle . finishes with a slightly boozy , acrid bite that is mellowed by the nice addition of mouthfeel-enhancing lactose . an interesting aftertaste lingers with notes of cocoa , herbal hops , and dark roasted malt . mouthfeel- full bodied with a creamy texture from the lactose . sticky with residual sugar . low-medium co2 , decent balance for a beefier brew . overall- big brew with a lot going on . drinkability suffers a bit because of it . feel like some time in the cellar might do it well . tasty though with some fun mouthfeel thanks to their adjuncts ! cocoa and molasses are evident , but not overwhelming . if i see any more out and about i will lay a bottle or two down for a while to see if the flavors meld together a little better with some time !

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60	12oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass . i had this one awhile ago , but i remember it perfectly , bc i was let down . pours a brown on the lighter side , really not much head or lacing . smells promising w/ hints of chocolate and coffee . tastes pretty watered down.. subtle and plain . mouthfeel is very watery w/ average crabonation . there 's no body to this beer ! with all of the problems above , it 's makes it kind of hard to drink.. but i had no problem finishing it of course . i had high expectations , so i suppose that 's why i graded it so harshly , it hurts . i like thirsty dog , they do some really good stuff.. but this is a complete miss . old leghumper has no characteristics that i look for in a porter.. it 's definitely not robust . in the world of porters , i ca n't recommend this one .

0.80 1.00 0.70 1.00 1.00	one of the better porters i 've had . color : dark but transluecent . smell : roast nut and chocolate , very inviting . the rye reminds me of bourben which i also like , but the beer taste does not . taste : flavor explosion , hints of chocolate , roast malt , somewhat bready without thichness , perfect balance of sweetness and hop bitterness without being overpowering in either . mouthfeel : could be a little thicker with more carbination . head really never formed and beer left a thin lace on the glass . drinkability : goes down easy , could be a session beer . first beer i 've had from flat earth ... i 'll definately come back for more cygnus x-1 purchased in bomber at rum river liquor . abv 6.5 %

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	this brew is on the mediocre side once it 's past your eyes . faint citrus hop aroma with bits of grain and fruit . thin body holds a minimal malt spine and finishes like a green apple and hop tea . certainly not one of the best american wheats i 've tried , and considering the price , i wo n't be trying again .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	dark garnet with some coppery highlights around the edges , richer shades of red/brown in the middle ; the color is quite attractive . beige head , at the apex the foam was a half finger tall ; head retention was decent the bubbles faded to a soapy collar after a few moments . subsequent lacing was spotty and unorganized . still , overall , this is an attractive beer great color ! rich malty nose ; hints of caramel and chocolate , which surprising me in a red ale , is the stars . the bouquet is also fairly fruity with suggestions of apples and raisins . quite hops , as desired . while the nose is not complex the combination of the malty attributes and fruitiness are excellent . i wish the potency was a tad louder but the aromas are quite inviting nevertheless ! for a basic , not tricked out , red ale i would call the bouquet exceptional . the palate isnt sweet but plenty malty with a good bit of caramel flavors as well as some nuttiness and chocolate . dark fruits and apples arrive in the middle ; linger a bit before fading to some chocolate nuttiness . tasty ! clean ending , kind of abrupt but , thankfully , the aftertaste is mouth-coating with plenty of remnants from the palate . i must say , i really like this beer . for a no-frills red ale it is excellent . imo , it is a cross between a red & brown ale . topnotch ! not quite medium in body , fairly firm , low carbonation ; the mouthfeel is a bit watery and thin . i can live with it . drinkable , indeed i am quite impressed . of the three beers i was fortunate enough to try from this brewery this is by far the best offering . i wish more red ales had this much character . sure , it could be improved upon ( better mouthfeel , better ending on the palate , and maybe a tickle more sweetness ) but , still , this is a very good beer . id be happy to drink this regularly . thanks ahatcher78 for my first three wv beers !

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60	picked up a bottle while i was in chicago for dark lord day . poured into my mini-stein a : pours a straw yellow with a thin white head that recedes quickly . plenty of carbonation s : buttery , light malt sweetness , mild earthy hop character . definitely more butteriness that i like t : buttery , light , crisp , mild noble hop flavor . not really much going on that i can discern m : this is one category where this beer does well with a nice light feel and pleasant carbonation d : why would i want another ? i doubt that this style is as poor as this beer is - i 'm going to have to look for another

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	got this one from todd1 in a trade a little while ago . thanks ! after a bit of wrangling , i managed to break the cork in half . some quick work with a corkscrew removed the rest . it immediately started foaming , to the point of just cresting over the lip of the bottle . a very gentle pour yielded a big fluffy off-white head that fell very slowly . it was a bit rocky and left clumpy chunks on the glass . the beer was a bit hazy and was closer to orange than amber in colour . very bready in the aroma , white bread crusts , biscuits , wheat crackers , a bit of caramel . fruity too , with notes of pear and apple skin , apricots . there was a light citrus element as well , with a hint of yeast that appeared as it warmed . the flavour fell mostly into the malty/fruity combo too . bread , toast , and more caramel sweetness than in the aroma . pear and apple with stone fruits , ripe . alcohol flavour hit mid-palate and there was a faint grassy and floral kick towards the end . the finish was lightly spicy with lingering fruit and caramel . medium bodied with carbonation that was a little too high and too coarse for my liking , but it did n't turn me off completely . warmth from the alcohol and off-dry . pretty tasty overall . my only issue was the carbonation .

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	pours deep red amber with a one finger off white head . fair amount of sticky lacings . aroma is caramel and floral hops . taste is sweet rich malts with some earthy bitterness . many sips later all i can taste is an overpowering sweetness . judging by the date on the bottle this brew is about 100 days old . maybe too long and poorly stored to be good . this is the first lagunitas product that has been a disappointment . if i ever visit the brewery or find this on tap somewhere i will have a taste to see if i had an non typical pour . this was a 22 ounce bottle i it was difficult to finish the second half . hard to believe this could be 72 ibus , tasted more like 35 .

0.80 0.40 0.20 0.20 0.20	one word , `` blah '' . i thought only eggnog should have that much vanilla . it looked promising when the bar keep brought it , dark and rich looking . but all taste was eclipsed by the vanilla . it was a chore just to drink it . avoid this beer , unless you are some kind of eggnog `` junkie '' .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	straw colored , small fading head and lots of bubbles . not really any smell , a bit of grain mostly corn . taste is really watery , but has a bit of corn sweetness and is very smooth . body is very light with lots of carbonation . drinks very easily . beer pong ?

0.40 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.80	pale yellow brew with an almost greenish-grey hue . soapy dishwater head only lasts a minute before subsiding to a collar of white suds . there is a decent amount of lace , and the bottle is really cool . but this is still a relatively unattractive beer . the nose is full of rice and a general fruity flavor that 's hard to place . slightly floral and sweet like a flower garden . tastes unique , that 's for sure . does n't really taste ... good per say , but it 's different . that counts for something . tastes like rice paper with a strange spicyness in the background . the finish is very and peppery . this beer is weak and not very complex , but what flavor it does offer is very bizzare and foreign to my taste buds . that 's not a bad thing , but it 's just weird tasting . this one is highly carbonated and very thin , but the bottle says `` crisp , clear , refreshing '' and that it is ! i gave it a pretty high mouthfeel score due to the very unique , highly carbonated , and super dry feel . i kinda like it in this aspect ! this is slaking my summer thirst quite well , and it 's altogether not a bad beer , but it 's just different . like other reviewers , i have a strong feeling that this would pair extremely well with the delicate flavors of sashimi .

0.60 0.60 0.50 0.80 0.70	12 oz . bottle into a clear party cup ( all my glasses are dirty ) . a- dark gold with a creamy white head . s- a very unique aroma , some mild hops , a little bit of caramel . t- this pale ale is very different from other interpretations of the style i 've had . that might be because it is an english pale ale , a style i am not as familiar with . the first thing i noticed was its creaminess . more malt than i am used to in a pale ale with mild hops . i also taste some caramel . m- very creamy , kind of thick . d- while not necessarily my first choice for a session beer bass is very drinkable and would be a solid choice for sessioning .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	2011 bottle . appearance : jet black with deep brown 1/2 inch head . held up to light and could not see through . pretty darn opaque . smell : rich chocolate and bourbon . not as much roastiness as i would expect in a stout of this color . taste : more sweet chocolate and bourbon . paired with some chocolate and it really made the bourbon stand out . not the alcohol bite of drinking straight bourbon but the complex woody character was definitely there . mouthfeel : very smooth and drinkable for a beer over 10 % abv . had to keep myself from gulping it all down so i could taste it as it warmed up to room temperature . overall : awesome beer . i generally prefer a little more roastiness in an imperial stout , but i feel like they held back the roastiness in order to let the bourbon shine through . i bought two so that i could age one and i 'm excited to try it again in a year or so .

0.70 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	slides into the glass a tan colour with that lovely murky beginning common to all 'creamy ' beers . the flavour is similar to the heavier tennents offering , the 70 shilling , but without such strong malt or hops flavours . the real joy of this beer is the mouthfeel . so creamy and smooth it 's almost not a beer ...

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.70	thanks to discovolante65 for the 22oz bottle , with odd almost demented label artwork . a quadruple with dried plums . batch two , bottled july 2009 . no sign of abv on label though this site proclaims 8.7 . pours into my duvel glass a thick , moderately opaque black . when held to light the exact replica of plum color is revealed . the head is foamy , off white , and leaves some thick lacing behind . carbonation bubbles are clearly seen rising to the top despite the dark color . the carbonation bubles that make it to the top form an intricate ring of bubbles that feed the head and keep it frothy atop the beer ( thanks to the duvel glass as well ) . very nice appearance to this one . smell is very clovy which is the main scent , with some dark fruits ( plum ) . as it oxidizes the fruit and sweet malt scents come out a bit more . the smell is decent , slightly different from and not as complex as the other quads i 've had . flavor is bursting with fruity sweetness . slightly bitter finish . i 'm not that huge of a fan of the semi-cloying sweetness mixed with the bitterness . this sort-of reminds me of koeningshoven . the alcohol content is less than a koeningshoven but is just as prevalent , as it mixes with the bitterness and sweetness with some burn . i would have liked it to hide a little bit more . but the exiting depth of plum flavor and nice complimentary malts excuse a bit of the alcohol and sweetness problems this one has . the mouthfeel is right on , i love the carbonation level , it works well to cut through some of the sweetness . i would have to dock the drinkability down a bit because the alcohol is n't too well hidden , a 22 oz is good , but a 12 would have been primo . overall a good entry for the quad field , impressive considering this brew is american .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70	poured a dark golden with a minimal top . it smelled of mango and other fruits . went down smooth with no after taste . not bad , but could include a few more hops to round out the beer . i would recommend even without . it was very good between 45 and 55 degrees .

0.60 0.80 0.40 0.70 0.70	750ml to tulip . sampled in march 2011 . $ 8.50 for the bottle . a : large three finger foamy head , medium dark brown in color and long lasting . the color of the body is black with amber brown hints along the edges when backlit . otherwise completely opaque . fair lacing . besides the black color , this beer looks pretty good . s : roasted ( if not lightly burnt ) grain , cocoa powder and a nuttiness reminiscent of walnut oil . grassy hop aroma . t : the aromas listed above make their way to the palate , as well as a pleasant fruit character and a dry , almost tannic woodiness ( although i 've never heard anyone say there is wood treatment involved ) . m : medium to light body with below average carbonation . an improved mouthfeel would help elevate the flavors . d : among the better stillwater offerings i 've had to date but have yet to be blown away . i 'm just not digging the novelty of the black saison . the color of a beer alone does n't make it taste outstanding .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	2010 on-tap at the goat . appearance- black ? deep reddish/brown . a nice inch of thick head , caps nicely on tap . not much lacing . smell- bourbon . vanilla , cherry and raisins . a little booze . nice . taste- raisin for sure . too much of it in fact . bourbon is a little too mellow for me . some coffee-ish roast . dry . seems to lack a little depth . i want there to be a flavor behind the flavor . mouth- thin ? how ? it looked so nice . but it was n't . drink- easy as it goes . i feel like other beers have passed this one by . it 's a little thin , it lacks depth , and too much raisin for my taste . it 's a good beer , but it could have been a great beer .

1.00 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	opaque black with a standar tan stout head and moderate lacing . coffee and cocoa . maybe a wee bit of espresso . not as aggressive as a ris . i think i smell toasted marshmallow . smooth roasty coffee and some strong chocolate notes.finishes out a bit bitter but has a sweet malty backbone throughout . the mouth feel is amazing on this beer . so creamy and smooth a nice not to thick residual sweetness on the palette and finish clean and dry . only some very sought prickly carbonation on the front end . might be a tad filling as this seems to have a lot of lactose . but otherwise very drinkable . awesome brew from bells , what more would you expect . i just bottled a milk stout that i think will taste very close to this but less abv and probably more carbonation .

0.80 0.90 0.90 0.60 0.50	ah , twelve hops of christmas . perhaps the most overhyped beer of the series , and certainly the one i was most looking forward to for the last several releases . this beer turned out to be a bit of an enigma for me . at first everything seemed appropriate and extremely delicious , though over time i grew increasingly less fond of it . had on tap at the brewpub . served in a 'pear tulip ' ( i think that 's what the bartender called it ) due to the high abv . i could have sworn she told me the beer was 9.8 % abv but whatever . i also disagree with the style listing , much more of a sweet dipa to me ( like the ones some people argue ought to be barley wines ) . the malting is what makes this different i guess , and strong ale is all encompassing so i digress ... a - enigma # 1 . the bar was dimly lit when we arrived so at first i was blown away by the appearance of the beer . a dark cloudy copper color with a tall head - frothy , dense , and sticky as hell . a nice syrupy lace was being left behind in splotchy rings . lots of visible carbonation . i wanted to give this really high marks here , and at first i felt that the beer achieved a pseudo-winter warmer type of coloring , which would be suitible given the name/release of the beer . however , the more i looked into my glass , the more i felt that the cloudy copper/brown greenish/orange color was unappealing . i still enjoyed the appearance enough to give it a 4 though . s - best part of the beer . i could smell roots of columbus ipa in there , minus the pine notes . lots of citrus and tropical fruit , and some muddled earthiness underneath . the beer definitely smelled bitter , like a double ipa , but also sweet and with some biting alcohol notes piercing through the hops . i wanted to give a 5 , but things started the get a little messy as the beer warmed . caramel malt intermingles with some other malt that was indistinguishable , yet heavy - weighing down the lighter , airy fruit esters . t - enigma # 2 . my first impression was that this was a solidly outstanding double ipa . slightly sweet with just enough bitterness to make you pucker and keep my wife at bay from drinking this all herself . grapefruit and mango dominate the hop bill . the alcohol is apparent and prickles the front of the tongue and warms deep into the belly . but as the beer warms it morphs into something slightly sinister . the malts are all over the place ... messy , and suddenly it dawns on me - batch 10,000 ! the horror ! not quite as off-putting as the bells amalgamtion from hell , but certainly reminiscent to say the least ... my final decision was that this beer tasted like the bastard child of batch 10,000 , columbus ipa , and bells oracle . sweet , fruity , hoppy and bitter , with a sweet but strong alcohol bite and a messy malt profile that is all over the radar . m - well carbed , almost too much , but i enjoyed it . strong alcohol , sticky and sweet . full bodied , almost chewy for such a hoppy , highly carbonated beer . d - would i drink this again ? yes . would i rather have other incarnations of the hop odyssey ? hell yes . and at $ 29 a growler this felt way overpriced . i was content with my glass priced at $ 6.75 .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	served at just above fridge temperature in a tulip glass , poured from a gray swing-top ceramic bottle . a - clean , clear honey golden color . creamy , pillowy light tan head with fantastic retention and lacing . s - very prominent yeasty , honey-meade nose . light fleshed , over-ripe fruit notes . t - reminds me a bit of stoudt 's honey mai bock off the bat . sweet , honey roundness up front and in the middle . very bittersweet hoppiness in the finish that gives this beer a slightly drying character without any cloying . alcohol is almost non-existant in the mouth . m - super smooth , round and slick . only lightly effervescent , making the mouthfeel of this beer fantastic . i could n't picture the mouthfeel of this beer being any better . d - this one is `` perilously drinkable '' ( to quote michael jackson 's tasting notes which my friend and i reviewed *after* doing this rating ) . the amazing mouthfeel coupled with the well developed and super tasty character of this beer make it an easy drinker .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	what a total transformation ( see my review from a couple days ago below ) . this time the beer was my first of the day & i had not yet had dinner . the aroma is considerably dried out compared to my first go at this beer . this plays up the earthy , spicy phenolic aromas , but all of the components i first noticed are still there ( even the orange zest note , still plays a noticeable role ) . this includes the sweet malt aromatics , but they now play a background role that you have to dig for . the flavor is also quite dry compared to my first experience with this beer . it still has a medium heft to it , but without the omnipresent sweetness it is much more subdued . this is a really interesting experience , i would almost say that these were two completely different brews ; this just goes to show the drastic change ones palate can undergo over short periods of time . the light sweetness that i now experience really drives the spice character to new levels . all the spice components are here , they are just a bit more pronounced ( except for the citrus notes , which i find are usually amplified by sweetness ) ; the beer has a much more present pepper note as well as a sharply herbal & ginger character . the finish is noticeably phenolic , though not too the point of off-plastic notes , instead it just adds some cutting sharpness to the flavor profile . the more noticeable phenolics make me think of an earthy , green , coriander flavor that i did not get last time . the dry malt notes of toasted grain , and biscuit-like flavors is also a bit more present . i could still wish that this finished a bit drier ( my preference is usually for a bone dry saison ) , but i feel this is well within the well-made-commercial level . the thing that this really brings home ( something that i already knew , but had n't experienced so drastically in the recent past ) , was how much ones palate can change in a short period of time .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	12 oz brown bottle with a bottled on date . a- semi-sticky white lace with a hazed dusty golden hue . s- pumpkin rind , spices and a mild malt sweetness in the nose . t- big fruity ale flavors , abundant of spices and a layer of fermented pumpkin . malt sweetness holds its own with a balanced spice character . finishes earthy . m- exceptionally smooth with a medium body . d- true to new england , one of the few pumpkin ales i could drink all night long .

0.40 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60	coopers best extra stout 's beige , almost brown head quickly pulled a disappearing act and i was soon left with a beverage resembling soy sauce . i ca n't comment on the lace because none adhered to my glass . i was more than a little concerned to find a lot of sediment . i am not particularly adverse to things floating in my beer if they are meant to be there . what did i observe ? well , the particles looked like seeds or tiny wood chips . i allowed them to settle in the bottom of the glass ( a process that took approximately fifteen minutes ) and after finishing the stout i decided to be a man and try them out for taste . surprisingly , the sediment was n't hard and i did n't feel a corporeal presence in my mouth . i did , however , notice that they were as bitter as all hell . did some hops remain undissolved in my bottle ? points off , not for the sediment , but for the lack of head and lace . the aroma was unexpectedly light and i could detect roasted coffee and alcohol . the taste started out lightly sweet and had a slight hops and alcoholic aftertaste . not too bad . coopers best extra stout was nice on the palate ; softly carbonated and creamy . to tell you the truth , i was a bit disappointed . i think i would like to try this beer again , however , not from the same selection that was on sale in my local supermarket . it is possible that i came across a bad batch .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	soft foamy head of about one finger , mix of all bubble sizes , close to bone white , very credible lacing . bronze orange to a light brown in color , distorts light easily . sweetly florid nose with a whole bunch of orange , lemon juice in addition to roasted nuttiness , corn , honeyed bread , sweetened cereal , crunchy apple , pear and peach scents , while thick overall does achieve a little lift . full-bodied , creamy in feel with not a rough patch in sight , rubs gently into the palate . lemon , orange and grapefruit citrus dominant here too , juicy and friendly with minimal bite . malt , corn , granola , cinnamon , dehydrated apple and pear fruit starting to concentrate , some banana . hint of caramel , toffee . hard to pick out any keenly edged hoppy components . stays fluffy and carbonated through the finish , no alcoholic heat but `` heady '' in a boozy way . very affable , the john candy of beers .

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.90	this pours from 1 pint can a dull , slightly hazy gold with a solid 2 finger head of foam with lots of lacing . it *is* a nitro can after all . ; ^ ) the smell has a nose of bitter hops and a touch of honey sweetness . the taste matches the smell ... good hop bitterness ( no citrus really , just bitter ) with some honey sweetness and some metallic taste . silky smooth mouthfeel here and it finishes slightly bitter ; the finish is actually the only part that i do n't fancy too much but over all , this is a pretty good taster and so darn easy to drink . i do n't know why i like boddingtons , i just do and i buy it every so often .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	opened bottle , poured into snifter . formed head of 2 '' , that dies down to layer of bubbly lace across top of slightly hazy golden colored brew . smells a tad bit spicy , some malt aromas also on nose . taste is much better than smell with slight tropical fruit hints - that banana taste that comes from belgian yeast . nice bubbles and good finish make for a pleasant mouth feel . easily drinkable ... but there is something missing - ca n't quite place it .

0.90 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	pours a nice deep rich darker orange color , lightly hazy . big thick creamy beige colored head falls slow and laces well , very nice looking brew . aroma is nice lots of sweet caramel malts nice citrus fruits orange , mango more sweet then bitter smelling . taste is more harsh then the aroma bitting carbonation is masking the rich chewy caramel some what . hops show up and finish lingering bitterness pine , grapefruit notes . little disappointed in how this one is going down after smelling so sweet . mouthfeel is medium with too much carbonation for my tastes . drinkability is eh , its not undrinkable but with so many i2pa 's being wonderful see no reason to be drinking this one .

0.60 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.60	i had this on draught at stone 's 7th anniversary party . appearance : this pours yellow/gold with a diminishing white head . aroma : this started out with a huge , beautiful hoppy , floral , citrusy nose . flavor : then , i drank some & everything went downhill . it was watery & disappointing . oh well ,

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.80 1.00	i 'm giving this a high drinkability score because it 's been an available standby for years . i 've never had a skunky bottle ( yet ) , but have had a couple of regrettable pints on tap . this ale would have gotten a much higher score if not for the experience of sampling many of the favorites on the ba site . this particular bottle pours a beautiful clear , brown amber with an ample off-white head . nose is subdued , hints of sweet caramel and remote apples . in the mouth , it 's rather average , with light carbonation . hazelnut and walnut ride on a nice balance of mild hops and sweet malt . not a strong ale , and finishes nicely crisp . to me , it seems a little watered down after what i 've been having recently , but i still consider newcastle brown a relaible old companion .

0.80 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.80	poured from a can into a pint . pours light straw with bubbly effervescent head that disappears immediately . aroma is light corn and maybe hops ... not sure . bitter aroma has to be hops . flavor is thin and watery ... corny flavors with dms and wet cardboard smells . not even a good macro lager as defined by the style guide , bad . water is the mouthfeel ... .water , with some bubbles .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 1.00	when the bottle is fresh , ( or on tap ) this is a stellar hefe . it seems like even after 6-8 months , there 's a drop-off in the smell and taste , which mutes it 's formerly big flavors . pours a deep , tawny orange , with a ton of foam . as it settles , the sediment is poured in , darkening the body a bit with cloudy tendrils of yeast . smells like clove and dry wheat husks . on tap it smells alot better , i 'll have to add a tap review later . taste is straightforward , more of a dominant clove spice over the round wheat backbone . maybe a slight citrus shows up in the spicing toward the finish . easy to drink due to it 's creamy mouthfeel and pleasant flavor . recommended !

0.30 0.40 0.40 0.50 1.00	on tap at the southampton publick house s - mildly floral a - almost clear t - seltzer , hits of water cracker , touch of hops , watery finish . m - fizz of carbonation up front . super light body . d - excellent drinkability , but in a potable water kind of way . o - way to light . not much flavor to speak of .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.60	on-tap into a pint glass ... this was suppose to be the best beer they had , probably was but still not saying a whole lot ... pours a totally clear dark orange with notes of copper , looks good . the head is a nice off white , good retention and lace ... the aroma is also pretty good , mostly grassy on the front with a hint of caramel , pine hop finish ... the taste is decent at first , light toffee and grass . the finish becomes way too bitter , hops are off , reminds me more of an ipa . not terrible but i would n't have this again unless my prison was harrison 's and i was sentenced to life without parole .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	i was very pleased having tried this on a bit of a whim . another find at frugal macdougal 's . picked up the nicely designed bottle and poured a ( much lighter than expected ) hazy goldenrod . smell is like the highlands ... floral , crisp , herbal . some sweetness , very pungent . taste is good , though the heather did n't flex its muscles quite as i expected . strongest aspect is the mouthfeel/finish , imo which acts like a white wine , floral and crisp , dry dry dry to the end . not really sure what to give on drinkability . i 'd have another , but after that the uniqueness suggests trying something else . maybe the kelpie offering by the same label ? intriguing ...

0.60 0.50 0.30 0.70 0.40	pours golden to amber in color . basic bitter citrus hop aroma . same for the taste , quite hoppy , in a citrus , almost funky over-ripe sort of way . the moutfeel is kind of heavy and sticky , a bit too much so for the style of brew . not a bad beer , but i wouldnt pick it out of a crowd .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	a - dark golden orange hue to the body with an off-white frothy head standing about an inch and a half tall . moderate carbonation and nice lacing make for an appealing look . s - soap , grain , malt and subtle hops . t - malty start moving to a smooth hopped middle . the finish offers a relaxing malt . m - the feel is smooth and light . perhaps a bit of subtle coarseness could bring out a bit more of the grainy flavor . ~ overall i think this is a quality brew . my lovely wife was kind enough to bring this back to me during one of her recent trips down to the chicago area . i 'm always open to gifts i can drink . i suggest this beer be on your hit list .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.50 0.70	bottle received in the `` good things come in 3 's '' bif appearance : golden corners wrapped around a slightly copper body with a huge 3+ finger foam head . loads of retention and lacing everywhere . smell : its got a bit of belgian style yeast in the nose coupled with wheat , fresh cut grass , and a touch of hay . taste : muddled and uninspired mouthfeel : absolutely thin and lacking in every way imaginable . one of the worst mouthfeels i 've come across . drinkability : low abv , thin , but terrible tasting so why bother . i 'm really happy i enjoyed flossmoors ploughman brown first , otherwise i probably would n't give them a second chance if this pale wheat ale had been my first experience .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.90	appearance : pours ( into a snifter ) a dark , rapidly moving chocolate brown with two fingers of head . carbonation appears to be tiny and voluminous at once ; tiny bubbles move in a wave to the top of the glass creating a head that almost appears to be on nitro-tap . the head itself is fluffy and a color slightly darker than a mocha-latte -- a touch of caramel added in . drank this one on a particularly hot day ( who says it 's the end of summer ? ) so the glass quickly has a large amount of condensation on the outside , creating a somewhat glittering effect/illusion . the head glistens like soap bubbles on its own . an extremely consistent and good looking beer with a lot of movement . very nice ( and fairly long-lasting ) lacing as well . smell : very earthy , with berry , dark fruit , and a slight hint of chocolate . some vanilla notes as well , blending with the slightest hint of bourbon notes , though both of these are an undercurrent to the bright berry notes . very well-balanced . taste : more dark fruits than in the nose , with a nice caramel twist added in . slightly milky as well , and very smooth . slightly tangy , with a bit of charcoal bitterness thrown in as well which carries through into the aftertaste . the bitterness provides an interesting element to the taste -- when you first take a drink , ( or at least when i do ) you notice first the sour cherry notes , but almost instantly are hit by a blast of syrupy -- something -- which comes across at times also as cherry cough syrup , though if it were exactly that i would n't be drinking it . then , shortly thereafter , the bitterness hits . it 's probably better than i 'm making it sound ... but it 's definitely strange . mouthfeel is sub-par for what otherwise is an excellent beer . very little heat , but the carbonation does n't hold up the way i would have hoped ( or expected from the appearance ) . there is very little carbonation , in fact , the beer seems rather flat save for an unpleasant foaminess at the end of the sip indicating , as the appearance did , that indeed there was once carbonation somehow present in this beer . looking back a few minutes later , the carbonation is in fact there but sort of just _sits_ on your tongue . drinkability : very smooth and low heat -- would n't expect it to be this good at this abv -- though at the same time it is also very obvious that it is a 10 % . the fact that i can drink this on such an oppressively hot day speaks volumes .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.80 1.00	pours hazy translucent yellow . generous head , huge bubbles , very effervescent . smells of yeast and a hint of citrus . nothing bad in the smell at all . taste is extremely smooth , again yeast and a very subtle hint of citrus . i would like a little more citrus , actually . the word to define this beer is smooth . no overpowering tastes , just straight beer .

0.70 0.30 0.60 0.30 0.30	appearance - body is a dark , fairly clear amber with ruby highlights . head is a large , light tan affair that settles slowly and leaves some lacing . smell - very medicinal in aroma . some maltiness . lots of esters . some spies like cinnamon and clove . not looking forward to this . taste - strong medicinal taste/ bleh . barely tastes like beer . taste like cooking sherry . i 'm dumping it . mouthfeel - light to medium body . good level of carbonation . no objections here . d - ughghgh . unless you are gluten intolerant , i do not recommend trying this beer .

0.90 0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90	i had this beer out of the bottle frosted in my favorite mug . it had a golden brown color , with a nice two finger head on it . it had a fruity smell to it , as well as a hint of fruit to the taste . the mouthfeel was light but a bit chewy . overall this was an excellent beer , i enjoyed every sip ! i 'll continue to look for this beer on tap wherever i 'm at

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40	ok so this was my first ipa , maybe i had a bad bottle ... not sure , so take this review with a grain of salt ... a- looks good , nice golden color , lots of foam- dissolves average with some really nice webbing s- smells good as well- bitter citrus , no real hop smell at all- ( kinda surprised t- no i would not recommend the taste- very bitter- not crisp , but not skunk either- just not my favorite combo of flavors m- pretty dry to the tongue d- could n't finish my beer because the taste repelled me

1.00 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.40	thanks to drez77 for the extra . 16oz can to oversized wine glass . clever name , fun label . a : pours with an ivory white head , 2 fingers high . the head starts out fizzy and foamy and looks like it will disappear quickly , but multiple streamers keep it around for quite some time , eventually transforming the head into a dense , compact foamy cap . the body is hazy , but clear enough too see an endless amount of bubbles rushing by in a somewhat roundabout way . the color is between gold and goldenrod and has medium saturation . the entire glass is left coated with one continuous sheet of lace . s : toasted pilsner malts mixed in with a light grain and straw component . heavily yeasty . big hop concentration , starting out with big pine notes plus the peel of lemon and orange but , at warmer temperatures , becoming cleaner-like . scorching alcohol on the nose . t & m : aromas come through to the palate with some additional flavors of banana and pear and sweet candied sugar flavors . thankfully , the alcohol is easier on the palate than it was on the nose . full body with a creamy texture and a surprisingly passive , low level of effervescence . soft and semi prickly but needs to be much livelier . below average flavor duration . d : hot , kind of messy and not very easy to drink . note : this beer may not have traveled well since , even though it was safely packaged , it arrived with a huge bulge on the top of the can . also , my experience was nothing like what i 've read from other reviewers .

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.70	i always look forward like most do the annual stone anniversary brews.poured a rich deep amber with a tight and sticky one finger off white head , big hops in the nose with a mix pine and herbal/leaf , there is a gummy , fruity-like sweet note as well.the mouthfeel is a bit sharp i will say it crashes down the gullett at first , it does begin to smooth out after a few sips but still seems a bit harsh.no holds barred hops hit the palate up front with big pine and big herbalness , a healthy does of sweeter alcohol gives a slight burn along with a bit of dark fruit.very good but seems like it something that should sit for awhile , still another fine one from stone .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	visual : pours haze gold color . no head , no lacing . aroma : wheat , and light fruit taste : big toasted wheat taste rounded with a distinct hop bitterness . also has a slight sweet apple taste with a bit of spice . finishes pretty dry . mouth : medium-light , rather smooth , somewhat creamy , noticable carbonation . drunkability : i would say this beer is fairly average . however , i like this beer over other more pungent wheat ales because it lacks that heavy coriander flavor . could drink a few of these but defintely isnt one to be sought out .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80	a- a hazy orange liquid with a bit of a gray aspect . the white head is quick to rise and fall leaving a small ring and a small splotch . s- lemon , farm blanket , and some light fruit . definitely not the most outstanding take on the style , but it is enjoyable . t- bready with some lemon zest , fruit , and a touch of horse blanket . simple . effective . m- creamy smooth with just the right amount of carbonation and a nice , dry finish . d- a very enjoyable beer that i would love to see widely distributed in cans- especially in the summer months .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	i remember tasting this when i was about 19 and finding it absolutely awful . something inside of me knew i was missing out but i really could n't stand to take another sip . i now love the style and am eager to taste and review it . one sip with this new palate of mine , and just what i thought : a whole new beer to me . a- kind of a rosy light gold . almost clear . moderate amount of bubbles rising . very nice looking white head looks chewy . lacing looking right . s- surprisingly strong pear smell . apple sauce and apple pie filling . yeast . reminds me a bit of a nectar cola . a little bit of clove . when warm i get red licorice . a little sickly sweet but not unbearable . smells like a mix of the usual belgian blond , a hefweizen and when the head is still thick and fresh , a pilsen . t- similar to smell but easier on the pear . clove is still here . alcohol taste is strong . a bit of an off , wet carboard background/after-taste that kind of ruins it . tastes really artificial or processed . m- full and viscous . lots of carbonation that feels pretty much perfect . pretty dry considering the viscosity and sweetness . d- refreshing , not that much to offend . six-pack session is a maybe if you 're really thirsty . what makes me uncertain is how damn sweet it is . something about this beer feels pretty different from any beer i 've ever had . i 've had sweet done better . happy i tried it again ( as if i was n't going to ) will buy it again . ca n't wait to try the brune .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60	murky deep brown with shards of garnet . foamy tan head on top that is dissipating quickly . smell is strong ale . not as hop heavy as you might expect . somewhat smoother than original bastard . good malt in the nose . alcohol noticeable as well . this has a bite to it in the taste . good malt , definitely subdued hop presence , but the alphas are all there . not much aroma hops . toasted , burnt , biscuity malts falling all over the place . there is an astrigent/medicinal effect also that i find a lot in oak-aged beers . mouthfeel is nice . good carbonation , not too fizzy . easier to drink probably than it 's brother . a nice brew , but i 'll take the original bastard over the oaked .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	until this past weekend i never had any of the different poor richard 's offerings.poured a tawny brown with a thinner white head that was gone quickly.big molasses sweetness in the nose , along with some dark fruit tones , no real hop presence to be found.cloying on the palate , the molasses dominates everything in my mind , mild roast shows through just not enough of a drying effect here to take away the sweetness.not a big fan of this offering .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.80	bottle poured into a tulip a : pours a very dark black , opaque and very thick . its spongy , dark tan head has tight bubbles . s : smells sweet with chocolate as well as a slight alcohol twinge and a hint of hoppy bitterness . a dark fruit , fig aroma exposes itself at the end . t/m : taste is very thick , syrupy and extremely smooth . cocoa is apparent right away with some other type of sweetness , likely from the malts or malt extract , which also lends credence to a dark , roasted quality and finishes with a tiny hop bite . it has a medium amount of carbonation , which is surprisingly higher than it looks , and a bit of alcohol lingers throughout . the texture is incredible and the flavor is very good as well , but not as good as the mouthfeel . very good all around and i look forward to trying/making more .

0.70 0.50 0.90 0.60 0.90	the grill is seeing continuous action these days , almost always with a lager in hand . not that it did n't during the summer . it 's just that everyone has gone inside & left all the beer out here with me . : d a couple inches of eggshell suds tops off a slightly blushed , though still vibrant copper brew . it quickly settles & dissipates , but continues to pump out the co2 . smell is faintly metallic , a little husky , ticklish hops , with a bit of toffee & a cheap euro lager familiarity . tastes of toasted plain bread crumbs , mineral water , dry leaves , margarine , & alcohol . body is constantly active , suds filling in every crevice of your mouth ; pop rocks potential . initially juicy , even subconsciously creamy , but with a slightly dry finish . cheaper then bud & so very tolerable .

0.80 1.00 0.40 0.60 0.60	thanks to timmcd64 who included this as an extra in an awesome trade . pours an elegant black with a modest tan head . the smell is outstanding - i was salivating from the roasty nutty goodness . the taste did n't do so much for me though . there 's some chocolate and roastiness , but more modest than expected . there 's a metallic lacticity , which i guess is the `` milk '' bit . i know they were n't intending a sweet beer , but i think this still could stand to be a bit sweeter . also , make sure you drink this one warm . i had to let it warm up more than most beers to get the real flavor profile . the beer seems thin and watery to me , yet still slick . and too carbonated for these kinds of flavors . i did n't quite manage to finish the bomber -- i just was n't that into this beer . but it 's such an odd mixture . and it makes my stomach feel fairly full for something of fairly low gravity . i give midnight sun credit for trying things out here . i like how they push the envelope . this beer is interesting , but in my opinion not up to many of their other outstanding offerings . if offered the opportunity , i would say you try it . it 's commendably interesting and unique , but it just did n't really impress me .

0.90 0.70 0.80 0.40 0.60	shared this 22 oz bomber during a small cabin getaway earlier last week . here 's my take - a : the beer has a nice rufous hue ( reddish-brown/oxidized iron ) . nice beige head that remains for almost the entirety of the beer , good cascading lacing . beautiful looking beer . s : after reading the description of this beers build the amarillo hops become even more evident , another hop forward beer from the 3f boys , especially considering the style . the nose is tropical hops , caramel toffee , and brown-sugared honey . t : there is a striking similarity to 3f alpha klaus ' hop profile , which is n't to my liking . hopheads unite ! sure ? perhaps it 's the amarillo hops and combination of honey that sets me off , gives it a sweetness entirely disagreeable to my palate . i am fond of dreadnaught , but the hops used in combination with the particular malt yield difference results apparently . i could taste underneath the unpleasant sweetness toffee and caramel . m : the mouthfeel can not suffer just from the taste ... medium bodied beer , above average carbonation , but at times a bit thin . d : great looking brew with a nose that i find likable , just when it hits the tongue it 's a different story . i 'll be weary of the amarillo/honey forward beers from 3f from now on .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.80 0.70	big thanks to my buddy dan for sharing this one ! marked as bottle # 21 a- poured from the bottle with a thin tan head , which quickly evaporated to reveal a completely opaque still black body . s- smells of roasted and stewed malts up combined with impressions of dried licorice and dark fruit , and just a whiff of smoke and sawdust . a moderately rich nose overall . t- rich roasted and stewed malts up-front are met with a touch of smoke in the middle , turning to a tannic , slightly bitter finish , which lingers tremendously on the tongue . there 's an oaky and briny retronasal effect here as well . incredibly dry and dynamic , but the flavors are a bit muddled- the only thing keeping this from being a 4.5 in the flavor department . m- medium-plus body with a tremendously pervasive soft and creamy carbonation . moderately high astringency and a soft etoh heat . a fantasticly crafted mouthfeel . d- this is definitely a sipper- and a nice treat to split amongst friends .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	pours almost black with a small dark caramel colored head , good retention . very pretty beer . smell is chocolate and coffee , and a few other lovely flavors i ca n't quite place . yummy ! the chocolate tastes very high quality ; rich and full . the coffee flavors are n't as pronounced as in the smell , which i like . the flavors resulting from the barrel conditioning are very subtle to me , but work very well to offset the sumptuous chocolate . tastes slightly complex as i try to pick out the flavors . well balanced and refined . mouthfeel is incredible , one of the smoothest beers i 've had . a strong and dense texture which works exceptionally for this beer . this is a good sipping beer . the 13 % surprised me .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	celebrator is definitely a great beer . it is a very dark , almost black color . it provides a good head and the smell of this beer is really something special . the aroma of chocolate is detectable as well as a very malty smell . this is a thick beer but not overpowering . it is not highly carbonated and goes down smooth . the flavors of chocolate and coffee are evident . despite its thick body , it goes down smooth . i had a few of these during christmas dinner and afterward . a few people have said it has gone well with meats but i would also suggest it with goose which is what i had for christmas this year . it turned out to be a good combination .

0.70 0.40 0.20 0.30 0.40	brown/amber thing beige head . smells of medicinal phenols , toasted bread , a weird citrusy presence . i think i even get some light lactic/sour notes ( possible infection ? ) . tastes roasty , there are hints of caramel , toasted bread , some citrusy notes , and some harsh metallic flavors too . mouthfeel is thin/watery and unpleasant . bad beer . waste of the glass bomber it came in .

0.80 0.30 0.70 0.40 0.20	thanks to bosse for giving this to me last time i was in stockholm . served in a taster pint glass . bottled 3/8/2007 , best before 1/1/2012 . a - pours with a voluminous tan foam that settles to a thick cap , leaving behind spotty lace . transparent medium brown body . this is one dark `` saison '' . s - anise , tart apple skins , medicinal spruce and juniper , and a faint note of inner tubes . the malt character is largely obscured by the adjuncts . t - extreme anise bitterness , mixed with some char and dark chocolate bitterness . a bit of sugary malt emerges when it warms , but it does n't come close to saving this beer . m - medium carbonation , medium body , and a sticky tooth-coating finish . alcohol is well-hidden . d - yikes . i could n't get this one out of my glass fast enough .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	poured from a 207ml . bottle . appearance : pours thick and brown with 2 fingers of head . not bad . smell : classic molasses aroma with the sweetness a bit too strong . taste : some caramel and molasses but thankfully not too sweet . flavor is strong then literally disappears . weird . mouthfeel : not much carbonation and the body is kind of watery . drinkability : average at best . best thing about it is the small size . overall : i 've had better malt beverages . do n't bother with it .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	poured from a 500 ml bottle into a snifter . a : black , with a light head that sticks around and leaves some thick splotches of lacing . s : oak , vanilla , plenty of bourbon notes and some dark cherry/fruit notes . the alcohol is well masked , but it 's there . m : the carbonation on this one is perfect . it attacks the tongue and disappears quickly . creamy and rich , but it actually finishes pretty clean . perfect mouthfeel . t : vanilla notes dominate , followed by some slight roasted malt . some dark fruit , but not all that noticeable . some hints of dark chocolate but it is again masked by the vanilla . o : very well done . this is what i want in an ris . creamy and full bodied . a fine offering , and i do n't think it even needs cellaring . this tastes like one that i 've had around for a while . very little improvement necessary .

0.50 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.60	another stout today , so awesome ! pours inky dark black , a small finger of dark tan head dissipates into a tiny rim of foam , not much lacing . aromas are alternately sweet , then dry . lots of dark chocolate notes as would be expected . some hints of spiciness is in there , too . maybe clove and licorice . not super exciting so far , but good . flavor is very unique . super robust , very tangy right upfront . lots of sweet chocolate malt , roasty roast-o goodness provides a sharp tang . this melds into a middle that strikes me as sweet , but only for an instant . this rides a nice long wave into what appears to be hershey 's hot cocoa mix . mouth is wonderfully creamy and velvety . finish is also super long and breaks into some hoppy hop bitterness and some of the cocoa notes . great , complex and unique flavors roll around in this and the 10 % abv is wonderfully masked . probably expensive , but this was a trade so i have no idea . i 'll assume middle range price . not sure you could sit through more than two of these as it is such a rich brew , but i would try on turkey day while watching football . i 'll bet this tastes awesome with pecan pie , or even pumpkin pie/cheescake . what i like most : the beautiful , unique and complex flavor profile . what i like least : the average pour and appearance . verdict : awesome , robust unique ale . must find if you can .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	poured from a 12 oz bottle into a westmalle chalice . appearance : pours a dark yellow/orange color . very little head which separates into a few clumps of dense bubbles . very clean , no sediment , fairly cloudy , does n't let a lot of light through . looks like this one will have plenty of carbonation . smell : i can definitely smell the wheat in this beer . plenty of citrus , orange , raspberry , and blackberry . not a ton there , but that 's okay . as it warms up there is a little black pepper that comes through . taste : mainly blackberry flavor . a little bit of citrus with some orange and lemon , just as an afterthought though . a slight bitterness at the end . a touch of alcohol . the orange comes through more as the drink warms , as does some spices . mouthfeel : light body , medium carbonation , but the bubbles do n't really `` prickle '' the tongue like i thought it would . a very nice and smooth carbonation . overall : this beer has a crisp , light flavor , which is appropriate for the style .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	pours very dark for a bock , opaque auburn with a large beige head . smells like sugar and wood . chocolate , big bock malt . smooth and strong , really everything you can reasonably hope for . tastes solid , just like it smells . crisp bockmalt , big chocolate nodes , dry hops at the end and a slight burn .

0.90 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.50	poured into a mj tasting glass . pours a deep black with ruby highlights around the edge of the glass , with a creamy , light mocha head . the head slowly drops , leaving tons of lacing . aromas of chocolate , coffee , roasted grains , and alcohol . first sip is of mainly roasted grains , light hints of cocoa . not the big flavor burst i was expecting . mouthfeel is thin for a ris , almost watery . light creaminess . fairly decent drinkable beer . but nothing too exciting about it . not a big flavorful brew .

0.70 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.30	i had this once in bottles and figured it might have just been an out of date bottle . i decided to give it a go on tap at a respectable beer bar . i ordered it and it poured a very clear light yellow ( reminded me a bid of budweiser in color/clarity ) with a fluffy white head . the smell was like peach boone 's farm , only possibly slightly more acidic/tart on the nose . no beer smell whatsoever . taste : hits the tongue like a bulldozer with the biting tartness . the only noticable flavor is the overwhelming tart peachness . there 's no balance whatsoever . again this is like some more sour verson of a boone 's farm or something . there 's almost no wheat flavor or aroma here . the only thing that keeps this from getting a 1 is that i know it is supposed to taste this way in some madman at dfh 's mind . mouthfeel/drinkability : i almost drain poured this and ordered something else . it almost tasted like an infected saison or something . i choked it down , but this is going to keep me from being adventurous with dfh beers for at least 6 months . it hit the tongue , throat and stomach with all the finesse of a piano falling off the roof . while it did pass my gulp test for drinkability it was only because i was gulping it as fast as i could to finish it and move onto something better . side rant : if sam adams is going to catch hate for using extracts in their beer instead of real fruit , i have to heap some on dfh as well . a little bit of peach in a wheat beer could have been refreshing and enjoyable . instead this is a peach bomb that i ca n't believe made it out of the brewpub .

0.70 0.70 0.80 0.80 0.30	a - a nice strong hazy yellow with good head , lacing , and moderate retention . s - yeasty , coriander , anisey , citrusy . t - follows the nose almost precisely with some banana flavor that was n't initially detectable in the nose . perfectly carbonated and balanced . however , it 's pretty rich . m - pretty thin and definitely refreshing . i love the mouthfeel of this brew . d - this is this beer 's downfall to me . too rich ; it 's flavor is a killer on the tastebuds . on my first sip , i thought this beer was an a+ , but i 'm nearing my last now and it 's going considerably downhill . more suited to 12 oz bottles , but then again , who could drink a 6 of this ? but overall , a decent brew .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.20 0.20	appearance : a hazy , golden orange body with only the very barest hints of white head . it looks strikingly like a glass of warm ... well , it does n't look like the style standard . aroma : juicy citrus , something herbal ( almost medicinal ) , and a big alcohol component . there 's sweetness beneath it all , but it 's not well defined . as different as this is , it 's either going to be very good or very bad . flavor : unfortunately , it 's the latter . at first , it tasted like a barbeque sauce soda . lots of soggy , musty wood notes over a bizarre , beer-like base . there 's a hint of something citrusy up front , but the wood almost instantly overwhelms it . the aftertaste is smoky and woody , and after a few minutes , could almost be described as pleasant . mouthfeel : medium bodied and smooth with low carbonation . drinkability : i 'll be charitable and just say `` poor . '' the majority is destined for the drain . verdict : holy shit , this is bad . at first , i was tempted to blame everything on this being an old bottle , but the bottle claims it 's good for months to come . combine that with how odd the other brewdog `` ipa '' i 've tried was , and i have to conclude this is not a fluke . avoid like the plague , especially at the exorbitant price .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.60 0.60	16.9oz bottle a- poured into a snifter . pours a dark brown color with a light tan head . s- the aroma is pine and juniper berries . there is also an almost minty freshness to it . almost smells like a cleaning product , but not in a bad way . t- the taste like the aroma starts out with a nice spiciness that is complemented with juniper , pine , a touch of rye and an array of other spices . m- the mouthfeel is full bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation . very nice ! d- overall , this is an interesting brew because it is different but i do n't think it is outstanding enough to purchase again . worth a shot though .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	the one true guinness ! black as a black beer should be , a nice tight tan head which was very smooth . the head left a nice lacing . it smells of soil which is a good thing . i could really smells the hops and flowers . the malts are also very pronounced . the taste is smooth all round with a rich maltiness . i could get a little of a molasses taste with maybe a currant fruit . but then the hops blasts your pallete with a citrus zing to it . the hops gives it a very dry after taste which in turn makes me want to drink more . those clever bastards at guinness ! i could drink this one alone in my study or with friends and family or at ragin ' parties . i just hop they maybe someone will spring to get the only true stout . guinness .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	pours a cloudy orangish gold color with head that looks a lot like whipped cream . it actually has peaks . smells very estery , lots of banana , some yeast , a tiny bit citrusy . reminds me a lot of a hefeweizen . tastes very estery too , not surprisingly . also very sweet . with some banana . some bitterness on the back end , but not too much . mouthfeel is soft and a little heavy . not really creamy , but not harsh either . all in all , it 's a great beer , hoegaadren has yet to let me down .

0.40 0.60 0.90 0.90 0.80	pours a very clear goldenrod color that resembles a very watery american lager . the head is fluffy and white but disappears in a blink . smells a bit more german than it appears with a little pepper and grain . the taste is so much betters than the look and scent . if i saw this beer in a glass not knowing what it was i would pass it by buy the flavor is on point . i get grainy breaded malts , herbal hop notes and that peppery feel that is necessary for the style . carbonation is lower but very striking and the beer goes down easy buy it gets too sweet as it warms so it 's a gulper . overall a good representation but could be a little cheaper i 'm my opinion for what it is .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80	a : orange and cloudy . minor to moderate amount of white foamy head . small amounts of fine sediment . semi-opaque . s : belgian yeast , tart/funk , lots of floral scents . vaguely reminiscent of the old ladies ' section of the perfume counter at the mall . cleaning solvents meet flowers with a touch of honey . t : floral , clean bitterness , some moderate tartness , and nice sweet malts . the floral flavors and the bitterness may be intended to go together with the funkiness , but to my palate , it started to get too bitter and herbal over time . then as it warmed , it turned the corner and was the opposite - almost cloyingly floral and sweet . m : moderate density and viscosity . carbonation seems to match the body pretty well and also is appropriate for the style . o : very well balanced . nice and clean and refreshing while also offering good complexity . very odd , interesting and both impressive and disappointing all at the same time .

0.70 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	i got this beer in the beers of the world gift box for christmas . sorry for the redundancy with that sentence haha . it 's got a nice bronze color , and a one finger foam head . retention is nice as well . immediate taste is a lil sharp and bready with a hint of citrus in the smell . it was not an out of this world experience , but it is a very light and enjoyable beer for everyday or get togethers .

0.70 0.90 0.50 0.60 0.70	huge pillow of off-white head ( everything was liberally carbed that night ) . grainy , average amber color . dry basil , fruit pits , pepper , lemon & orange rind , big soapy lavender tone . flavorwise : mellow biscuit flavors that get totally overwhelmed by dryed thyme , hibiscus/other tea similarities , & heather . a little too much like potpourri . in combination with the alcohol , the expected bittergreen notes hit like a throat shot after taking a wrong turn into the perfume department at macy 's . i 'm not sure if the thin body helped or hindered either . due to time constraints , i did drink my serving ( 12oz ) without too much hesitation .

0.80 1.00 0.70 1.00 1.00	drank from a 1 pt . 6 fl . oz . bottle purchased at mall discount liquors , cambridge , ma poured a clear , dark , crimson-mahogany with a one-finger , light tan , bubbly head that faded to a thin film . lots of drippy lacing along the glass . the aroma was outstanding . sweet and super intense with robust malts , caramel , toffee and a rich , vanilla oakiness . later , some ripe fruits , raisins and a brandy-like quality became evident . the taste was as good ( if not better ) than the nose . rich , flavorful , smooth and incredibly well balanced . tons of sweet , caramel malts and spices up front with a pervasive oakiness . as the beer moved along the palate , the flavor profile changed considerably . hoppy ( citrusy , cascade hops ) and alcohol rich on the back end with a hoppy , dry , slightly bitter , grapefruit-like finish . moderate alcohol warming was noticeable in the nose and mouth on the exhale . as the beer warmed , the alcohol did become slightly more pronounced , taking on an almost vodka-like character . body was medium with a slick mouthfeel . drinkability of this beer was outstanding . with so many interesting flavors and complexities , the 10 % abv was only moderately noticeable . furthermore , this beer was so well balanced . this was truly a joy to drink and would pair perfectly with a plate of stone fruits , dessert cheeses and nuts . note : as for a comparison with the arrogant bastard ale , this offering is a whole different beast ( pardon the pun ) . the double bastard has a substantially more intense and complex flavor profile . also , unlike the arrogant bastard , this beer has balance .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	appearance - pours a very dark amber color with an inch thick , tan looking head . smell - very sweet , caramel , malty , and roasted nuts . taste - has a toasty flavor , toffee , caramel , and kind of bitter . mouthfeel - medium bodied with low carbonation . overall - it 's a good beer for what it is.. but i just do n't like amber ales in general .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	color is light golden yellow and is hazy . it has a white head that stuck around for most of the drink . aroma is light , but i got some citrus . flavor is mostly piney hops , and it 's the predominant flavor in the beer . i was surprised to see that it was rated at only 38 ibus . i expected it to be much higher . it has nice malts in the background . body is light and it 's very drinkable . pale 31 has a similar creamy mouth feel that i noticed in solace . i wonder if this is a result of fermenting in oak barrels ?

0.70 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40	i know i keep promising about the canquest ( tm ) , bottle be back to it soon , i swear ! from the bottle : `` a belgian-style pale ale crafted with a hint of wheat , orange peel , and hibiscus [ ! ] for a perfectly balanced hop taste and smooth finish . `` ; `` pale moon is our unique take on a pale ale . it 's crafted with a touch of wheat to offer an inviting hop taste with a smooth finish . pale moon is brewed with cascade hops , european malts , and a touch of orange peel and hibiscus - all perfectly balanced in this copper-colored ale . cheers ! '' from the style description , in lieu of direction on the bottle : `` they should be decanted properly , leaving the yeast in the bottle . '' i did not see much ( if any ) yeast in the bottle , but i bore it in mind as i poured . i am pretty sure that this was filtered , but i was careful all the same , which resulted in mere wisps for head . win some , lose some . color was a deep-amber with ne-quality clarity ( `` cu -colored ? who they tryin ' ta zoom ? ) . nose had a distinctive honey odor - could this be what the hibiscus was adding , if anything ? mouthfeel was actually pretty full , not outright creamy , but close . the taste was bland for all of the adjuncts that they mention . it was pale , all right , pale in flavor . i got a tea-like flavor in the mouth and whether it could be attributed to either the hibiscus or the hops , i do not know . finish was grassy , somewhat tea-like , but just not a lot happening . this was not bad , just boring .

0.40 0.30 0.80 0.20 0.40	a . slightly darker than yellow , but not much head or color . boring ... s. sweet , a slight malt hit and some belgium yeast . if i were to write a boring nothing belgium beer smell this would be it . it 's smells like exactlly what it is , but i refuse to score a beer a 1 on smell that is n't god awful ( smell and appearance are stupid ) t. belgium yeast ... that 's all i get . sure there is some yeast but give me a break . no hops no complexity . just awful belgium yeast . m/d it 's thin but it lacks anything really . you can drinking it the mouth feel has bubbles and what not . it seems like a drinker in mouth feel which fits the style enough , but it 's terrible . thus there is n't much if any drink ability .

0.70 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80	review from notes on 6/4/10 . poured dark brown , see through with burnt chestnut hues . a thin cream cap for a head , no lacing at all . looks rather sad for a stout but hopefully it can be improved ... robustness , coffee , chocolate , and roastiness is all there . not coming out after you , not trying to pull you into it , just there for you to inhale and wonder `` could there be more '' ? all in good balance , no doubt . but there 's nothing that wows me about it . a fairly thin mouthfeel akin to that of a 60 shilling scottish ale . it makes for a good drinker for sure . something i 'd drink after a morning of hard work .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.50	canned 3-22-10 . poured into sam adams perfect pint . a-pours a clear amber with a one finger head with moderate retention . left little lacing , but looks good . s-smells like someone created a hybrid pine/onion tree . part of it smells good , part of it smells bad , so i 'll call it a wash and give it a 3 . t-notes of citrus and pine are washed away in another oniony assault . this really is n't working . of course it does n't help that i hate onions . i keep picking up the onion flavor and its ruining it for me . m-on the light side of medium , but sticky and coating . the mouthfeel is the highlight of the beer for me . d-suffers from the acrid aftertaste and the oniony nose . glad i tried it , but i ca n't see drinking this one regularly . i 'd like to try it on tap just to see how it measures up to the can . so far i have loved everything i have tried from ob . but this one was a swing and a miss .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.80	thanks to mikesgrove for this one poured into my snifter produced a fingers worth of tan head that turns into a ring of lace around the glass .the body of this brew was dark brown in color aromas of roasted malts , some sweet toffee as well as coffee note filled my nose from the glass . the flavors of mimic the aromas but with a slight smoky bitter involved as well . i can see why the word peat was used before in a review the mouthfeel was medium to light i will agree it needs some more body to it this is a good brew and with a little tweaking it could become world class . i was very impressed , keep it up guys . thanks again mike for the opportunity

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.30 0.30	had this on tap at bodega . review from notes . geeze , this was an overpriced beer that purported to be something of significance . what a disappointment . deep cherrywood color with a small cap of white dander foam . left bits of webbed lace on the odd bodega 10oz tulip . smell was really lacking . mildly sweet . some vanilla and oak . a bit ho-hum to be honest . the flavor was sweet as hell . this beer would do well to continue aging on some fruit and brettonmyces or something . really young and brash imo . toasted coconut and very strong hazelnut . damn it , i hate hazelnut . ah , 't is true . i just ca n't get over the sweetness though , ugh , it 's really awful . there 's a mild amount of vanilla and a dry oaky finish . drinkability ? a rare/hard-to-find beer with high abv and super sweet aroma and flavor profiles makes for horribly poor drinkability in my book . i was sorely disappointed here , and i love most st offerings . i think i 'll pass on cuvee series four ...

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	12oz bottle served in a snifter a - lovely amber color with a chill haze . i is topped with an inch and a half of beige head . s - the nose seems more caramel malt than hops . i do get some mild citrus . t - awfully malt-centric . the hops are almost an afterthought . the alcohol is well hidden though . m - moderate and smooth . not a lot of carbonation o - this is a dipa for the malt lovers .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.90 0.60	poured vigorously into a pint glass . a : cloudy - dark and stratified . super dark upper half and light golden lower half . very yeasty . s : peach smell , astringent , passion fruit notes t : upon first sip i thought it was very well balanced and not very imperially hoppy at all . i noticed a florally bitter taste , with some pine taste coming through . as i continued to drink , the beer got considerably more bitter and finished as a strong example of a double ipa ! m : dry and bitter , exactly what i expect from a dipa d : i could maybe have another .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	relatively inoffensive macro-swill . pours a dark golden color with a huge off-white foamy head . smells like husked corn with a bit of offputting rancid bitterness . taste is surprisingly bitter , with that weird almost rancid/vegetable bitterness overlaying the familiar cheap lager/malt liquor sweetness that is reminiscent of corn mixed with bubbles and disappointment . quenched my thirst . forgettable , but not abysmal .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	i 've seen this one around everywhere but never tried it so i figured it was about time to give it a go ... . well , this certainly looks the part of a stout ... its dark black with a creamy head ... its a little thin but other than that , it looks pretty good ... i 'm definitely getting the chocolate in the nose here.. that and a little belgian yeast that has my interest piqued.. i think i can smell some vanilla as well but its mostly cocoa and yeast ... well , this is a bit of a letdown ... the chocolate is n't nearly as prevalent as i hoped it would be ... its basically an ale with a little bit of chocolate to it ... i can detect the belgian yeast as well.. not nearly as good as i was hoping here ...

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	a well-done over-hopped barleywine . certainly not my favorite style , but very nicely made and complex . dark red body verges on the look of red wine , besides the yeast haze and huge beige head on top . the best thing about the bell 's beers is that they are not cocky in their complexity . they do not smack you in the face with the flavor . they saunter up to you , show you how good they are , then slowly walk away . this beer is no exception to that . smell hints at the strong american hops that are going to be dominant in flavor alongside the red fruits and black licorice . caramels and cocoa are secondary but still obvious . alcohol does not hide , but stays in its place as a flavor enhancer that does not steal the show . much more impressive than bigfoot , foghorn , etc . yet i want the hops to back off and let the malt shine . great and impressive , just not really my gig . muchos gracias senor sakaroo para el cerveza .

0.60 0.80 0.70 0.40 0.40	my notes here say `` wtf ? '' on this one . wtf indeed . interesting appearance , reddish hue - looks like a lager with food coloring in it . smells a heck of a lot better then it tastes . flavors of cranberries and maple syrup come through on this , but the cranberries seem really , really unnatural . i wonder if this used concentrated syrup instead of actual cranberries ?

0.70 0.80 0.30 0.60 0.60	even though it says to serve extra cold , i served this room temp so it may be the reason i wasnt very impressed . a- very cloudy ( which i dont really like ) and dark . head is a little less than one finger and looks very creamy , also it retains well s- very nice smell , you can sense chocolaty and coffee-ey aromas . t- a lot of coffee flavor-imo too much- but otherwise pleasing tastes m- mine is very flat ( i think because of the room temp serve ) and therefore is not pleasing to my mouth d- its pretty much like water , so it gets a 5 if you are looking at bud light 's definition of drinkability

0.80 0.20 0.60 0.20 0.20	poured a bottle of this into an ommagang glass . smelled the sulfur from a foot away . the beer must have been very old , but it 's the brewery 's fault for the green bottle . green bottles need to be outlawed . i took one sip and thought of pouring it out , but then realized i could pretend it was really good and get my friend to try it . he promptly ran to the sink to wash his mouth out . yes , it was that bad . unless you 're positive it 's fresh , do n't buy this beer . i have never had a worse experience .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	this is a very interesting beer . it 's very hoppy but has a belgian feel to it , like a hoppy saisson . never had anything quite like it . worth trying . i had it on tap at a distributor event at blind tiger in nyc . the taste is fantastic , but the beer is a little thin and a bit hot ; not a good session beer , but great type of brew to have after a long day .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	lightly hazed , brilliant amber/bronze cast , slim off-white head . vibrant aromatics , blistering pine , lively citrus notes , lemon and orange , ... everything you want in an ipa . all that and more in the mouth , with a blazing path blown across the palate . medium to full body , with a plump hoppy juiciness , accompanied by potent hop bitterness . gets more intense , and more pleasurable , for this hop-head , the further we go in the glass . chinook , centennial , & columbus hop , bright and citrus-y , plentiful bitterness , 2-row barley , dark aromatic , caramel malt provides a sturdy base . zesty stuff , custom made for a hop addict like me . i do n't think i 'd agree with adam a. about it 's sessionability ( 8.5 % , really ) , in fact , i 'd really enjoy this at about 2 % less alcohol . thoroughly enjoyable ipa . `` dank , brutally iber , resinous '' is right . if they could do this in 6-packs of 12 ounce bottles , i 'd be even happier .

0.50 0.50 0.40 0.70 0.60	pours a solid brown where light passes through on the edge . no head beyond the thin layer of micro-bubbles on the edge of the glass . absolutely no lace . sweet molasses and brown sugar smell ; no noticeable hop . really too coyingly sweet , even for a dark beer . a little better balance on the taste . not quite as sweet as the smell would indicate . slight cardboard in the swallow . a touch of hop in the swallow , nearly no aftertaste . the body is very thin -- like there was a lot of adjuncts added . the carbonation is too high for this style . this may be one of the more interesting beers in the wine-loving country of spain . however , its mass-appeal style is not my style . it is different from the ubiquitous light lagers of the world .

0.40 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.60	pours a sort of raisiny chestnut color , with a rather unspectacular head that dies down and in the end it looked flat . the aroma is fruit and sweet malt . a lot of yeasty funk . and ... um ... um ... .this is a chimay and i feel like i should be picking up a lot and saying things like `` notes of this '' and `` nuances of that '' but really , brought up to temperature and right until the end where it was practically room temperature , the aroma just seemed muted . the most notable thing about the taste is it 's a bit astringent with a slightly metallic like quality to it . sweet sugary malt and raisins are rounded out with a bit of spice and belgian yeast . finished quick . estery and medicinal . dry but almost a tinge of sugar sticks around . the alcohol hits the back of my throat in not a good way . medium body . good carbonation . probably the best part of this beer . this was n't at all the wow beer i was expecting .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.70 0.70	1997 , 1999 , 2005 . the aroma is very sweet but not cloying . it 's got dark fruit , caramel , vinous qualities , oak , and rum . the appearance is nice too with some haze to a dark copper gold . the flavor is like the aroma but a little bit astringent . the palate is smooth and thick as heck . overall a nice beer . the 97 had a bit of coffee and the 99 was the sweetest .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	beer pours an orange copper color with a tan 1 finger head . lacing remains throughout the brew . resembles a fine amber ale . smell is very much like that of banana bread with a little bit of hoppiness to remind you its still a beer . banana is fresh and not syrupy smelling which is very much appreciated . bread like malts which hold up to the name banana bread since they are really bready like an english ale . after reading the label we find out about the crystal malts , a staple of english ales . the english golding hops really compliment the banana very well as they are both generally sweet , but that fibrous sweet ; banana and golding hops both have a bland , earthy sweetness prefered by many who otherwise do n't care for sweet things . bananas and malts also go together well . mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing . the picture on the bottle shows a dark beer with a large creamy head . this brew is short of an amber ale in color and thin as a lager . for once might recommend nitrous oxide for this brew since its more of a dessert beer . if we 're talking about banana bread here , then it should be thicker , like bread . if i found this in a pub i could drink it all night . its a sweet beer that 's not overly sweet . i 'm not really for or against fruit beers , i just appreciate when they are done well , and this one tastes like really bananas not natural/artificial banana flavoring . not bad at all .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.80 0.80	a- very tiny brown head on a big black body . reminds me of a stout . s- also reminds me of a stout . roasted malts , slight alcohol , slight anise , slight chocolate . t- man , this is very similar to a stout . roasted malts , mild coffee aftertaste , and the warming of alcohol m- maybe a little over carbonated and a little thinner than i expected . not bad though d- if i had a blind taste test id swear this is a stout . its something i could drink a few of in a night , but not one ill always have on hand

0.40 0.70 0.20 0.40 0.50	thanks to my parents for remembering me on their trip to pittsburgh . into some old mug from murphy 's in champagne . a - pale , watery amber body with big , rocky white head that disappears to nothing ( not even a thin ring ) very quickly . s - good balance between anise , herbal spiciness and caramel malt sweetness . some leather says my wife . pretty much what i expect from an amber lager . t - not the most full-flavored beer i 've ever had . very mild dry pilsener malt flavor at first , with some even more mild toasted malt flavors adding some sweetness . spiciness form the hops comes in right at the swallow , and combined with the anise sweetness gives this beer some semblance of flavor before it dies into this club soda-esque finish ... m - very watery body , with carbonation that made me think i was drinking coke from a fountain . d - i 've had this beer a couple of times now , and i can say now that i see why it is a cult beer . it 's not really that good , but better than the bmc 's , around the same price , and has local appeal . that being said , it 's just not a very impressive beer . it does do some things right ( i love how some ambers pick up anise notes ) , but does so many things wrong ( body , finish , lack of flavor ... ) honestly , i 'd rather have the new schlitz ( surprisingly good beer ... )

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	16.9 oz brown bottle with no freshness date . appearance : faintly hazed yellow hue , looks like iced green tea . lacing is fine but nothing special . smell : not much in the aroma , a touch lemony with an underlying grain huskiness . taste : big lemony hop , hay like bitter bite with and herbal flavour that is quite rustic & # 8230 ; harsh in a way . lean in the malt department , just a whole bunch of husky grain and a dash of vague dextrins . harshness stays as the dry finish comes around . mouthfeel : trademark lager crispness and smoothness , light bodied and dry . drinkability & notes : flavours are a bit of a problem for the taste buds as the harshness kicks in , the off flavours are just enough to be noticed but not enough to be unbearable . sort of like that milk that is past expiration but you still pour it on your cereal any way .

0.70 0.60 0.50 0.80 0.60	good beer . has a maple aroma when poured . medium carbonation , tastes like autumn . slightly sweet , almost fruity . medium hops , and a mild malty taste . crisp beer with a tad bit too much watery and metallic aftertaste . with more grains , this could be a righteous beer .

0.40 0.70 0.20 0.40 0.30	a= the head is about 1 finger and falls very quickly . its a reddish color and no bubbles are seen in the beer ... eww s= candy malts , coffee and butterscotch . not bad t= first is a milky malt , then a slight coffee flavor finished with a little hop bitterness . after this my overall impression was just dirty water m= dirty water d= low . i could barely finish it ... close to a drain pour

0.80 1.00 0.50 0.80 0.50	southern hemisphere pours a medium amber color , which is surprisingly clear . the head was slightly off white , large , and had great retention . the smell was overwhelming . the pine floral smell that is expected with an apa is there and in a extremely strong manner . its taste was amazingly strong , similar to the smell , but very bitter . although it has a nice sweet undertone which makes it unique . the mouthfeel had a nice body as expected . the carbonation feel is mostly washed out by the extreme bitterness . southern hemisphere is worth a try , but definitely fits its bill as a seasonal fun on occasion type of beer .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60	a - poured into a pint where a decent head followed . good lace on the brew and actually some stickies on the glass . looks of your typical macro : straw yellow . s - nice blend of malts and hops . a musty and skunky odor is mixed in as well . t - not bad.nice light malt flavor but the end of the swig and aftertaste are metallic . nice dash of hops in the middle as well . m - good carbonation and it finishes clean . nicely balanced here . good light to medium mouthfeel . d - this is not a bad lager . better than average at least so i would n't mind throwing a few down at a social event . i probably would not go out of my way to buy this . in fact i bought this because it was on sale and also had a manufacturer 's coupon to go with it . ; d

0.70 0.40 1.00 0.80 0.80	a : pours a jet black with a deep tan head . looks like dr pepper but with better head retention . a bit of lacing s : dark malts , roasted malt and dark dried fruits . sweet with a bit of alcohol . not much coffee t : starts sharp with some roasty malts . a bit of bitterness from the malts in the middle . chocolate and a sweet flavor , followed by a bit of earthy and slightly citrusy hop flavor . mild bitterness from the hops . coffee towards the end becomes more prevalent as the brew warms along with a smooth chocolate . m : very smooth and full bodied with a low carbonation . overall a pretty nice brew . very smooth and full of flavor . not as much coffee as i expected but i 'd rather have it this way than overpowering everything . you could tell me this was a chocolate stout and i 'd never know the wiser . great stuff regardless .

0.90 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.50	barely opaque charred pecan with sparking highlights of garnet and gold . the butter toffee colored cap is a thing of beauty . the mass of sticky bubbles stays humped in the center as it falls , depositing an impressive amount of shotgun-blasted lace in its wake . the nose is n't very stout-like and i ca n't appreciate the 'ruby port wine ' at all . those are pretty big faults for a port wine-added stout , would n't you say ? no off-aromas ( other than an initial hint of metal ) keeps the score from falling even lower . i 'm still not impressed . tors is one of the least flavorful stouts that i 've run across in a very long time . i know that it 's english and i know that the abv is less than 5 % , but still . where the hell is the port ? a wee bit of berry-like tanginess on the back end is the only evidence ... or it could just be my imagination . that 'stored in a stainless steel drum ' character is still present . a shortage of malt means that roasted flavors are at a minimum , as is sweetness . bitterness is definitely present and is almost crushed aspirin-like in its sharpness . my first thought was that i 'm drinking old beer , but the 'best by ' date is still several months off . my second thought is that i 'm drinking poorly crafted beer . there 's no way that a stout of any kind should have a body this spindly . in fact , ruby stout is too thin for a beer of any style . well , maybe not for a light lager , but that 's about it . with very few malt sugars to run interference , it is n't surprising that the carbonation favors ( lightly ) fizzy . i did n't expect great things out of the original ruby stout , but i sure as hell expected more than this . the idea of adding port to stout is appealing because , if done right , the resulting beer could be both interesting and good . if done wrong , as here , the result is a chore to finish . if you want to see this brewery at their best , go with royal oak pale ale .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 1.00	very simply -- -if this were n't a trader joe 's beer , it would have higher marks -- i 'd bet anything . at least here on the west coast , there are no examples of this style , at any price point , that compare to this beer . heater-allen , the only contender in oregon , way more expensive and neither as good , nor as consistent as this beer . while not in class with the best german hefeweizens , it 's damn close and an absolute steal for the price .

0.80 0.50 0.90 0.70 0.60	appearance : the good retention , tall head , and unique label give it an overall pleasing apperance , but the color leaves something to be desired . smell : aromas of malt , hops , and fruit . not bad.. taste : it has a nice earthy taste and a great balance . nothing acidic left in the mouth . mouthfeel : it feels like silk going over the tongue ; it has a pop at the end , a bit of gingerale . drinkability : this is a good cream ale but is slightly lacking in flavor . it 's worth trying .

0.60 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	poured from bottle into a stemless red wine glass . the color looks about right for an abbey-style ale - a rich , nearly opaque ruby-mahogany . the absence of any real head reminds me this is certainly no bottle-conditioned belgian delight . the nose is dark and vaguely fruity , with plum , fig , clove , allspice , and molasses or brown sugar . the palate is not unpleasant , with plenty of that molasses , clove , and dried fruit and some decent maltiness , but this beer is very light in body ( hence my unusually low `` mouthfeel '' score - i rarely dock or add points here unless there is significant deviation from stylistic expectations ) . the finish lies somewhere between `` clean '' and `` nonexistent . '' overall , a pleasant if boring spiced winter ale . an abbey-style ale it is not , nor should it pretend to be . but for a mass-produced beer that i can find in any grocery store in town , it 's pleasantly quaffable .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.40	500ml bottle . appearance : cloudy , brownish amber . thick , off white head receding to a foam and thick rim but leaving no lacing . highly visible carbonation . aroma : pronounced christmas cake aroma , honey , treacle , cinnamon , allspice . something unbalanced in here as well , however , like smelling someone else 's after-poor-quality-beer alcohol breath . taste : christmas cake , sweet and rich , spiced , soft malt . very gently vinous . reminiscent of wychwood bah humbug . definitely successful in achieving the english style they claim . the 7 % abv is hidden well . however , that unpleasant aspect of the aroma is also evident ( although not as obviously ) in the taste . mouthfeel : medium bodied , but lingers on the roof of the mouth . soft . drinkability : nice flavours , but a shame about the offputting aspects of the aroma and taste . they 're on the right track with this beer , but perhaps they need to refine their brewing techniques . at this moment in time , i wo n't be drinking this one again .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	all in all not a horrid product from swill-producing a-b , but at the same time not what i would buy when faced with other options in the dry-stout category . poured a near opaque black with a nice cascading nitro effect and a creamy head . what lies underneath that head is the problem . it is entirely too thin for a stout . there are some good hints of flavor here with some malt , chocolate and coffee thrown in there , but they do n't make up for this beer 's shortcomings in texture . but , since a-b is n't know for producing much besides swill , that earns this beer a few extra points in my book . i would n't be opposed to having another one if there was nothing else of interest on tap .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.90	clear maroon with pink highlights . half finger head settles to a ring . smells strongly of sour blueberries and wine grapes . a strong whiff brings up an acid character , too . first impression is almost mouth puckering sourness . dry red wine undertones . the main fruits here are blackberries and blueberries . mouthfeel excels . medium body , and feels strongly carbonated , almost like a sparkling wine . overall i really enjoyed this . it has a really nice fruit concentrate like sourness . i think most wine lovers might appreciate this .

0.30 0.60 0.20 0.40 0.40	pours like a sprite , loud and fizzy w/ tons of carbonation and a 1.5 finger head that 's got huge fizzy bubbles just like a soda . straw color body punctuated by bubble streams . head thins to halo and a smattering of lacing . does n't look like beer at all , more like ginger ale . aroma is of sweet malt , grain and corn , some tart sugar notes like an apricot . tastes of toasted malt , very highly carbonated with sharp bubbles that fizz out so that the swallow is like swallowing an air bubble . the taste is n't too bad , very much like a blonde , but there 's some alcohol flavor that comes through that 's not too desirable . of the 4 jerome beers i 've had , this is definitely the weakest .

0.80 0.40 0.20 0.20 0.30	this beer was good from the perspective that it exceeded my expectations from a cost-to-value perspective . i picked it up on a lark because it was soooo cheap at discount liquor . i expected a pale economy lager all other budget beers i can think of . what i got was something that actually seemed a bit bock-like . the bad news ? it was not a bock i liked ! truer to style than other budget beers might be , but still not really worth buying or drinking , no matter the price . it was dark brown but brilliant and sparkling , with a fine white head . i started to think that maybe this cheap beer would n't be so bad ... price is n't everything after all . aroma was diacetyl , metal , and some caramel . flavor was not good ... malted milk ball graininess with some sourness that i really do n't think was supposed to be there . pretty awful . mouthfeel was thin . most of this went down the drain . i would not recommend this beer . i have several more in the fridge awaiting their eventual disposal , which will not be via mine ( nor anyone else 's ) stomach . i bought this at discount liquor in milwaukee .

0.50 0.40 0.60 0.30 0.40	bottle poured into pilsner glass . smells like corn but kind of stale . dark yellow in color , head almost non-existent . taste sour and stale . not pleasant at all . served ice-cold which didnt help mask the taste . no aftertaste and very light . i will stick with the other american lager standards in the future .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.90 0.90	found this in a bevmo recently sitting on the shelf . did n't get around to trying it before , so i picked it up since it 's retired . poured into a la fin du monde tulip . fat 3 finger off white head . dark black with amber hues towards the outer edges . head snap , crack , and pops its way down to a decent foam cap . the nose is pretty much composed of a semi tart fruity ester ( apple ) fragrance . i get some raspberries as well , and a hint of lactose . the taste begins with a slightly lactic sweetness reminiscent of a milk stout that gives way to roasted almost chocolaty malts . the flavor ends on a fruity apple/raspberry note with a hint of champagne like tartness . smokey sweet malts linger . the mouthfeel is light bodied with a high level of biting carbonation ( the carbonation is the only part of this beer that i 'm not too fond of ) . quite dry due to the high level of carbonation . a very interesting beer that seems to march to the beat of it 's own drummer . i ca n't think of a single beer it is similar to . i 'm kind of sad that i did n't get around to trying this earlier as it is a really nice and different beer that i would definitely buy more of if it were available .

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.50	i have the mom version the head was initially strong , though sudsy and it fell quickly . hazy gold color with a streak of amber . carbonation is plentiful from the surface of the brew come hop aromas -- minty and herbal -- and coriander . it does n't smell as though an authentic yeast was used , which fits my preconceived notions for rogue 's methods the flavor confirms my american yeast suspicions . light fruity flavors , strong hop contributions , though little spice .

0.90 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.90	appearence : pours a very attractive , hazy orangish-amber with a huge , frothy white head that lasts forever . smell : the smell is very fruity and yeasty , with a nice amount of floral hoppiness in the background . taste and mouthfeel : smooth , crisp , and quick . the flavors are a bit light , and so is the mouthfeel , but its very balanced , unoffensive , and interesting . a little bit spicy as well . almost a wit , but not quite . drinkability and overall : a very good single , with enough drinkability to be sipped on all day . definitly recommended if you want a quality belgian session ale .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.60	north coast is a incredibly good brewery in my opinion , but this one is not one of their best ones ' . looks really nice though ! deep brown/reddish color with a nice big beige head which soon settles to a nice lid of foam . aroma is good of gingersnaps , rosted malts and some fruitiness . the taste though is a bit overwhelmed by alcoholish-taste , which is a bit sad . but there are some really nice and exciting flavours going on in there of gingersnaps , rosted malts and some toffee . another `` bad thing '' about this one is that i think it 's a bit `` over-hopped '' for the style . all and all , a good beer . i think a couple of years in the beer-cellar might round this one of and make it a wonderful beer .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.40 0.20	a -- slightly cloudy noticeable bits of unrecognizable `` stuff '' floating in suspension . small , quickly disappearing head . s -- not very pronounced . faintly smells of malt t -- overall sweet and slightly malty . alcohol is very present for such a low abv brew . m -- thin with a little fizzy carbonation d-a drain-pour for me . the bits of unrecognizable `` stuff '' in the beer was too much for me . if it was n't for that , i would have had trouble finishing it with the overpowering alcohol flavor .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	0.5 liter bottle for 50 rubles . pretty ok as these russian beers go . poured from the bottle , i got a thick rocky head that left a little lace as it dwindled . color is hazy straw . theres a brisk hefe smell , with some subdued banana that comes back in the , um , belch . well balanced hop profile . doesnt stand up to other hefes , but for $ 1.67 at a hotel bar , whadaya want ?

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	pours a hazy brown amber with a lumpy off-white head . sweet malts are offset by crisp hops together producing a wonderful balance and mouthfeel . sooo smooth ! certainly one of the better mcneill 's brews available , and the real label leads me to believe that this one is being exported from our lovely state of vermont . snag one if you see it .

0.90 0.70 0.40 0.70 0.70	pour from the nitro-can produces a lovely large head that 's lots of fun to watch settle into its impeccably creamy final state . solid black color that definitely wo n't let any light through . lacey residue already forming with the verrry sllllowly dropping head . a very good looking beer . aroma of toasted grains , light smoke , toffee . a milk/cream sweetness seems to be lingering in the background . soft , somewhat watery and barely detectable carbonation greets the mouth first , even before the flavor asserts itself . i do n't think i 'll ever get used to this very english beer texture , if i have n't acquired the feel for it by now . about as enjoyable as a flat soda . but the flavor is nice , with burnt grains , butter , caramel and coffee grounds pleasing the palate . finish keeps the burned/smoky flavor rolling . hardly exceptional , but enjoyable enough . not one i 'd reach for often , as i do n't dig the mouthfeel on these sorts of beers . damn it , i 've tried . there are better stouts out there , but the two remaining cans wo n't go unappreciated .

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.40 0.40	appearance : dark mocha head : insane ! luscious , frothy , over-the-rim-without-spilling aroma : plums and perfume taste : coffee and burnt rubber , with a piney hop finish ; the alcohol is well-hidden . mouthfeel : well-carbonated , as expected from the heady pour drinkability : low- i could n't get over the tire flavor , which is a shame because every other aspect of the beer was delightful

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	12 oz bottle , this one was the 'edgy ' black label with a cricket poured into a tall glass and took on a nice bubbly head , a bright straw color full of carbonation ... damn near transparent , i can count the bubbles from underneath looking up through the glass woody , mild , some flowery smell taste is mild , malty , corn , a bit lemon then finishes with more hops than you anticipate for a lager , leaves you with a slight bitterness you almost miss.. actually not bad thin , really thin , not gypsy curse thin but thin ... moderately carbonated , you could drink this with really heavy food.. i never drink lager , but i wanted a lighter beer for a barbecue that i could share with less discerning palates ... i could prolly drink them hmmm ... all day ? maybe 36 hours straight ? if i had a kid i would bring these to its & lt ; insert sport here & gt ; game and sit my lawn chair outside the fence so some school official did n't bother me while i drank them and jeered the other kids for being so much less talented than mine and the coach for not fully recognizing the sheer athletic prowess of my spawn , then id go home and drink more while i berated my kid for ruining my second chance at living through them with their obvious lack of hustle and focus

0.60 0.60 0.90 0.80 0.80	a dark straw yellow with no head whatsoever s smells of grainy malt and citrus hops t tastes of light , crisp citrusy hops and a lot of pine with some grainy and a touch of bready malts . nicely balanced and flavorful for a pale ale . m nice carbonation with a full body d this was a very nice pale ale . good drinkibility , especially at $ 2 a pop on-tap .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.90	a : this was 100 % black , no highlights . it pours with a medium sized , short lived , very dark brown head . s : warm dark fruit aromas of plums and raisins , almost sherry like . the malty chocolate aromas smell almost burnt . the yeasty aromas are distinctly `` belgian '' , i ca n't think of a better word unfortunately . t : plenty of mildly tart warmth permeates every part of this one . the rich , very dark chocolate and boozy dark fruits are in perfect harmony . m : an incredibly thick body and big , foamy carbonation . i love the way this feels . d : in only five months , this has mellowed quite a bit . this is fantastic now , but i think time will do wonders to it .

0.80 0.40 0.40 0.70 0.40	poured into a pint glass . a : pours a hazy golden orange color with medium-thick cream-colored foam that fades at a medium pace , leaving chunks of lacing around the glass . s : smells like grass and spent grains . definitely leaves something to be desired . t : big malted barley flavors come through despite the muted nose . caramel , toffee , nuts , toast , etc . are in season . better than average , but not really good . m : drinks a little bit like soda . not a ton of body , and my still feels fizzy after i finish swallowing . d : while it does have some nice flavor going on , the mouthfeel is pretty much enough to say goodnight for me . i 'd drink this before a budweiser , but not much else .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	bottle . pours a dark brown/black color with a slight tan head that collars around the inside rim of the glass . strong cocoa aroma mixed with some malt type sweetnes . the taste is not at all what i expected and to be honest , not very good , lots of leather , tobacco , and an overly charred roast cocoa flavor that really kills this beer . ends fairly dry with a lingering bitterness . overall , not a good beer and am surprised as i enjoy most other foothills beers .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	visual appeal : a bubbly , misty bar of shining gold , appealing streaks , almost continuous effervescence smell : very reminiscent of hard apple cider , mild hop aroma , strong yeast , really grew on me as beer warmed flavor : pilsner malts and bohemian hops and very strong cloudy yeast flavor lingers a long time , feel warmth of alcohol on back of palette , hints of citrus but not strong enough , i 'd prefer this a little sweeter , however mouthfeel : lovely effervescence plays with whole of tongue drinkability : heavy abv -- sipping beer , definitely would not drink more than one at a time my first ever belgian ale , right before the yank memorial day weekend , and i 'm definitely feeling it ( the ale , that is . ) i have `` gained a level . '' combined with spicy tacos , and not a good choice . beer became bitterer . lager would have beer better .

0.70 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40	this beer pours a hazy yellow color with a moderate head and some lacing on the glass . the aroma was similar to the delirium noel but with not as much spice . bartender tapped it into a really cool delirium tremens goblet that had the pink elephants on it . the flavor was a little strong at first , but i got used to it after a few drinks ( maybe the alcohol numbed my tastebuds ) . i really did n't care much for the flavor because the spicyness was too strong and the wheat/yeast flavor was too prominent .

0.90 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.50	12 oz bottle . pours a dark brown black with a large creamy brown head that retains well and laces the glass . the aroma is sweet chocolate malts , some acidic coffee and some smoke . it all washes out quickly other than acidic leather . the flavor is roasted malts with very acidic coffee and a burnt bitterness at the end . the mouthfeel is medium bodied and la little watery . overall , i remember liking previous bottle much more than this . this one seems to have a lot of off notes and is very acidic .

0.60 0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90	a- dark amber color but not a lot of head . head actually appears when you swirl it . but once you do it has some nice lacing . but if you do n't swirl it then there is not much happening . s- hops and caramel with a hint of sweet vanilla . t- light hops but strong on the caramel . chocolate notes , sweet with a little bitter on the end . m- thin and smooth with almost not carbonation feel . kind of has the texture of a flat soda . o- personally i think this was a great beer . disappeared really quick . wish i had another one .

0.70 0.70 0.80 0.60 0.40	22 oz . bottle into a snifter ; no freshness date p : poured out rich gold from the bottle , and sits a hazy deep amber with tangerine highlights . 1 1/2 inch head was off-white , tightly compacted , and frothy . it did disappear pretty quickly to form a halo on top , with not much lacing . a : bready malts , citrusy & earthy hops , yeast , toffee , caramel , and alcohol ... lots of alcohol ! . t : starts with sweet caramel malts , a little toasted barley , and a hop kick made up of mostly grapefruit & orange peels . malts are definitely on the top layer of flavors , but the hops do a commendable job of providing a backdrop to the grain bill . the middle gives rise to some good toffee flavors and an insane alcohol presence that blisters the tongue throughout the rest of the experience . the finish is dry and features a hint of yeast , while being joined by the ever-building creshendo of alcohol that sets a 4 alarm blaze in the chest and throat . m : full-bodied and viscious , yet smooth with a bit of graininess . gently carbonated . d : the 11.26 % abv , and heavy presence thereof , puts a bit of a damper on things in this department . 22 oz . 's was a struggle . notes : this is way too boozy for me to consider it a good example of the style . i mean , i understand that barleywines are supposed to be sippers , but the overwhelming ethanol just ruins this beer when it 's this fresh . had some good flavors and that signature stone character to it , but it feels really raw right now . i need to buy another to age , as i think that would really help to mellow the alcohol and unwrap some of the more subtle flavors . not recommended when fresh !

1.00 0.80 0.90 0.60 0.60	this is really a gorgeous looking beer . humongous fluffy head , lots of lacing , excellent head retention . held up to the light reveals a ruby red / burgundy color . the aroma is overwhelming of hops . when they say they dry hop this beer , they are n't kidding . grapefruit dominates with pine resin underneath . after a few swirls , some espresso and hot chocolate appear . hops are on the forefront of the tongue . grapefruit pith , some herbalness . this beer is really going into ipa territory . coffee , charcoal , dark chocolate flavors come up after warming up a bit . i love the mouthfeel of this beer . its not watery as some american porters might be . i prefer porters to have more maltiness and not be lost in the hop bitterness , though .

0.60 0.90 0.60 1.00 0.90	growler pour . aroma : coffee , chocolate , sugary syrup in the aroma . appearance : black and opaque , very little head . taste : very sweet . dark chocolate and caramel . there 's some roasty notes in the foretaste . there 's a little bitterness , which comes out more on the aftertaste . mouthfeel : medium body , smooth and creamy . drinkability : this is quite a delicious dessert beer . i believe it 's best enjoyed fresh , because i had a bottle before that tasted nothing like this fresh growler .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70	overall not a bad american stab at the style . basically brite beer with a few white chunks , a fine golden ale with a tight white head . mild banana esters and sweet pale malt on the nose . strange mouthfeel ; i feel that the body is a bit thin and the carb is low . maybe a bit too attenuated . lots of sweet pale malt , probably should have used more pilzen malt . a bit too dry for my tastes . a good beer , though . was expecting more hops for the brewery . for my money i 'll stick to hairy eyeball or vote to bring back kill ugly radio . cheers !

0.80 0.80 0.60 1.00 0.70	had on draft at beer table , brooklyn . would be very curious to try in a bottle , but the draft was too cool to pass up ( only 3 barrels filled ? ! ) . slightly opaque deep red color with a quick dissapating head . strong sour woody smell masked the big booze almost entirely . sour grape and slight rotten fruit taste ( in the best possible way ) . rich lingering woody aftertaste and puckering sour mouthfeel . amazing bev , ill have to get a bottle to age .

1.00 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.70	indigo ink blackness in a tulip with a dense taunt light brown foamy cap that is well retained , despite the mammoth abv . ominous black hole like pours are to be reveared . dark cake like scents first hit the nose . toasted malts are detectable , but sweetsugars overtake the usual stout aromas . first swigs : roasted chewy espresso malts like someone dumped coffee grinds into my brew . awl-kee-hawl punch hits me straight in the kisser . rummy hot , even while cooled just above fridge temps . the fusel nature gives me shivers . over ripe vodka soaked bananas and some maraschino cherry & cocoa notes . rock n rye quality rolls on and on here . overall , the booze takes the wheel on this out of control joyride . thick syrup feel . just a slight smidge of carbonation manages to struggle free here . needs to be at 50 degrees . drinkability is hampered by the tongue lashing that this delivers . dfh has flexed their brewing muscles and the referee has counted to ten . last swigs : tongue numbing vodka infused stout . goes through a rainbow of flavors while the temperature spectrum advances . $ 8.25 for a 12 ozer . beer is good . happy beering .

0.60 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.60	bomber . slightly hazy gold , with a faint hint of pink . large off-white head , which dissolved rapidly . aroma was spicy , almost belgian-like . it was quite phenolic/medicinal in smell . taste was tart and citrusy . this led to a good bit of bitterness in the aftertaste . in keeping with the aroma , there was a medicinal flavor which mellowed as it warmed , but never really went away . finish included some pepper/spice , probably due to alcohol . light in body and highly carbonated . had quite a nip to it , almost like champagne . overall , ok. my second beer from hitachino , and i have n't been that impressed . might go well with sushi , though , given it 's champagne like qualities .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60	got this as a very generous extra from bs870621345 ( thanks ! ) . poured from a 12oz bottle at cellar temp into a snifter . a- pours a very deep black with a respectable head for the style . it dissipates quickly , however , and left no lace . s- sweet , dark fruits . the lack of coffee and chocolate notes typical of the style was surprising . a load of alcohol covers up most complexities . t- an atypical imperial stout . dark fruits head up the charge followed by a punch-in-the-face roasted bitterness . the combo of lactic sweetness and the bitter finish do n't mesh well . a lack of complexity is off-putting as well . m- good carbonation and substantial body , not bad here . d- not great due to the roasted bitterness . i enjoy bitter hop bombs but this bitterness is a different monster . overall , i am extremely glad i was able to try this beer but i do n't think i would seek it out again .

0.40 0.20 0.70 0.30 0.30	12 oz . bottle from october ... something , poured into a duvel tulip . courtesy of therealnomayo 's hookup . i 'll admit that i was reticent going into this beer : just a few days earlier , i 'd opened up a pretty revolting bottle of peruvian morning . let 's see what this coffee-forward central waters offering holds . it 's black , no light escapes the glass . a half-finger light tan head dissipates quickly , leaving only a ring of lace on the surface of the beer . almost no residual lacing afterwards . the aroma of this beer is oddly , sickeningly reminiscent of that peruvian morning i previously reviewed . vegetables . corn chips . maybe some chocolate , but where is the coffee ? imagine if all of the aromatic descriptors that bas throw around when reviewing cantillons actually sucked thats sort of what this smells like . fetid pond water , actual horse blankets , festering cabbage . i imagine that the globe theater smelled like this after particularly poor performances of shakespearean works . the taste is a slight improvement on the smell . coffee and lingering bitterness , but that characteristic has clearly faded . theres a strange , prune-like taste in the mix . the aftertaste is pretty rank , sour and bitter all at once . again , this is a disaster . ill give this to central waters : the mouthfeel is decent . for a beer this high in abv it could stand a little more viscosity , but at least the carbonation is pretty on point . am i getting old bottles ? do central waters beers drop off incredibly quickly ? the two coffee beers i 've had from this brewery have both been among the worst beers i 've drank . i will hold out hope for other non-coffee offerings from them .

0.60 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.70	bottle courtesy of dkachur , poured into a duvel tulip glass . appearance : a really murky , hazy reddish orange brown beer , with a white head of average retention and splotchy , speckly lacing . nothing too impressive . aroma : smells , quite literally , like pure caramel malt wort , with belgian spices and bananas . bananas foster anyone ? slight alcohol too , which does n't hurt the foster smell . sticky , syrupy , thick , and sweet smelling . taste : deeply roasted , sticky malts , spicy phenols and hop bitterness and spiciness , a few light stone fruit notes and belgian spices . perhaps some slight papery oxidation , as well . only slightly above average . mouthfeel : silky and smooth , creamy , buttery , medium-bodied , nice . drinkability : not bad , but not too impressive . the aroma is pleasant , but the sheer quantity of yeast rendered the appearance unattractive and the taste was a little bland . on the other hand , the mouthfeel and aroma were very nice . alcohol is a little high and also , a little noticeable .

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	pours a black color . 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color . great retention and slight lacing . smells of sweet malt , roasted malt , hint of chocolate , and hops . fits the style of a milk / sweet stout . mouth feel is smooth and clean , with a low carbonation level . tastes of sweet malt , hint of a roasted malt , hint of hop , hint of chocolate , and a hint of pale malt . overall , decent appearance , great feel , and good body .

0.50 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	i picked up a batch of this today at the grocery store as it seemed to look like a good summer brew . as it turns out , it 's not a bad beer , but my only complaint is it seems more on the lemonade side than the wheat ale side . appearance is a pallid yellow much resembling lemonade with barely , if not , almost any head whatsoever . smell is high in lemons with a hint of wheat . it has that candy lemon smell , much like lemonheads , as another reviewer put it . taste was pretty good . as i said before , this stuff comes off more like an alcoholic lemonade than an actual beer . it 's a good experiment , as it is good , but there 's too much lemon and not enough wheat . mouthfeel was pretty watery and went down quickly . nothing to savor after the first sip of the brew . drinkability is n't bad at all . for a hot summer day , this stuff can certainly fix the thirst for a while and it 's a good `` warm up '' beer for those who have n't had much beer before . it 's a good brew for a hot summer day , but it 's more like a glorified lemonade . why not ? summer 's here !

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.80	poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a samuel adams boston lager glass . appearance : pours a translucent , pale brown color . has a small , frothy head that dissipates quickly down to a nice cap and leaves a nice ring of lacing . smell : has a citrus/pine hops smell with a significant , sweet , malty background aroma . taste : aggressively hoppy up front with piney flavors that develop quickly into a sweet , malty flavor with a strong , hoppy finish . mouthfeel : light-to-medium body with low carbonation . overall : a fairly decent apa . this style gets done a lot and it 's certainly been done better than this . nevertheless , this is a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of it from an underrated and under-known craft brewer .

1.00 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	a- dark brown , with a huge tan head that stays around forever ! s- coffee , malty caramel t- more coffee , chocolate , caramel and a little alcohol in there too m- medium bodied , a little watery really , decent carbonation d- a great example of a porter , just the wateriness that draws back from it

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60	glass : pint glass temp : cellared @ approx 45 degrees nice , darker amber color . good head that leaves a nice bubbly film . decent lacing . slight detection of pumpkin . nice spice notes . cinnamon , nutmeg , and clove . malty sweetness . fairly typical for the style . slight pumpkin flavor . not as much as i 'd like . pie spices are prominant . allspice and nutmeg , mostly . good roasted malt flavor . slight sweetness of vanilla . slight smokey note on the back end . too waterey and thin , imo . could be much better with abit more body . sure , i 'd be able to drink this one , but i 'd rather have something else , i think .

0.50 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.70	i feel like i have now experienced the true port/lost abbey experience , this is the first one i 've had that is flat ... a : pours dark brown with caramel highlights , zero head even after stiff pour , some clarity s : nose is predominantly oak and vanilla , some char quality in there , stout base takes a back seat t : vanilla and bourbon again dominate , some ashy character in there along with light notes of leather and tobacco , a bit of of boozieness on the finish mf : low carbonation is an understatement , medium body o : good flavors here , the lack of carbonation takes away from the quality a bit , for the premium price tag , i would expect carbonation .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	12oz . poured very near black with a light brown head that was quick to dissipate and left minimal lacing on the glass . aromas were of chocolate and roasted malts ; rather sweet smelling . tastes were of bold dark chocolate , roasted malts , and a hint of coffee . finished nicely sweet with some milk chocolate as well . mouth-feel was velvety smooth and creamy . another solid brew from bell 's !

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.60	i have fond memories of this beer from years ago , ice cold from plastic cups while playing softball at one of my dad 's union picnics . i was about 12 , and even then i remember this one being inferior to some of the others my dad drank ( erlanger , lowenbrau , etc ) . anyways figured i 'd try it again . pretty much the same as a lot of the other macros , with little to distinguish itself . clear yellow color , fluffy white head , big carbonation , grains . but with a bear .

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.70 0.60	excessive cabonation supports a big fluffy white head above crystal clear golden amber beer . aroma is musty with german/ munich malt sweetness . smells a bit sugary , like something in a 40oz bottle . flavor isnt bad - certainly not great . more sugary malt up front and then it disapears into a grainy , hop bite that seems out of place in a bock style to me . nothing very interesting going on here . body is light and lacks complexity . finish is dry w/ another hint of german malt in the background .

0.80 0.60 0.50 0.80 0.80	milky white suds stack about a finger and a half on top of this brew and dissipate into a cocoa like covering of foam atop this clouded brew . a sweet and fermented citrus comes off this beer with a tiny bit yeast mixed in as well as a little bit of beer odor at the tail end of your inhale . citrus lights up my mouth and slowly moves into fermented fruity yeast leaving the palate wet not sticky . mouth feel is good the carbonation is spot on just a little to bubbly at the beginning of this brew . would be good with some salted pistachios .

0.50 0.20 0.30 0.30 0.80	12oz bottle a- pours a very light straw yellow color with a thin fizzy white head . s- the aroma is pretty non-existent . there are just hints of beer flavors in the aroma , but it pretty hard to pick up on them at times . t- the best way i can describe the taste is a water downed miller light . i never though i could taste a beer with less flavor than some of the ultra-light lagers , but this one takes the cake . i guess the good thing about this beer is that there really are n't any offensive or off-flavors , but that is probably because it is about the closest beer that i have tried to water . m- the mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated with a sharp prickly feel . d- i will give it a high score on drinkability because i could easily consume a high quantity of these without getting the least bit drunk . however , i do n't think i really would want to as i think i would just rather either a water or a beer with a little more flavor . i am not lying when i say that mgd 64 resembles bottled water . not a horrible beer in the sense of tasting bad , but definitely a bad beer in terms of lack of taste . i will pass on this offering in the future .

0.80 0.80 0.80 0.50 0.50	this beer is sort of the reverse of the maxwell house coffee ad - it was good until the last drop . aroma was crisp and clean . flavor was sharp and bright , with nice hops in abundance , somewhere between the overactive character of a west coast ipa and the more stolid hopping of an english variety . and then , at the very end , the beer crashed and burned . finishes with an unpleasant bitterness that hangs oddly at the back of the throat , throwing the whole beer sadly out of contention for enjoyment .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.50 0.50	a : pours a light golden color with a very small amount of frothy head . s : the main aroma seems to be yeast with this one . sort of smells earthy or musty as well . the aromas mix pretty well to make you wonder how this one will taste . t : unfortunately , the aftertaste seems to lend itself to the musty aroma . it dominates the overall flavor . the in mouth taste is rather pleasant with some nice spicing . however , the dry and bitter after taste ruined the experience for me . m : i really like the in mouth carbonation and thick feel . d : the aftertaste makes this one a sipper for me . i really hate that is dominates the entire experience .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	i found this 750ml brown bottle at the trader joe 's in glen ellyn , il for just $ 5.99 a bottle , so i snatched up the last one . the bottle itself has a wire corked cap on it like a champagne bottle and the label is full of information about the beer and even how to pour it . pour this beer slowly or you will get a head that takes up 3/4 of the glass . even poured slowly you will get a dark ruby colored beer with a 3 finger foamy tan head that will hang around awhile and leave lots of nice lacing on the glass . the beer smells like you just opened a fresh roll of life savor hard candies . it 's really sweet smelling and very fruity . the taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell would suggest . instead , it 's full of dark fruit flavors like plums , figs , and red grapes , and then add to that a toffee-like sweetness . but we 're not quite done yet . the finish then offers up a spicy , alcoholic taste with just a lingering hint of brown sugar/molasses sweetness . it 's a very interesting , complex , and wine-like beer . this has a very smooth and silky mouthfeel to it . medium to full bodied with just a moderate amount of carbonation - very wine-like . i finished the entire bottle by myself , but the 8.5 % abv will definitely come back to kick you , so i would n't recommend any more than this at one sitting , but it 's a great sipping beer . many reviewers found even more flavors in it than i did , so drink it slowly and see how many different tastes and smells you can pick out .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 1.00	this one has been aged for at least a year , which may have changed the flavor ... i do n't know what it tastes like off the line , but i would recommend aging , because this is wonderful . a- slightly cloudy . deep , rich amber , like the kind they make dinosaurs out of . some strange black particles in the bottom ... ? s- hoppy , and malt too , that comes in to almost balance ... smells wonderful . t- okay . slightly metallic , but hoppy and the malt balances ... it 's really good , but simply not as good as the nose . m- somewhat thin , actually . smooth , clean , but a little more watery than i expected . d- i could drink this for hours . cheers .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	shared a bottle , had a small pour . reviewed from notes . a - a clear golden yellow pour with minimal side lacing , which i suppose is to be expected with such a low abv . a - getting some light wit notes throughout ( which makes sense seeing how this is a wild witbier ) . there are some nice sweet notes and some really good light citrus aromas as well ( mostly lemon ) . t - some nice tartness with this . more of those lemons along with some orange as well . theres that nice brett funky flavour too with more of those witbier flavors on the end . m - to be expected , this was super light and very crisp and dry . perfect carbonation and ridiculously easy to drink . o - super nice wild ale here . its an epic pain in the ass to get a bottle of , or atleast it appeared to be . very glad i got to try this . only knock is the appearance , which i guess one could cut slack for due to the abv . a must try if one has the chance .

0.80 0.80 0.90 0.60 0.50	a tasty treat courtesy of mymrrngjckt . cheers kevin ! appearance : poured from the bottle into my dfh glass , the beer is a very cloudy , light yellowy golden color with a huge mountain of thick , creamy looking , stark white head . i had to take my time pouring this one as i almost had me a couple of foamy overflows . as i sit here and wait for the foam to subside i have to admit that the retention on mount st. buff is impressive . smell : a spicy , flowery bitterness is immediately present . the rosemary and thyme stand out the most to me , i can pick up some of the parsley , too . a veritable potpourri of spices that is actually a bit too much and is almost overwhelming . taste : well , if the spicy smell is n't overwhelming , the taste certainly is . wow . it tastes like an epileptic had a seizure and dropped the entire kitchen spice cabinet into the wort . the flavors are n't bad , really , just taken a bit too far . mouthfeel : a nice light to medium body , clean crisp feel , and plenty of carbonation . drinkability : this one is tough . it 's a good beer , just a bit too heavy on the spices . i 'm glad i got a chance to try it as i love the beers that each of the three breweries make , but this one just goes overboard with a good thing . worth a try , certainly , but there 's no way i could have more than one of these in an evening .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.80 0.90	deep amber color and very nice clarity . light beige head is large bubbled and fades to a slick sheen quickly . nutty , toasty aroma . pretty basic marzen smell . clean and fresh sweet malts are the main attraction . quite a wide variety of malty flavors . sweet , toasty , nutty and to a lesser extent caramel flavors are all on display in this beer . moderate to highly carbonated and fairly light bodied compared to many american versions . has a mildly bitter finish , i think attributed to both the hop and toasty malt flavors . hops almost have a saaz feel to them . nice . overall , this is a fine tasting brew . smooth , crisp and refreshing . i could put a few litres of this away on a fine fall afternoon . one of my favorite oktoberfests i have had this year .

0.50 0.50 0.70 0.50 0.50	the basics : $ 7.49/500ml bottle ( yikes ! ! ) and 7 % abv ( nice ) ... very expensive ... pours a muddy amber , on the way to mahogany . no real head forms on pour . it kind of rims the glass about 30 seconds after pouring . very slight lacing , if any . not really any carbonation . sort of sub-par ... however ... . the aromas are super intriguing . i love this chocolately , woody thing going on . a very strange , almost musty smell in there , though , really draws me back ... i ca n't really place some of these aromas , and it worries me a tad . there is a very sweet component , too , like hot chocolate powder ... strange and unique , but interesting ... flavor is crazy , but has an almost astringent character to it . it 's like paint thinner , and that 's the smell i could n't place earlier . this is really unfortuante and ca n't be what the brewers intended , can it ? ? ! ! there is a cavalcade of other stuff going on , but the paint thinner residue is so thick i ca n't stop thinking about it . the finish is almost entirely this paint thinner note , with tons of bitterness ( hopefully from hops and not actual paint thinner ) ... this is , unfortunately , too `` off '' to recommend ... look elsewhere unless you like the bad side of strange in your brews ... what i like most : the oh so close to being good aroma profile . what i like least : the `` paint thinner '' characteristic that colors everything . verdict : if it 's a good beer , and not a mistake , this is weird ... too weird ...

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.80 0.90	pours coppery amber with a large lasting head . nose shows lots of tropical fruit : lychees , melon , paw-paw along with orange blossom . underneath is lovely cookie-dough and a little nutty malt that becomes more prominent later on . very nice ! flavours almost exactly mirror the flavours but the nutty malt really stands out now . carbonation is much too high . murray 's continue to impress me .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	picked this one up at beers of the world in the roc a few months ago . pulled it out of the cellar and put it in the fridge this afternoon . a- opaque black with a creamy tan head ; good lacing effect . retention not as impressive as most imperials , but a very nice looking ale here . s- fruit dominates the scent of this beer . cherries emerge to the forefront , blanketing the coffee and chocolate in the background . t- a phenomenal cherry-chocolate burst at first , following by a slightly burnt coffee . a bit too sweet for an imperial stout , however . m- smooth and creamy , carbonation is not abundant . excellent for it 's style . d- amazingly drinkable for a stout . if not for the abv , this would be a delicious session beer .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	poured a light straw yellow with a light white head and a tiny amount of lacing smelled pretty sour , with some peach and wheat aromas coming through mainly tasted sour off the first taste , slowly tasting of sour peaches and a nice wheat body on it . slightly watery , as most wheat beers seem to taste , but a great light beer . i think this could be very drinkable if it were not for the hefty price tag . nice and refreshing in the end .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	hazy appearance in my glass , but rather light in color for a dopplebock . color is dark amber with ruby tints . a finger-thick of creamy , eggshell-colored head sits atop , and while dissipating , leaves a nice lacing on the glass . lots of caramel on the nose , along with some fruit and honey ( cherries maybe ) . very malty nose . sipping reveals a very malty , caramel flavor with lots of honey coming through on the tip of my tongue . a bit of alcohol hits my tongue right at the end , but rather smooth body . dangerous feel . with the lack of alcohol coming through on the sip , it is a dangerous brew ! fairly smooth body with just a bit of carbonation hitting at the initial sipping then smoothing out the nice smooth malty body . very drinkable . a bit sweet overall for mass consumption , but i 'm gon na give it a shot to finish this growler ! ; )

0.60 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.90	rising moon , was a bit of a lighter beer , but with much flavors . the lime flavors stand out the most , and makes this beer very refreshing . it would be nice if it had a stronger flavor . rising moon had a nice apperance , nothing speical , not too far off from regular blue moon . the smell was not very strong , but deffently not foul rising moon had a nice refreshing taste , strong lime flavors .

0.60 0.60 0.70 0.50 0.40	( 25 cl bottle ) clear deep golden color with a white head . typical belgian strong ale scent . smells of alcohol and also very sweet . behind it all is a familiar smell of canned crushed tomatoes . very sweet taste , almost no bitterness . very full mouth feel . t aste is also very much like a belgian strong ale , with an after taste of boiled vegetables .

0.40 0.40 0.60 0.40 0.40	[ best served in an english pint ] poured amber in color with a slight haze to it . the aroma was that of caramel malts with a slight sent of fruit . ( could be orange ) . the mouhtfeel was light and lacked body . the taste was a little bitter with hints of fruit and sweetness . overall a basic beer .

0.70 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.70	poured out of a growler filled from a tap at the south shore mall location in braintree ma , this beer is murky brown in color , with almost no head at all ( the head probably fares better on tap ) . the smell is malty , carrying caramel , dark chocolate , and a little dried fruit . i can not detect a significant hop aroma . this beer is sweet and full-bodied , starting with a thick maltiness and quickly gaining a slightly-sour , fruity flavor . the finish is sticky , and leaves the sourness around to be mulled upon . there may be some hops in the finish . the carbonation is low - possibly due to some loss in the growler . it is easy to drink , and has a somewhat unusual character . i find it moderately tasty . perhaps with some more carbonation , and something more to balance the sweetness , this would be excellent .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	presentation : poured from an 11.2 oz brown bottle into a duvel tulip . label depicts a multi-colored parrot holding a glass of beer . `` i '' above bier is dotted with a heart . no clear freshness date . appearance : an appreciable `` crack '' upon popping the cap is soon followed by co2 coming out of solution and forcing beer out the lip of the bottle . pours with 5 fingers of almost pure white head ; enough that i have to stop pouring . when i finally get the beer into the glass , the remaining head is a moonscape of peaks and valleys , displaying incredible lacing . the beer itself is orange honey and very cloudy . a fair amount of sediment remains in the bottle , but i swirled the last pour a bit . smell : green apples , yeasty sourness , grassy hops and a wheat twang . taste : caramel and bready malt with a citrus tartness . sugary sweetness lingers long after the sip . tannic bitterness comes sneaking back long after the lingering sweetness fades . mouthfeel : average to slightly higher than average carbonation level . carbonation bite hits the back of the tongue and delivers the flavor while simultaneously cleanising the palate . body is amazing , thick and viscous , very mouth coating . drinkability : another hits from this brewery . i have seen these labels for many years and avoided them because i just did n't know a lot about the contents . in searching for more belgians , this one followed me home and i am glad it did .

0.80 0.90 0.70 1.00 0.90	poured into my trusty tulip . a half-inch white head shrinks to lacing on top of a light straw color . this smells fantastic . lots of tropical fruits and sweet fruit punch . this is the third time i have this beer and this is the best it 's smelled because this is the freshest it 's been . the taste is slightly sweet , and mimics the smell with a slight hint of citrus in the finish . this is one of the less astringent dipa 's i 've had , but the flavor is quite unique in it 's marriage of hops and malt . delicious ! carbonation is relatively light on this one . definitely wish i bought more , i could drink this all day !

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.60	a : poured a cloudy straw yellow color with lots of carbonation , perhaps to much s : herbs , hay , peppery , light funk and lemon t : light pepper , lemon with hay , horseblanket , some earthiness m : light bod , dry but this beer falls flat on its face with flavor about midway to end . o : average

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70	[ purchased at the anderson valley brewery last week so i 'm assuming it 's pretty fresh ... ] without a doubt a summer seasonal - this one was made for a front porch swing on a hot summer night . pour is mixed - an attractive light caramel brown body with a surprisingly thin head even with an aggressive pour . count to ten and there 's no head at all and no lacing . the nose is , uh , 'interesting ' and at least a fair warning of what 's to come . one whiff and there 's no doubt this will be a surpringly sweet drink . all i could think of is vanilla cream soda - especially since most good cream sodas are brown . the taste is as the smell promised : sweet . much too sweet , in my opinion . i could n't decide if ths was a cream soda flavored beer or a beer flavored cream soda . besides the vanilla there are small hints of nutmeg , a light roasted malt note and just a teeny tiny bit of hop finish to keep this from being completely cloying . some fruitiness similar to their boont amber - notes of apricot and plum compliment the overall theme . mouthfeel is certainly the highlight of this drink . i 'll have to reconsider what i describe as a 'light bodied ' beer because this one is much lighter than anything else i 've tried . not that being so light is a bad thing , in fact it 's almost magical that they can make something that 's mostly water but with only half the weight as it floats down your throat . still pretty sweet and it leaves a bit of syrupy coating on the tongue . surprisngly little carbonation ( as the lack of head suggested ) and yet still light on the palate . drinkable ? i suppose ... i can really see this being a good picnic beer , something to take to the beach with the hot dogs and chips . i had two non-beer drinkers in the room who normally find my ipas or strong ales much too aggressive and both pronounced this a 'very drinkable brew ' so it may be a good crossover beer for people unfamiliar with craft brews .

0.80 1.00 1.00 0.90 0.80	when cracking open this beer , i instantly put my nose to the opening , and thought to myself , `` wow . '' that 's all i could think about because of the huge coffee notes that come through along with hints of bitter dark chocolate and some malty bready flavours in the background . it also has a hint of sweetness , like lactose or something . the beer is black as pitch , with a centimeter brown/tan head that dissipate rather quickly . i wanted it to stay around longer because it looked so god damned beautiful . so remember how i said wow when i smelled it ? well , fuck , it 's just as much as a wow for the flavour . when i took a sip , there were loads and loads of flavours that jumped into my mouth , coffee , chocolate , oats , and roastiness . the flavour is absolutely stunning , it 's balance and complexity are through the roof ; at first there is a coffee flavour with a nice chocolate burst after , then after they started to linger off my tongue a slight oily slickness and oat flavour came through . there is also a nice bitterness that follows . the only downfall is that the coffee flavour is a bit to much in the front , but i 'm assuming it fades when it ages . the mouthfeel is fucking perfect : it 's thick and creamy . i could also drink quite a few of these because i just love the taste of coffee .

1.00 0.70 1.00 0.50 0.60	canned on january 11 , 2011 . a : black . an aggressive pour creates about a finger 's worth of dark brown head that lasts for a minute or two . the lacing is quite prominent for the style . this is what an imperial stout should look like . s : sweet miso , roast , dark fruit , and booze . i found the miso a bit too prominent . t : tamari , blackstrap molasses , some chocolate and roast . some dark fruit . and booze , of course , but not as prominent as i expected from the smell . i found the tamari and sweetness overwhelming and would have preferred more hop bitterness to balance the sweetness . m : smooth and creamy . it 's definitely thick , but it does n't feel anywhere near as syrupy as it looks . o : this beer has a great appearance and mouthfeel . the unbalanced sweetness and the tamari put me off . i occasionally pick up miso/tamari/soy sauce in roasty imperial stouts , but this was way too much . [ on a later occasion , i sniffed some actual soy sauce while drinking the beer , and that helped me break the soy sauce association somewhat . it did n't help me enjoy the beer any more , though . ]

0.70 0.80 1.00 1.00 0.80	a - black as a beer could be . a dark brown ring of a head . very little lacing . could be coffee if not for the ring of a head . s - whisky and vanilla , toasted malts . bittery sweetness and a wee bit of alcohol . t - starts with a sharp and fast kick of bourbon flavor and a weak alcohol burn , then creamy chocolatey malts quickly come in with some vanilla . very creamy for a little bit then the bourbon flavor comes back . finish leaves a lasting smoky malty flavor with faint afterthoughts of the bourbon-y onslaught . m - thick and creamy with a good level of carbonation , alcohol is `` felt '' at some times . d - this is the bourbon aged stout and should be experienced by all . good night !

0.90 0.90 0.60 0.90 0.80	pours from the bomber a dark rusty amber with a good deal of haze , excellent color . forms a nice 3 inch cap of head , off white with decent retention and a generous amount of spotty lacing . nose is pretty great , golden raisins with a caramel backing and piney hops coupled with some dark citrus and pineapple . a bit strong with the alcohol even as this bottle has been left to sit for a while . brown sugar and toffee maltiness with a slight toasted feel that gives it a touch of nuttiness . transitions from dark fruit notes into a citrus and pine hop backing . hops provide a pleasant bitterness that tones down some of the syrupy sweetness in the malts . finishes bitter with a lingering hint of grapefruit rind . full bodied and adequately carbonated . while finishing dry it 's very boozy and syrupy at the same time , the flavors complement this effect well but it still does n't sit right , alcohol should be able to be hidden better as there 's more than enough malt to do this . a slow sipper with lots of complex character that runs deep . sawtooth is a light esb so i really was expecting something similar , chainsaw is more of a hybrid between a belgian dark and an esb with extra alcohol kicked in . if there was oak and vanilla in this it would be a clone of odell 's woodcut no . 3 and i mean that in the nicest way .

0.20 0.50 0.60 0.40 0.30	this beer makes me kind of nervous . poured from a bottle without a freshness date ( might explain some of what is to come ) into a pint glass . appearance was grim . cloudy , deep amber , with lots of particulate matter suspended in the beer . i can see several dark specks of something hanging in the glass -- definitely not yeast particles -- and i am somewhat grossed out . looks like some foreign matter got into this and whatever it is is a little too large to make me feel warm and fuzzy about viking 's quality assurance process . smell was inferior . this beer does n't smell hoppy , and it sure does n't smell like one of the ipas i consider the state of the art . this beer does not taste good . there 's an off flavor -- sort of a combination of circus peanuts and soap that is pretty off-putting . i do n't know what happened to this batch , but something went wrong . mouthfeel is about average for an ipa . hard to separate from the taste , but i do n't notice anything above or below average . again , i am somewhat nervous about finishing this beer . on the basis of the foreign matter in the brew , i have to rate drinkability very low . i have not had very much success with viking beers , but this specimen is really exceptionally poor . i will give the brewer the benefit of the doubt that something bad happened to this particular batch , but even so , that 's not a good omen for future sampling .

0.50 0.60 0.30 0.60 0.50	stopper brought this bottle over and neither of us expected much but who knows . we are pouring a cold bottle into pint glasses . the beer pours a birght clear gold color with bleached white fizzy head of .5 cm that fades quickly . aroma is grainy malts , slightly skunky/funky , some spicy hops as well . a bit of sugaryness as well . first sip reveals a lite body and very sharp prickly carbonation . flavor starts sweet with some corn sugar and a hint of caramel again some spicy hops are present and a bit of husky malt and some corn/vegetable notes as well . on the finish there is a hit of citrusy/rind hops . the beer is clean and sweet , not great or exciting but certainly not a drain pour either .

0.70 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint . pours a very deep black with some red tinges . head is a mocha color , one finger high and disappates fairly quickly . lacing is about average . my nose is a little stuffed while reviewing this , so the smell part is a little hard to do . i mostly smell roasted malts , chocolate and coffee , which are sure to be the dominant smells . the coffee , of what i can get of it , smells great . subtle nuances are lost on me right now . this is a really good tasting porter . the roasted malts take center stage , backed up by the bitter coffee and chocolate flavors . the coffee is very realistic and very well done . this is one of the very rare 5.0s i 'll give to mouthfeel . it 's just smooth and thick enough to feel perfect going down . the lack of a bitter aftertaste also helps make this a very drinkable porter . usually when i buy a single of a beer , that 'll wet my appitite for more . but not in this case . i want more pipeline porter , and i plan on getting a ton more while it 's still around . it 's perfect for the winters here in florida , where it does n't get too cold , but i still get the craving for something a bit heavier .

0.50 0.40 0.40 0.50 0.80	being that i had heard about the tastiness of the carolina blondes before i moved here ( and i was sincerely hoping these were sorority girls in chapel hill ) , i figured i should try the beer pre-move to the state . so , while visiting my in-laws , i picked up a sixer and took it home to sample . the beer poured out a light golden color with minimal white head . no lacing was found on the inside of my glass as i drank it . the scent was alright , nothing to get excited about . it smelled faintly sweet with a mixture of malt and honey . it tasted just about the same , with a light mouthfeel and the sweetness consistent through the drink . a slightly bitter aftertaste with a touch of a metallic aftertaste . allowing it to warm did n't do much for it or me . it seemed to grow more bland the closer to room temperature it became . overall , an alright beer to drink a lot of but not one to sit down and truly enjoy .

0.70 0.90 0.40 0.50 0.50	poured a beautiful deep amber with a foaming , floating head . smelled excellent , almot identical to ( the amazing ) hop rod rye . this is where it all goes down hill . taste is bitter , astringent , and otherwise fairly bland . i would n't call this beer hoppy in anyway as none of the typical spice taste is present . its just disappointingly bitter . maybe this is what organic beers taste like ( this is my first ) and if so , i wo n't be trying another .

0.70 0.40 0.60 0.30 0.30	my saga to lower my average score continues . tallboy poured into a pilsner glass ( this is a pilsner , right ? ) . 3.5 a : compared to the bud light i recently had , this looks like a stout . noncomparatively , this is pale yellow and super clear . nearly three fingers of frothy white head with average retention and a decent amount of lacing . 2.0 s : dry , dusty graininess with nothing else going on . maybe some rice . 1.0 t : this is truly fucking awful . i ca n't remember the last time i had this beer ( it might have been while i was under age ) , but i never thought it would be so awful . it 's paradoxically tasteless and sickeningly sweet in a rice sort of way . 3.0 m : i ca n't complain a whole lot about the mouthfeel . it 's crisp and light and not ridiculously overcarbonated like most of these types of beers . 1.5 d : the only reason this gets a 1.5 instead of a 1.0 is because the mouthfeel is n't horrible . i ca n't believe this is this bad though .

0.60 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	appearance a cloudy gold color . it has average head retention . smell it does have a malty smell and has a uniquely average aroma . taste it is bitter as the maker intended . also malty and filled with hops . but unfortunately , i just did n't like it that much . mouthfeel the carbonation and coarseness of this pilsner is the only bright spot to this beer . drinkability not a bad beer at all , but just not my thing .

0.60 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.70	a : pours a cloudy light golden color ; small head , very little lacing s : sweet malts with some slight floral hops t : very very sweet malts dominate the flavor with a little bit of hop bitterness and boozy sharpness at the end . m : medium thickness , a little bit sharp on the tongue o : this is the second time i 've tried this beer , and both times ( 2 year old batch and 6 month old batch ) have had almost no hop presence whatsoever . if this is what they consider their holy grail for hopheads , then they have seriously failed . it says it ages well , but i would n't recommend drinking one past 4 months old unless you wan na drink straight malt syrup , which is what it tasted like to me both times . very disappointing , as i was expecting a ridiculously hoppy brew to satiate my hop withdrawals , but this has failed to deliver both as a fresh bottle and as an aged one .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.80	pours with just a faint wisp of deep tan head , reasonable lacing and retention considering the soft carbonation . big roast coffee notes and tobacco with hint of dark chocolate and underlying plum . on the palate this has a bit of a rough , bitter finish , but a velvety texture that highlights some mid-palate sweetness ( that lingers unexpectedly ) . coffee rules the day , though . the texture on this is sublime , but it stays around fairly sweet , and until it nears room temperature there 's a bit of a ragged edge on the finish . very close to being great , this will have to settled for damned good .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70	12oz bottle served in a shaker pint . ( best by stamp smudged and illegible ; others in the mixed pack read 03/15/11 , so that 's be my guesstimate . ) pours a dark brown/mahogany tone with a half inch khaki-colored head . dissipates pretty hastily into a thin cap/collar around the glass ; decent lacing . nose carries a decent bouquet of chocolate , roasted malts , and coffee . flavor follows the aroma . some bitterness to it , especially in the finish . sort of a metallic note in the background . moderately tasty ... not blowing my hair back but it 's good . mouthfeel is the worst aspect of this beer imo . on the thin and watery side . somewhat chalky . ok drinkability .

0.90 0.50 0.20 0.20 0.20	this beer has a rating . for this reason , i bought 6 bottles . guess what i hate this beer very much . although it looks very good with golden color , it smell and taste horrible . maybe it is just me , but i do n't like this kinda of beer . a . good looking . s. it has rather special smelling , not a normal beer kinda of smell . personally , i do n't like this smell . t. horrible . this beer is too hard to drink . it left very bitter taste afterward . i ca n't taste any sweetness from this better . it has some strange taste first , then the rest is bitterness . seriously , i ca n't finish a whole bottle . m. feel like drinking water , but it taste strange . some people like this beer because of this , but not me . o . do n't consider this beer if you are new to beer drinking . it is very hard to drink and tastes horrible .

0.20 0.30 0.30 0.60 1.00	reviewed late new year 's eve/early new year 's day . transcribed exactly as written on my bar reciept from earlier that night . a -- remarkably clear with a sight yellow hugh . fizzy white fizzy head with mostly little bubbles . s -- bready , yeasty , crappy i dont like it t -- sour . bland . watery . clean finish . makes me want mongolian chicke m -- watery with little fizzy bubbles d -- as drinkable as water

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	a - this beer poured a black color that produced a foamy tan head that had good retention and did a deceent job of lacing the glass s - the only scent that i could detect was the belgian yeast t - the taste of this beer was very interesting , and the stout characteristics were present , bitter chocolate , smoke on the finish , but also an added yeast funk that was n't exactly my favorite , but it worked nice and was something different m - the mouthfeel of this beer was a bit a downer , thin to medium body , but way to thin for a stout , and a moderate amount of carbonation d - this was a very unique beer , not everything that i imagined in a stout , but something new that was quite refreshing

0.50 0.50 0.80 0.70 0.70	cloudy , glowing orange-yellow body loaded with a lot of suspended particulate matter . minimalist head . aroma is very weak , with faint notes of lemon and honey . however , the flavor is quite unique . fruity gummy worms and grapefruit flavored cough drops are followed by bitter green tea notes . the flavor is all up front . it dissipates rather quickly after you sample it , and then you forget what the beer tasted like until you take another sip and are immediately hit with that familiar , fruity blast of candy , citrus , and bitter green tea . smooth in the beginning with more bitterness and alcohol burn surfacing on the finish . could be a lot better ( especially for the price ) but it 's by no means horrible . there 's something here for sure , but it 's far from being perfected . i certainly would n't call this a double ipa though . if you 're expecting that style here , you will be severely let down .

0.60 0.90 0.50 0.70 0.80	robust , eh ? i doubt it . black in color with a thin spotty head . the aroma is probably the strong point of this beer -- a nice roasty , coffee-like scent , with a mild chocolatey undertone . the flavor profile is fairly similar , though the relatively high carbonation level distracts from some of the flavor . starts off with a sweet , mocha-like malt flavor , which develops into a gently roasty finish . as with the aroma , there 's a slight chocolatey undercurrent which really helps this beer out . still , it seems a bit thin -- medium to medium-light body . finish is slightly dry with a very mildly acidic hop bite . drinkable alright , but not terrific .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.50	appearance : light amber , copper . burnt umber . light white head disappeared quickly . aroma : bourbony aroma . roasted caramel sweetness . the main smells seem smoky and fairly sweet . hints of vanilla and spicing are dulled and muted by the upfront aromas . taste : thick , syrupy laced with vanilla . hints of sweet cherry and almond . very very sweet . full thick cough syrupy mouthfeel . the flavors here are n't that bad . but the thickness of the mouthfeel just are n't quite what i expected from a big beer from avery . notes : like i said , the flavors and aromas here do n't seem off , but the beer it too syrupy in mouthfeel . where did all the sugar come from if this finished at 14 % ? i do n't believe i 'll be buying this one again .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.70	overall , this is a good stout with only a few blemishes . it pours a dark brown with just a bit of light coming through on the edges . a beautiful , thick head formed and lazily faded away until a small layer stuck round the edges . the smell is a malty chocolate smell with some anis mixed in . like most stouts , it is thick and a bit dry . it was n't as smooth as i expected because of a slight chalky feel in the mouth . but the taste was great for a stout , classic at that . malty with the hint of licorice and kept me pouring it down despite that downgrade with the chalkiness . another good pickup from north coast . found in the cost plus 2004/05 winter brews pack .

0.40 0.40 0.80 0.60 0.50	i 've tried the 312 a couple of previous times but have recently started reviewing . poured a cloudy straw color finger width of straight white head . some lacing as it dissapated . still learning as far as describing aromas and flavors but regardless i 'm just not impressed . huge fan of goose island and a fan of quite a few american wheat ales but this just is n't doing it for me .

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.80 0.80	picked up a few bottles from the brewery to give this new offering a spin . amsterdam seem to be a bit more successful when they make forays away from lagers , so we 'll see ... comes in a clear glass bottle with no indication of the contents . its cheap and probably also contravenes ontario packaging regulations . pours such a dark brown you 'd swear it was black . immediately a bubbly tan head jumps up and lasts for a few minutes before settling to a collar and depositing the odd streak of lace on the way down . the aroma is full of roast , but mostly coffee and bitter chocolate . there 's perhaps a touch of earthiness to it as well . the flavour is impressive . both the coffee and the chocolate come through strong , and there 's a fairly assertive bitterness that lingers on after the sip . the earthiness is there , but its definitely the roast that dominates . unfortunately the body is a little off , but not enough to ruin the beer . its a touch too light and the carbonation is a little higher than it should be , which lends the feeling of a soda . this is a pretty good effort , and better than their regular lineup . if the body was bulked up and the carbonation toned down i think this would be a winner , but at this point i ca n't overlook that issue and it will prevent me from buying any further bottles .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	appearance - golden with a 1 inch white fluffy head that has good retention . smell - floral , minor biscuit , pale malt , simple and not well put together taste - thankfully not like the nose , the floral is much more smooth and no herbal kick to it like the nose . pale malt , a big of grass , and some honey . mouthfeel - wonderful body with great carbonation and just beautifully drinkable . well done here .

0.40 0.40 0.70 0.50 0.50	a- hazy amber with very thin head that quick dissipates to nothing . no lacing left . s- smells grassy . t- sweetness . do n't know the abv of this one but it seems you can taste the alcohol presence , although i doubt its very high . somewhat sour ending . m- carbonation is n't bad , somewhat watery . d- i 'd have to pass on this if it were ever offered to me again . it was n't terrible but nothing stood out as great or even good .

0.70 0.50 0.60 0.20 0.20	got this in a `` pandora 's box '' mixed pack . 12 oz bottle poured into a pint mug . nice fluffy head , pretty golden bronze color , light fruit smell , and then the drink ... apricots . apricots . apricots . sweet , sour , bitter . hops undetectable above the jaw-clenching , eye-squinching , head-shaking sourness . awful . ugh . otherwise , it defintely seems to be beer , ( if in no way resembling any version of a contemporary pa ) , but with a sour and bitter fruitiness that pervades , annoys , and overwhelms . the originally enticing head cashed in early and diminished to virtual non-existence before i gave up trying to like this one ; very little lacing to wash out of the glass . wo n't drink the other two in the sampler , did n't finish this one , and opened a sn celebration ale to get the taste out of my mouth . cheers !

0.60 0.90 0.50 0.80 0.80	pours ruby with a small fizzy head that dies away fairly quickly . not bad , but not impressive . well , it smells like a russian imperial , at least . raisins , alcohol , roasted malt , dark chocolate , red wine . very nice . tastes much like it smells . sweet and dry red wine , burnt dark malt , juicy red fruit and an earthen , dry finish with a lingering stickycitrus hop that 's more than a little uncommon , for the style . flavor is taken down a notch by a weak body , but this is more than drinkable . a good but uneven ris . maybe it could some aging ... i dunno .

0.80 0.70 0.60 0.90 0.70	poured into a ommagang dokel light strawberry red with a very light flim over the hop , very nice color suble dry cherry smells with some slight alcohol notes and just a hint of sweetness very dry cherry flavor at first with a bitter dry wine like middle . cherry flavors are very dominate in both these areas . i think the biggest suprise is the hops and the fruit flavor that comes in the finish very good finishing beer . mouthfeel is pretty thin and wine like tbh the beer has more wine qualities than beer , carbonation is also a bit high . easy to drink if you are in the mood for it but i cant see as i would drink it very often although for the style i have to say its one of my favorites in my limited exp .

0.60 0.60 0.30 0.60 0.60	poured from the bottle to a pint glass at 55 f. nice tan head which dissipated almost immediately . appropriately carbonated for a porter aroma : faint popcorn ball-like aroma . i really expected more scent from a caramel flavored beer . after tasting , i noticed how artificial the flavor was and hence why there is very little aroma . taste : nothing on the front , slight caramel in the middle , and mildly bitter finish . mouthfeel : i am also going to attribute the somewhat wax like mouthfeel to this artificial flavoring as well . drinkability : rather doscile for a porter . a craft brew porter should have more flavor .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	a - a golden and cloudy poor ... initial foam quickly settles combined with minimal carbonation ... once settled it reminds me of a glass of apple juice ... s - raspberry smell is obvious though it seems artificial and not authentic ... displays some cider qualities as well ... t - slightly tart raspberry taste ... not complex ... taste is much more natural than the artificial sent ... m - very dry ... light ... d - goes down easy , but not memorable ... a one and done type brew ... very few characteristics of a good hefeweizen are present ...

0.70 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.70	as an introduction , i was tremendously excited to try midas touch from the first time i heard about it ; i was n't let down . pours a slightly hazy , light gold , similar to a belgian pale . aroma is reminiscent of white wine , very strong grape character with plenty of alcohol and a mildly peppery spice . tastes at first of bushels of sweet malt , with a quick detour into boozy spice before resolving into grape and honey sweetness , and a warming finish . mouthfeel is outstanding , slick and effervescent . between the complexity and the abv , it 's hard to drink more than a couple , but the first one or two are very good .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	had on draft at a local irish pub in the old port . dark dark amber colot cant see thru at all thick white head remains on the glass and laces well the smell is of roasted and caremel malts , like a traditional english ale slightly different then my expectation of an alt but i like the smells tastes like a homebrew very fresh and smooth with crystal and roasted malts through out . to finish not a lot of body or carbonation leaves a dry roasted flavor

0.80 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.70	pours a deep amber color with a whispy tan head that retains ok , a little darker than a lot of marzens out there . the aroma has tons of caramelized malt notes upfront , along with some toasted bread , brown sugar , toffee , honey , pretzel , musk and earthy hops . flavor has some pumpernickel bread character initially , along with pretzel , toffee , brown sugar , earthy hops , a little musk and some alcohol . the carbonation on this one is way too high which really detracts from the mouthfeel and drinkability . a decent stab at a marzen but not one of the better examples

0.90 0.40 1.00 0.80 0.80	22oz bottle a- a dark brown that allows alittle light through it . the head is small but retains for a while . s- probably the most disappointing part of this beer , the smell is so faint that i ca n't pick out any specific notes . t- it taste lightly of hops then has a good hop finish a very clean taste . m- i think it 's very drinkable and it could easily be a session beer at 1.99 each

0.70 1.00 0.80 0.50 0.60	poured from a bottle into a pint glass . the appearance of this beer rocks . the pour is great with three fingers of foam . the head stays for a little bit then disappears after twenty seconds or so , perfect timing in my opinion . it gives you enough time to appreciate the appearance and smell the beer properly before tilting it back . it 's a nice orange reddish color with a little bit of bubbling action . schlafly 's pumpkin ale may have the best smell of any pumpkin beer i 've ever had . all of the spices are intense , the cinnamon , nutmeg and clove work in a perplexingly good culmination of flavors and scents . i walked around my house and put the beer under my roommate 's noses and then slow on the cue i 'd exclaim , `` smell . '' ( as if they had a choice then . ) i 'm beginning a new thing of wanting the scent of beers made into candles , this is one such beer . but then comes the taste . i 'm torn on this one like i 'm michael bay 's plot structure . instead of the dichotomy of racism and explosions ( bay ) , it 's my love for pumpkin beer and this beer too much of a pumpkin . the taste hits your senses in the face like it 's chris brown . my immediate reaction was , 'whoa i love this beer ' and then i thought , 'ow . ' it 's just too much at once . i love pumpkin beers , but there 's just too much spice action in this one - so much so that it kills my enjoyment of the beer . i cringe every time i take a drink ; it 's just so sweet . i 'll drink my 6pack and enjoy it well enough , but i do n't think i 'll buy another .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.60	beware the singles bin : i noticed after purchasing a bb date of 05/31/06 . regardless , this beer held up in most respects . hazy , dark honey / amber colour with one finger off-white head that left a ring and wispy surface featuring several large bubbles sitting still atop the brew . some sheet lace . smell was sweet with honey dew and vanilla wafer , a bit spicy , overall very pleasant aroma . taste was tart and a bit sour , dark fruit , roasted malt , increasing oak with air . texture was syrupy and a bit too boozy . still , the style was recognizable as a bock and still quite quaffable , a bit too much alcohol but not bad . interesting , to say the least .

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	a : beautiful , dark , reddish brown color . nearly no head and no visible signs of carbonation within the beer . s : super hoppy , partnered with an amber musk . the malts are more in the background and heavier in smell . interesting . smells more alcoholic than it is . even further in the background is a white cakey smell . t : chocolately , with a dull menthol or eucalyptus bitterness . not the heaviest taste . the amberness comes in the middle , with a near perfect balance of sweet and bitter . slightly syrupy . m : a great , great medium body , that grazes you at the tail with sharp carbonation . d : very easy , somewhat interesting , quite pleasant .

0.90 0.50 0.80 0.60 0.50	a - beautiful copper cloudiness s - definitely some distinct hops . unlike many other ipa 's i 've smelled . t - sweet towards the end . did n't really dig this that much . m - good . a little sticky . all in all , not one of my favorite ipa 's , but drinkable , for sure .

0.70 0.50 0.40 0.40 0.70	i 've never had a beer so similar to coca-cola . it looks like many bocks , but has very little flavor and aroma . coke is just as thin and only a bit sweeter . the hops are almost indetectable and i 'm really curious how this dark color exists without much maltiness in the beer . i 'm struggling to adequately review this beer because my taste buds are struggling find some flavor . it 's very smooth for 7.5 % abv , perhaps that 's caused by all the sugars instead of the herbal , hoppy aroma and breadiness from the malt i desired . however , this is the only bock i might consider a panty dropper .

0.90 0.90 0.70 1.00 0.90	well i finally got around to trying this , and i 'm sure glad i did ! pours out a hazy dark copper red , with a very bubbly thin head , that recedes to nothing . looked very inviting , looked very good ! smell was great , no off smells what so ever , the hops came through , and you could smell some of the sweetness , i cant put my finger on it exactly , but it defiantly smelt great ! hands down , this was one tasty beer ! it goes down real smooth , finishes with mild hop bitterness , and then you feel a warming sensation from the alcohol . very interesting and very well done . i enjoyed this one immensely ! the only downfall i saw with this beer was , the mouthfeel . it felt very thin , and tad over carbonated , with the same sensation as pop would leave in your mouth . not too bad , but at the same time i was very disappointed . i could honestly drink more than a few bombers of this beer , it is of high quality , and well balanced , it went down easy , and the higher abv was a nice added bonus . overall this was worth the money i spent , i have to defiantly try the other chimay variants . overall this is a very interesting beer , and i highly enjoyed this ! world class .

0.70 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.60	i thought i would try this beer out . it is horrible and i regret wasting money on this beer . the beer should not be imported into australia and should stay in nz where it belongs.a premium price for such a poor beer . its not the worst beer i have had , but its close ...

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.70	poured from a 12oz . bottle into a sam adams perfect pint . a : standard pour yields a .5 finger foamy white head with poor retention . collapses quickly into a thin film atop a slightly cloudy pale orange brew . lacing is spotty with moderate stick . average . clarity could use a bit of work but everything else is on point . s : nose is subtle . grass , pine cones , and tea leaves characterize the hop profile with a bit of cane sugar sweetness in the back . pretty pedestrian . t : opens with a slightly grassy and piney hop bitterness . tea leaves . some citrus and cane sugar in the middle that stays constant , finally dissipating towards the end . finish is a nice hop spiciness . aftertaste is a mild , sticky , resiny hop bitterness . very simple and easy drinking . m : light bodied and well carbonated . lively and bubbly in the mouth and watery and prickly going down . finish is slightly dry with a sticky , slightly lingering aftertaste . really drinkable and refreshing . o : the perfect summer day-drink for hours beer . refreshing , light , simple , and crisp . flavor could use a bit more character but overall , this is a solid example of its style .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.70 0.60	this is a very weird beer . it has a pours a cloudy grey color . smells like sourdough bread . tastes like nothing i can put my finger on at the moment . the mouth is thick and malty . as far as drinkability , i have to say that i would be really happy to have one of these if i was alive 4000 years ago but for now i 'm going to have to go for something else .

0.60 0.70 0.90 0.80 0.80	a : pours a murky dark mahogany-red color ; fat two finger-width head , fades quickly ; slight retention ; slick head , with barely any lacing . s : earthy notes with some wood , spice , and belgian yeast . t : starts out with a sweet light yeasty flavor ; the carbonation opens the flavor up almost immediately to reveal subtle earthy flavors with notes of belgian yeast , some tartness , and a hint of spice ; finishes dry with a slightly metallic lingering yeastiness ; no hint of booze at all -- where are they hiding the 9 % abv ? m : fairly thick and chewy despite the strong carbonation that tickles the tongue nicely as it opens up the flavors . phenomenal mouthfeel . o : this is a great beer -- not exceptional -- but great . i would love to buy it again except that it costs $ 6.99 for a 33cl bottle , too much in my opinion . if you love belgian dubbels or belgian strong dark ales , then you 'll love this .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	appearance this bier poured a light , shiny brown in color with a modest head . smell the smoke here was light and more like a slow-roasted pig than a heavy-handed rauchbier ashtray like some authentic examples of the style . taste the malts are surprisingly thick at the taste . it was big and heavy on the tongue . it was also super-sugary with lots of sweets to go with the modest smoked-bacon flavor . mouthfeel this one is in between light and medium-bodied with some modest carbonation . drinkability this rauchbier is very smooth and went down well . i threw some salami in my glass to make it interesting and it held up quite well . good job midnight sun ! comments vielen dank to my freudin kim for popping this gem at the first annual ballard bavarian bratwurst fest . it was a mighty tasty treat : )

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	a : pours a hazy amber with gold highlights . has a thin head that dissipates quickly and very low carbonation . n : sugary caramel , orange and notes of lemon . t : valencia orange , pine and floral notes . a small amount of grains float in the background along with hints of caramel and corn . m : light-medium bodied , creamy , smooth and crisp . o : quite refreshing and easy drinking . well balanced yet leans slightly toward the bitter side . this would make a great gateway beer .

0.60 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.50	another single from albertson 's in huntington beach . i think this may actually be the first black & tan i have ever had . i think that may be due in part to the fact that a black and tan should never be bottled . this beer is a testament to the reasoning behind that rule . i always thought a black and tan served in a bar would allow the 2 different beers to separate like oil and water . this , on the other hand , was a copper-colored beer with a thin white head . the aroma is of burnt wood . the flavor has none of the good characterisitics of either stouts or bocks . this river needs to stay hidden for crying out loud .

0.60 0.70 0.70 0.40 0.40	poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass . appearance : pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a finger of white head . the head fades quickly to a ring around the edge of the glass . smell : light malt and a slight tartness . smells good , but here is where i started to worry about how much flavor was going to be in this one . taste : this beer has a very light flavor . it might be good with the amount of the flavor , but there needs to be a lot more tartness . this is a pretty boring beer . mouthfeel : light body with sharp carbonation and a slightly dry finish . overall : i 've been into some berliner weissbiers of late and have had a few good ones . this is not one of them . too plain , i would n't have another .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	second brown ale of the evening , and the last one was a tough act to follow . poured into a pint glass . nice two fingers of fluffy head , good retention and some lacing . brown with ruby highlights in the light . smells sweet , chocolate and banana , some nuts , specifically walnuts . pretty good so far . up front , strong walnuts , followed by sweet malt and light caramel . fairly mild . slightly bitter , lightly roasted malt finish that 's more like a porter than a brown ale , but it 's not overwhelming and works well with this beer . a watery texture and lighter body than i expected from the nose , with a moderate amount of carbonation . more 'summer-appropriate ' than most brown ales . definitely a decent beer , laid back and reasonably complex without trying to be too bold . not quite as good as the rogue 's hazelnut brown , but it has its own unique qualities that would cause me to choose this one over the rogue or the more aggressive browns .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.60 0.80	i poured this stout from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass . it is dark , dark brown with an appealing chocolate milk-coloured head that was fairly thin , but nice while it lasted . the smell is like tia maria and milk - a mixture of sweetness , coffee , alcohol and dairy . the taste contrasts somewhat with the smell . not as much sweetness as i was expecting . toasted grains and lots of hops are present . i get dark chocolate and malt , but not much else . it finishes with a nice bitterness , but there is some sourness as well . mouthfeel is not that great with a `` watered down with club soda '' characteristic . the lower alcohol content and lack of robustness makes for easy drinkability .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.70 0.60	750ml brown glass cork & cage bottle . purchased at the brewery pub a few weeks back . no date . beautiful appearance ! lots of thick cascading tan/khaki head that stands up thick and soft as meringue . deep dark solid brown , slightly hazy . nose is full of brown caramelized sugar and old brown shoe leather . no roasted notes as with most brown ales . varnished wood and some citrus-y notes from the hops . palate is slightly bitter and some lightly roasted notes come through . hops play a supporting ( bittering ) role , not so much for flavor . there 's something of an infection in here too . some light acidity is creeping through . not sure if it 's brett or what but there 's something going to work in here . flavors are more forth-coming as it warms and there 's this wonderful leather note in there . notes : the roasted quality is very light but the beer is not soft or flabby . a well-made brown for sure , just bummed by the mild-infection , which will affect my mouthfeel scoring .

0.40 0.30 0.20 0.40 0.30	pours out a brassy gold with a thin ring of bubbles up top and a lot of carbonation in the body . smells like alcohol , grains , and cooked vegetables . this does have a sickening alcohol , sweetness , corn , and grain quality to it , but there is a bit of malt that shines through at the end , so i give it kudos on that note . mouthfeel is syrupy , slick , and prickly with bubbles . just sticks to my tongue . i hate this , and i will never buy this again . high gravity malt liquor is easier going down . wtf , miller ?

1.00 0.80 0.70 0.90 0.90	750ml bottle cellared for almost a full year in the basement . i first tried this with sushi and it paired well . upon popping the cap , a rush of bubbles rise to the surface and create an oozing , constant snake of foam out the top of the bottle . even after two generous pours into the glass , the carbonation from the yeast still finds a way to climb through the neck and show off . appearance- pours a deep , rusty copper with some chill haze ... the head is fantastic and rises to a soapy , resilient three fingers . outstanding structure ... the head even displays a light pinkish hue as it creeps and settles downward . wickedly beautiful lacing that completely coats the inside of the glass . parfait-like . exceptional . smell- musty , sour cherries and a little funk that reminds me of a true lambic aroma ... i love this particular quality in an artisanal brew . the rich , layered textures of barrel aging are definitely evident in the nose . taste- unique ... it 's better than i even expected for a biere-de-garde . the emphasis on the wild character is huge , with a big fermented fruit profile that puckers the mouth without the excessive acidity . the initial sour bite defers to a nice , earthy hop character ... then the whole tongue is involved and with it comes a rustic sweetness from the open fermentation . the aftertaste shows some barrel influence , with just a hint of alcohol bite and woody notes . fun for the whole family . mouthfeel/drinkability- the prickly carbonation pushes the limits of pleasing , as i can almost pinpoint every miniscule bubble ... however this does not kill the experience . as the tasting proceeds and the beer comes to temperature , it becomes smoother and richer . i 've just brought a wedge of chimay met biere trappist cheese to the table and now we 're partying . this beer really has it all ... the fruit , the funk , the belgian style artisanal elements that excite the palate . deliciously rewarding .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.60	( rgng 2002 ) pours out dark ruby brown with a thick creamy inch-tall beige head . the aroma is quite lifeless and dull . can pick up lifeless notes cocoa powder , dust and roasted malt . finf flavour way to sweet and one-dimensional . sticky sweet notes of light chocoalte , roasted grains , cocoa and brown sugar . empty , chalky mouthfeel , not much going on here . this classic has really gone downhill since i tried it a couple years ago .

0.70 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	i got this ontap at flip and baley 's in rosemont , pa . it came in a pint glass . appearance : the body is a cloudy gold color . the head is a white , fluffy two fingers tall , good retention and lacing , small bubbles . smell : the aromas are wheat , sparge and pepper . taste : the flavors are wheat , sparge , orange and hot spicy . mouthfeel : the mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp . drinkability : this is highly drinkable . do n't drink and review .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	it 's a black colored beer with ruby edges . fairly nice nose , with a variety of dark fruits , as well as a bit of chocolate and coffee . really nice nose . flavor is fully packed , loaded with dark fruits ( blackberry , plum , cherry and currant ) , as well as some notes of dark chocolate , coffee and a light hint of alcohol . i like it .

0.60 0.60 0.80 0.50 0.60	a small white head fades quickly over a translucent light straw golden . aroma is pils all the way : grassy for the most part , but a bit of spice is there . flavors are similar with fresh grains , grass , and that mild space . pretty mellow on the flavors and the mouthfeel is thin . but the beer is crispy and refreshing , without a doubt .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.50	a- dark brown/black with a brown airy head that levels down but still lingers a bit s- caramel and coffee malts t- same as nose , caramel and coffee malts carry through the end with a bit of bitter hops at the finish . not much depth at all m- lacking for a stout -- - no creaminess and it 's pretty thin overall d- wo n't seek this out again and i hope the rest of the breweries selections are better -- - really loses you in the mouthfeel

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70	i may not be 100 % sure , but is this the charleston pale ale that carolina beer & beverage has brewed for some time now ? if not , why would they have another american pale ale . pretty simple stylistically but good nonetheless . nice hop aroma and taste , nothing too exciting , but a great value at $ 2.50 a bottle here .

0.90 0.60 0.90 0.60 0.70	presentation : 750ml corked and caged brown bottle with a cool , trippy label . best before 3/2010 clearly notched . appearance : slightly hazy dark mahogany beer with a big , thick whipped light-tan cap . nice sheet lacing and good retention from this one . smell : big dried apple and oaky cider notes . there 's some sweet caramel in here , as well as a little dark fruit and booze as well . overall , this is a bit too cidery and fruity for me ; i 'm not sure if it was supposed to be like that , but there could definitely be some more malt in here . taste : tart spiced apples . there 's not a brett/lactic sour presence here , but there 's definitely a hit of fruity acidity . this is surprisingly dry as well . finishes with a bit of baking spice . again , i 'd like to see some more malt character here . mouthfeel : creamy , and lusciously soft drinkability : medium ... splitting this with the wife was even a bit more than i wanted conclusion : this is pretty interesting , kind of like a spiced version of pommeau de normandie ( a norman apple cider/calvados mix ) . it 's esoteric , funky , but a bit over the top for me , a little bit too brash , boozy , and spicy ( especially considering the brewery does n't use spices in this beer ) for me .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.90	best artwork of all the flying dog art . hats off to ronald daul . pours a very dark black . head is espresso foam and very small , even after a big pour.lacing sticks around throughout the beer , so good retention , but this is appearance we 're talking about so ... in this order : alcohol ( astringent ) , hops of english to english-american hybrids ( perhaps perle or challenger ? ) , roasted and black patent barley malts ( also astringent ) . i know i know , a porter with big hops ... just telling it like it is . *amendment* when it warms the hops settle down and the malts come out in a big way , eclipsing the alcohol . still , not easy to smell'em . a pleasant surprise . chocolate , caramel , and very light coffee and roasted barley characteristics . hops are indeed both bready soft and spicy hop , leading me to once again assume an english-american hybrid like challenger or something.alcohol is way , way in the back and barely noticeable . i would give this one a five , but for the style there could be stronger , more varied flavors . smooth and creamy . the lack of head gives way to a nice carbonation that helps to increase the smoothness . what can i say , its not too syrupy and not too watery . the mouthfeel is like velvet . creamy , smooth , crisp , carbo bite ... very nice . someone send me a beermail telling me how this could have a better mouthfeel and i 'll consider it and potentialy change my review . great brew . lacking in areas , but makes up for in taste and mouthfeel , which are big sellers for me . could even see myself sessioning this one , though i would be pretty f'ed up after a whole four pack of this sweet nectar .

0.40 0.60 0.20 0.30 0.30	hazy golden . thin dirty white head . splotchy patches of lace are left behind . big bouquet of hops on the nose . very fragrant . minty . garlicy . and yes , onion powder too . flavor follows suit . actually , a fairly weak body to support much of anything . hop flavors are onion and garlic . malts are missing altogether in the flavor profile . quite weak with hop flavors that do n't appeal to me . i liked chameleon 's witbier . not this one though .

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.80 0.90	a delightful golden color graced by a pale yellow head . i did n't get much lacing , but i believe that was due to a freshly-washed glass ( served at a bar ) . nice hops come through in this one . it is a little bitter and spicy , but also has some good vanilla and tones of malt . not the most fantastic example of its style , but tasty and very drinkable .

0.90 1.00 0.60 0.90 0.80	tall 1 pint can into a pint glass . pours a hazy sunset color with a dense , foamy white head that leaves rings of dense , foamy lace . intense aroma of citrusy and grassy hops that almost has a smokiness to it that adds so much to the smell . taste is consistent with the smell , but the smokiness does n't make an appearance until the aftertaste , creating a very cool effect . mouthfeel is a little too weak for my tastes , and is the only fault i can find with this brew . i 've been on a bit of a pale ale bent lately and was starting to get sick of them , but daisy cutter has definitely piqued my interest again .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.40	what can be said about robert the bruce that he can not say himself . just take a sip and get lost in the nearly overpowering flavor explosion and the creamy tingly mouthfeel of this wondrous scottish ale . when three floyds brews a beer they usually do it right and rtb is no exception . great beer to start the night off , or to pair with a big-ass deep dish pizza

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 1.00	this beer is not retired . it 's now sold with a nearly identical label that says `` double india pale ale . '' from a bottle that 's been sitting in the cellar for a few months and has the old label . this is definately smoother than the draft version , but that 's neither good nor bad . pours a nice amber with fluffy white head . smells quite fruity and tastes it . starts with pineapple , before diving into pine and citrus . no big d apparent like in some middle ages brews , just lots of delicious hops without much malt flavor . not the most complex dipa , but pretty tasty and incredibly drinkable . 10 % what ? give me another bomber .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.40	farson 's lacto milk stout appearance : dark chocolate-brown with a small head that goes to a film . some good lacing . smell : caramel , cocoa , coffee , and a hint of milk . taste : coffee , chocolate , and milk . mouthfeel : feels like a thin milk . overall : this feels very different to me . i believe it is my mind wrapping itself around the milk aspect . i have never had milk in a beer . it is an ok stout . it is definitely worth a try .

0.60 0.50 0.60 0.20 0.20	dated oct 02 . poured light and with a tiny layer of head . bubbles remained present throughout . the taste that was about to follow was not due to skunkyness or old product . for the first time i caught myself actually making a `` ugh-face '' when tasting a brew . i expect this taste from the macro macros . how they can treat this as a winter brew is beyond me . no body , no alcohol presence , nothing to keep me interested . the color was okay for an american lager ( which i was very pleased to see this listed as ... because that is all that it is at best . ) and there was nothing wrong with its mouth presence . i let it warm a bit and as the result went from bad to worse , i poured the rest in the toilet .

0.70 0.50 0.40 0.80 1.00	the smell of this beer reminds me of old pbr in a can that you kick on the beach . its a nice color though . dark red/maroon . the taste is great for a sam adams i can buy in mississippi . the citrus and pine nuts really come through . this is apretty decent beer . nice to have something new in our beer-hating state . i could probably drink a lot if these . and i 'm going to now . .

0.70 0.40 0.70 0.60 0.20	this was a bazaar experience ! i decided to reward myself with this beer and was intrigued at the store when it they had a 1995 reserve in 2006 . the cork broke when i tried to remove it and i noticed it was soaked all the way through . i 'm guessing the cork was not made to last 10 years and the beer probably was n't either . another note ... this bottle is only 8.45 ounces and it is still quite a shortfill ! dodging the specks of cork in the drink , i took a smell and it was almost like that of a tomato mixed with vinegar . the appearance is a reddish brown with absolutely no head or carbonation and the surface suggests that the beer is considering separation but has n't . i have to say it tastes a little like blood on the front palatte and the back palatte is more of an alcohol taste this was a great experience as it is one of the highest alcohol content beers i have had and because it is the oldest beer i have had . it is not easy to drink and now that i have rated it i 'm going to get some pizza to finish the rest with . even though this is a shortfill ... it is still really hard to finish . on a more positive note , i should mention that the bottle is quite a work of art . the cork is burried in plastic . the bottle appears black when filled and has gold lettering on it . when empty the bottle shows it 's true color , which is blue .

0.70 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.60	from a bottle best before april 2012 . poured into a tulip glass . a : deep brown , almost opaque , light tan head quickly fades into a ring . s : light cocoa with some roasted malts . very faint and underwhelming . t : chocolate and roasted malts , slight sweet malts at the end . rather bland . m : creamy with fizzy carb . o : i do n't like that sam adam 's forces their boston lager on the drinker to try new beers . if they had simply made their holiday pack only their seasonal brews this would get a slightly higher rating . i do n't want your boston lager , i want your seasonals , stop pushing it on me .

0.40 0.50 0.20 0.30 0.30	12 oz bottle pours a limpid yellow body with a small white head that quickly vanishes without a trace . aroma is subtle , some clove and faint fruit . mouthfeel is nearly flat . insipid and watery . taste has some clove , maybe a hint of banana , and some yeast . not much to note . i hope this was an off bottle but looking at other reviews leads me to believe otherwise .

0.70 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70	this is beer ? ? it tasted and smelled more like a wine than it did a beer and therefore it was very much not to my liking . it poured a large sized tan frothy head that consisted of fine-small bubbles . the body was opaque and carbonated with a red hue . the nose reminded me of pure wine as did the flavor . the mouthfeel was tingly , tangy , bitey and medium bodied . there was a fair amount of lacing with this beer .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.80 0.80	amber and clear , it pours with a copious dense slightly off-white head and a medium amount of carbonation . there is a very small amount of very fine particulates floating around . very muted aroma , faint amounts of pine , but not your typical west coast ipa . judging by previous reviews , i wonder if there have n't been any changes . well balanced front end with mild sweetness playing off of the bitterness . lots of bitterness in the back end . very big and chewy mouthfeel

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.80	i 've really been looking forward to this beer . its been sitting it my brewroom for a month , and i thought that i 'd try it today after bottling a belgian blonde of my own creation . my fear was that this would be a generic bsda : warming alcohol presence , nuttiness , dried fruits in the aroma . however , this one stood out well among the crowd . now , those things listed above are all true of this beer , but are very well defined and more deeply present than in most . its appearance was somewhat disappointing . rather than being muddled , it was deeply turbid . the yeast integrated itself so fully into the pour as to look plain hazy . the head was full but small , though persistent . beautiful aroma of dates and figs , subtle honey , very rich . flavor followed suit , with a nice mellow hop presence that balanced a truly sweet palate that prevented any cloying stickiness . wonderful full mouthfeel . did n't feel turbid or gritty as the appearance might have suggested . great brew !

0.70 0.80 0.70 1.00 1.00	a - cloudy.. no wait hazy ( ha..ha.. ) purple color . small head but with tons of lacing . s - this beer is listed as a raspberry wheat beer , so huge shocker here that it reeks of raspberries . with first smell , it 's raspberries . on second smell , it 's raspberries . need i continue ? there 's a bit of malt and wheat somewhere hidden in between the raspberry sandwich . t - based on the smell i was thinking it would be an overwhelming raspberry taste similar to how sam adams cherry wheat is when it comes to the cherry taste . surprisingly , the front of the beer is sweet and malty . but.. shortly after that it gives way to a raspberry taste that absolutely dominates your palate . it 's a pleasant raspberry taste though that fulls up your mouth and lingers on your tongue in the aftertaste . m - light bodied with medium to high carbonation . despite the raspberry aftertaste , it 's actually a smooth finish . d - it 's a very drinkable beer . if my girlfriend who hates beer thought that , `` it 's not bad '' that should tell you a thing or two . it goes down very easy and it 's definitely a beer i would like to have , and enjoy again .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.40 0.60	so ... yeah , i had one full glass of oa dark lord an hour ago . it 's was horrendous . i got my toes crushed by the keg and then when i tasted it after waiting a couple hours for it , it just was a huge let down . looked pretty good , the smell was average of average dl , no vanilla or oak in the scent . taste- wow , this sucks . i 'm sorry , normal '09 dl = omg . '09 oa dl=bad . no taste of oak at all and overpoweringly sweet . the few drops i had of kaggen and surly two beat the shit out of this brew . mouthfeel- good , just like normal dl , thick and delicious . drinkability- it tasted awful , somewhat like '08 darkness awful . i can see if people like it , but it had no taste of oak at all . none . no wood . vanilla bean dl was amazing though .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.90	served at in de vrede , westvleteren , belgium on 3/20/2010 . a- poured into a wesvleteren challice with a thin 1/4 '' head of white foam with some very nice lacing . the head was nicely retained . the body was a very turbid and well-carbonated yellow color . s- initial impressions of pale malt , belgian yeast aromatics , and a touch of brett . very crackerlike on the nose overall . there 's something else there , some faint phenolic that i ca n't quite put my finger-on . as the beer warmed-up , it 's aroma blossomed , becoming much more rich with crackerlike pale malt and more moderate brett than initially present . t- a perfect replicate of the nose : pale malt , belgian yeast esters , mild to moderate barnyardy flavors , some little phenolics , no tartness at all . it finishes quite dry with an echo of that malty and barnyardy flavor . m- a very substantial body . a really big , full body- almost a bit chewy , which is something you do n't expect from a lower-alcohol blonde beer . a little creaminess is complimented by this very soft carbonation you get throughout the drink . for the style , this is an exceptional mouthfeel . d- goes down really smooth and easy . nothing overbearing about it . quite refreshing as well .

0.60 0.50 0.70 0.40 0.50	picked up a few bottles at the brewery on a trip through town . pours a pretty clear red color with thin head and spotty lacing . smell is sweet and malty , but slightly watery and non-descript . taste is very similar with a strong buttery diacetyl flavor to it that really does n't help matters . medium bodied and smooth . this is a pretty disappointing red ale ... i finished it but i definitely wo n't buy again . tasted on 7/28/08 .

0.60 0.50 0.30 0.50 0.60	my prevailing perception of this beer was `` zzzzzz . '' it was quite boring , even for an irish dry stout . a frequent discussion thread on this sight and others is `` good gateway beer for a bud/miller/coors drinker , '' and i would nominate this beer . that is not intended as a compliment . this beer is black , but beyond that is about as interesting as a bud light . flavor and aroma is minimal , and mouthfeel is dominated by a thin watery character . this beer is really uninteresting , but i guess there is nothing really offensive about it . still , i ca n't say i 'd recommend it .

0.70 0.80 0.90 0.70 0.80	a : pours a bright , coppery amber with a modest but dense white head . gradually dissipates to a foamy ring , leaving plenty of lacing . s : sweet biscuit malts with slightly grassy hops . hints of caramel , honey , and candied fruit . t : sweet , bready malts balanced with floral hops , plus some nice undertones of roasted malts and fresh fruit . m : carbonation is crisp but smooth , bolstering the somewhat light body . the finish is dry and enduring without being overpowering ; it 's a pleasant , floral astringency with roasty notes . d : very drinkable on account of the standard abv , smooth mouthfeel , and lasting , bitter finish . a good english pale ale , on the whole .

0.60 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	i picked up a carton of this pretty cheap the only downfall its in cans anyways it pours a golden amber see thru colour with nice carbonation that leaves a bubbly two finger head and sporadic lacing , the aroma is pretty macro with grains and a feint bubblegum aroma , it has a thin mouthfeel with a rather grainy taste and isnt nothing to write home about , its definately better than the macroswill that sells for much more and easier to down but its not a beer that i would drink if i wanted a nice beer with character .

0.70 0.90 1.00 0.80 0.90	for once , i must say that the ba gurus were slightly off ; i took the glassware advice of an oversize wineglass for this selection & im afraid it killed the head a bit . that aside , it does lace quite nicely & the steady stream of bubbles in pearl necklace patterns shooting up to meet their brethren at the top is mesmerizing . the liquid is a hazy , honey-colored nectar & , when paired with the aforementioned descriptors , more than makes up for the anemic head . the next time i have this beer ill be sure to pour it into a slightly smaller vessel . perhaps a score upgrade will be in order . cider , sour cherry , yeast , lavender & a definite alcohol aroma fill the nose setting up what could be a potentially kick-ass quaffing experience . before even discussing taste , i cant help but notice the texture ; creamy/feathery on the tongue , so much so that i thought it had evaporated rather than been swallowed . by the time i was able to get over this strange but lovely sensation i was struck by a sour/bitter aftertaste that seemed to owe more to malt than hops . just ever so slightly unpleasant on this count . subsequent sips reveal a malt/spice interplay which is interrupted every so often by a faint sweetness ( apple-like in nature ) . as previously noted , i adore the way this feels in my mouth . creamy but light , active but not overly-carbonated . outstanding in this area ; amongst the best ive had . although its on the strong side ( durrr , its a belgian-style ! ) don de dieu is scary drinkable . be careful or you could have trouble speaking english by the end of the night , let alone french !

0.50 0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60	pours a pale yellow , slight haze , big fluffy white head , sticky lace and decent retention . smell is sweet , honey , citrus , floral , maybe some vanilla , not bad . taste is sweet and malty , kind of sugary , citrus and minerals . mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation , creamy and refreshing .

0.90 0.70 0.30 0.30 0.40	330ml bottle out of my harpoon tulip . a- nice opaque black . the foamy head almost looks like an espresso , with hints of white and mocha . the lacing clings to the glass as i make my way through it . s- sweet notes of mesquite tequilla and oak . an interesting background blend of hops , chocolate , and coffee . the tequilla is different , but honestly slightly off-putting t-it is very smooth and chocolatey sweet at first . a crazy blend of hops , smokey tequilla , and peaty oak then just punish the tongue . i hate mescal style tequilla , and this is very reminicent of that . i pick up the in the honey in the initial flavor , and some slight coffee flavor as well . not really any vanilla . m- overall it punishes my palate , and after a while i was n't looking forward to trying to drink more . the aftertaste was not very good , and rather bitter . o- while i think this is an improvement of the base beer from the last batch of black hole , the barrel aging did not do this one well . while i love tequilla , i 'd be curious to know what kind of barrels these were aged in . -gfunk

0.70 0.90 0.40 0.70 0.40	poured from a bottle into a snifter . listed as a stout , but poured a much lighter color , one that would be more associated with a darker barleywine or old ale . the smell was of cranberries and some jasmine , with a hint of alcohol . the cranberries and jasmine were both present in the taste , but the alcohol was very much in the front . as far as mouthfeel , the cranberries and jasmine were in the front , but the alcohol burn took over in the end , i could feel when this one reached my stomach . this beer is 18.2 % , and i could feel this with every sip . this beer is not totally undrinkable , but there is no way i would want to even smell another one of these after having one . purely a sipper , and one that should probably end an evening of drinking ( provided that you did n't drink all that much ) . overall a worthwhile and enjoyable beer to try , but know what you are getting into !

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.60 0.80	a : pours a hazy golden yellow with a fluffy white head . good lacing with this one . s : grapefruit , clove and coriander rise up with the smell of wheat and roasted grains . citrus hops come through clean . t : wheat , coriander , white grapes and a smack of citrus hops . hops also come with some white pepper spiciness . m : light body and smooth tight carbonation . a bit on the watery side . d : summer beer for sure and easy to drink a few and not be tired of the flavors .

0.40 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.80	poured into a mug from one of their cute 12 oz bottles smell was a little stronger than i had expected but was very much like a regular budweiser you know the classic beer smell . the head was fizzy an white an lasted 30 seconds with no lacing the body was light an easy to drink but very carbonated once again reminded me of your plain ol budweiser maybe a nice change from bud if thats what you drink all the time , the taste was slightly sweet , nothing overpowerin nothing strong at all about it and a hair on the watery side but it goes down well . the drinkability of this is excellent on account it is so light an really smooth with little to no aftertaste . i would say this is a good beer for a light beer drinker and a day at the lake or beach . plus the bottle looks so cool you cant help but pick up a sixer .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	very dark , looks black in the glass . a thin head that is beige in colour sits on top . a little bit of head seems to hold on for the long run . smells of dark fruit mostly . plum and raisin . mixed in is a bit of red licorice . very malty indeed . taste expands on the aroma , revealing the mass of malt in this one . very rich toffee , baked sweets , faint creamy coffee . finish has a black licorice character to it , a bit too much of that flavour for my tastes . overall effect is very sweet , malty and packed with flavour . mouthfeel is very smooth , perhaps my favourite part of this beer . full bodied with subtle carbonation , it feels just right . the first time i had this , i was disappointed . the second time , i felt sure that this one was way overhyped . this is the third bottle i 've had , and i think i 'm starting to see what people are raving about .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.90	a- very good appearance . thick black crud . light brown head , that laces beautifully . looks like foam on cappuccino . s- smell is hints of coffee and chocolate . pretty basic nose . t- is coffee upfront , with bittersweet hops coming in the middle . finishes clean . i also detect some mocha . a powerful mouth smack . sweet and hoppy at the same time . m- this one handles clean and smooth on the palate . many similar brews fall victim to sticky and oily textures . this one packs a wallop in taste but finishes very clean . d- a very good session beer . i enjoyed this one while watching the celtics in the post season . fit perfectly in the evening and the experience .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60	this stout could use some roasted barley . with a near-white head , very little in the way of roasted quality in the nose or taste , and a very thin body , this reminds me of a weak porter with a slight coffee aroma . i 'm also picking up a semi-sour , odd house flavor from these dominion beers . i 'd like to try their oak barrel stout , but the rest of their beers i 've had have been merely average .

0.50 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	12 oz bottle for $ 1.69 from bello vino in aa a : pours a pale orange with no head at all . weird , bad bottle maybe ? from a distance looks cloudy like a hefe , but a closer look shows its tons of suspended sentiment . s : smells like a tripel , with some malts , fruits , and candy sugar/bubble gum `` belgian '' smell . t : starts out as one would expect , but finishes with a huge honey sweetness . m : a decent body , a little sticky , but no carbonation . d : way too sweet . either a lower abv or the sugar drowns it out , as the alcohol is not apparant . almost feel like i 'm drinking a glass of kool-aid or juice with this , between the honey , lack of alcohol , and no carbonation . either this take on the style is n't for me , or i got an off bottle . i 'll have to try again some day and update if necessary .

0.60 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.90	a : crystal clear , slightly yellow ; pours with some nice white head ; no retention or lace . s : faint aroma of fresh floral/earthy hops . relatively pleasant for a macro lager . t : not a lot of flavour . slightly sweet , but with a crisp , dry finish . seems to have a little more bitterness than your average macro lager . not much hop flavour , but the slight floral taste is nice ... it certainly is n't repulsive like some ! a hint of buttery diacetyl . m : very light body , moderate carbonation . d : although i personally do n't find it overly enticing , it is like water ! thanks len !

0.80 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.40	thanks to masterski for this one . enjoyed while watching the second period of game 7 between the canes & the bruins last night . poured from a 12oz . bottle , best before march 2010 . appearance : pours a clear but slightly hazy body with thick 3 finger white head . not bad , better than i expected . smell : picking up some corn and grainy cereal but not too much of the famous skunky aroma associated with n.a. 's . smells lively , not too bad . taste : same grainy aspect with slight bitterness but finishes a little acidic . a bit bland but thankfully no skunkiness . mouthfeel : all downhill from here . good carbonation but has this metallic feel to it . it eases to a clean finish as it warms but still have that feeling lingering in my mouth . drinkability : at first , i though i was going to pour it out because of the almost offensive metal taste but it suddenly disappeared . still , it made it difficult and not entirely pleasant . overall : i can appreciate a good n.a . but for me this one did n't do it . that weird metal taste stuck to me even though it did disappear midway through it still left it 's trace on me . it upset my stomach a little and i would n't try it again .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.60 0.60	a : dark brown color , quickly disappating head . high carbonation . s : not very much nose at all to this beer . even after it warmed up . not like most bell 's beers . t : mild taste . not `` robust '' . very strange . i have never had a bell 's beer seem so bland . m : watery , high carbonation . felt like i was drinking a diet soda . very disappointing ! d : this would be easy to drink , because there is not much to it at all . this is the only beer from bell 's that i have ever had that did not meet expectations for the style .

0.60 0.70 0.40 0.60 0.60	oxford raspberry wheat is a hazy amber ale with no head . the aroma is sweet . it smells like a raspberry bush or a raspberry pastry or raspberry candy . it has a light body and a tannic finish . it has a leafy flavor and reminds me of tea ... raspberry tea . ( rated aug 1 , 2007 )

0.90 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.50	22 oz . bottle . pours a dark black with a creamy tan head . aroma is very smokey , however not overly intense . very rich flavor of dark malts and smoke , with hints of coffee and chocolate as well . the finish is almost all smoke , much too intense for my liking . ive used this many times in making caribou pot roasts in the crockpot . they even have a recipe on their website , which is delicious . i was informed that this beer has won more medals at the great american beer festival than any other beer , quite an accomplishment .

0.80 0.90 1.00 0.90 0.70	this 2004 bottle of thomas hardy 's ale ( no . p17657 ) poured a hazy , dark caramel color with a creamy light tan head on top . the foam dissolved slowly to a thick ring around the surface , leaving a few spots of lace behind . a strong caramel malt aroma with notes of alcohol and brandy hovers above the beer . each sip of this thick bodied brew is smooth and syrupy . the flavor is mainly caramel malt . there 's some notes of fruit ( cherry , apple ) and alcohol mixed in . it reminded me of a brandy . it finishes a bit sour leaving behind some caramel and alcohol notes . i found the aftertaste lasted a lot longer than the average beer . thomas hardy 's ale is a great full flavored brew . however , with 11 % alcohol it 's definitely a sipping beer . aging this bad boy would benefit the flavor by smoothing out some of the alcohol .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.50 0.60	thanks to jahuneyc for this long-sought brew . now let 's see if its any good ... best by 3/11 ... a - the pour is shiny black , capped with a significant amount of mocha froth , and depositing a solid wall of lace upon the glass ' side . it is either visibly on the thinner side for the style , or i am now prejudiced by my repeated exposure to the chunky viscosity that is ccb ( zhukov , hunahpu ... ) s - the nose is unusually sweet , like a milk stout ; this is my first impression . i get small roast-y notes , some green grass and ester-y fruitiness . surprisingly devoid of deep roast character i.e . coffee , chocolate , etc . smells smaller than an ris . t - initial impression : ( slight ) disappointment . the depth of character is lacking in the flavor . the aromas discerned by the nose are not improved or expanded upon . there is a basic roastiness that seems to be fused with a slight lactic tartness , and there you have the malt side ... there is green grassy hop that does n't mesh . finally , there is a sweetness that melds with the alcohol and yeast-driven esters that lends an interesting but not entirely well-placed fruitiness to the brew . this is not bad . it just is n't good , either . m - perfect creaminess , but a bit thin . close to nailing it . d - a letdown , overall . the d-r milk stout is better .

0.70 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.90	in my opinion , flying dog brewery has created a great seasonal , smooth-tasting beer with very little bite or after taste . i would definitely recommend it to any self-respecting beer drinker who might be having an end-of-summer party this or any october .

0.40 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.70	so here 's the thing ... we found this bottle solo at a local beer store . the bottle looks a little weathered and on the back label the numbers 1 , possibly 4 , and 10 are ticked . whatever the grade , keep this is in mind ... a- pours a light yellow with a sizable white head that disappears almost immediately leaving a ring of head around the edges and coming up from the etching at the bottom of the goblet . there are also a lot of chunks of stuff ... which an internet search deems normal but i 'm deducting points for . s-cidery or meadlike . sweet with some little alcohol . a little like if canned fruit cocktail juice fermented ... t- sweet with some bitterness and maybe even a little sour ( throw salt in their and i 've covered all my taste bases ) ... like fermented apple cider . m- dry , maybe even champagne-like . o- the appearance is just so far out of my comfort zone , i ca n't not penalize it . that said , the taste , smell and mouthfeel were fine , but not stunning in any way . no need to ever try this again , but maybe it 's for the connoisseurs .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70	this poured a dark and hazy mahogany with very little tan head . it smelled very strange , like roasted orange and malt . the flavor was just as strange , like oak and honey with some malt and hops , fairly sweet but only slightly bitter . it was watery with lots of carbonation , and had a mild and sugary aftertaste . overall this was a very strange drink , but it was enjoyable .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.80	enjoyed at the brewpub over a long afternoon during xmas vacation . the beer was a pale yellow colour with a slight haze . the head quickly receded to a long lasting white collar that left some spots of foam stuck to the glass . the aroma was simple , but good - cereal malts with spicy hops . bitterness was very light , as were the malts , but there was some cereal and fruit character . light bodied with average carbonation . the texture was a bit soapy and it was a little dry . overall , a nice beer , quite refreshing .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.60 0.80	this beer has a darkish amber colour and nice 1 cm head . the smell is of citrus , hops and some breadiness . the wheatiness is immediately apparent along with some malt . the aftertaste is sour and yeasty . this beer feels great in the mouth , but i do n't love the flavour .

0.40 0.50 0.70 0.50 0.60	.5l green bottle ours deep rub red/chestnut with a 3 fingers deep sand colred head . no lacing or head retention , whatsoever s : super sweet , treacle & hints of glue or is it diathechtyl ? t : cloying sweet up front with roasted grainyess on its heels . breadyness & brown sugar follows . dryness & fruittyness ( apricots & raisins ) come through as this warms as well as some tobacco notes . finishes with roasted grain , licorice & dryness . maybe i should 've let this warm a little more ? ? mf : oily with low/medium carbonation drinks slow , due to the cloying sweetness . i 'd like to try a known fresh sample & see how it stacks up , thought this would be better

0.40 0.30 0.30 0.40 0.80	i only give it a 4 on drinkability because you can chug it like there 's no tomorrow . the appearance is pale yellow like a discharge we know . the taste is thin because they use very little malt and use rice syrups to boost the alcohol , strohs is not really good , but it 's way better than bud . bud has an eerie similarity among all its breweries . quality control , or what . only drink if you have to . compliment the host .

0.70 0.50 0.80 0.40 0.50	this beer was nothing special . it had a decent look , nice golden color with a white head that quickly went away . the smell was very grainy . the taste was also the same . it had a characteristic that was all its own and i ca n't really put my finger on it . not a beer i would drink again .

0.70 0.70 0.90 0.70 0.70	i 've had a few capital beers over the last few days , before which i 've had little exposure to this brewery . all ( blonde doppelbock , munich dark , baltic porter ) have struck me as lacking the flavor intensity of competitive beers of the same styles . these beers are n't bad , just muted , and that is the impression that this beer gave me as well . this beer poured dark with a nice tan head from the beer engine . aroma was fainter than i expected , but with some nice roastiness and hints of toffee/caramel . flavor was again a bit fainter than i expeted , but had some good dark roast to it , but i did n't detect much else there . hand-pump imparted a great smooth mouthfeel . i 'd have this beer again , but i ca n't say that when it comes to baltic porters or imperial stouts this one is tops on either list . i had this off the hand-pump at roman 's pub ( milwaukee ) .

0.60 0.30 0.60 0.30 0.20	12 ounce bottle , not for retail sale sample . very light in color , with a filmy head . sweet fruits and pumpkin spice aroma , seems way off for the style . flavor is absolutely nothing like an oud bruin . where do i begin ? sweet beyond belief , not sour at all , no barrel character.was this even aged in wood ? . the bacteria cultures just didnt seem to work any magic . really , really just awful and a drain pour for me . i sampled this next to russian river supplication and this beer absolutely tasted and smelled like nothing , when compared to the supplication . i sampled what i believe was a non bottle conditioned sample , so if my score ends up being against that grain , ill pony up and by a liter .

0.80 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70	picked this up at rick 's in alexandria , va two days ago for $ 5.99 . poured from a 22 oz . bottle into my bell 's tulip . a - pours a somewhat transparent reddish mahogany brown color with two fingers of off white head and moderate carbonation evident . head lasts for several minutes and leaves some nice spotty lacing on the glass . s - smells of citrus hops , fruity malts , pine hops , light floral notes . not overly hoppy but they are there . overall pretty nice . t - tastes citrus hops , fruity malts , caramel malts , bready malts , and light pine hops . a lot more malts than the nose , and less hops , with some light bitterness . a step down from the nose . m - medium body and low carbonation . definitely seems to be undercarboned , which hurts it . pretty smooth , with some very light bitterness . o - overall a decent dipa , but very undercarbonated which hurts it . some nice hops in the nose but the taste is more malt forward . worth checking out but not my favorite dipa , and not a hop bomb by any means .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.40	app : pour 12 oz into wine goblet , inch of persistent head . golden straw cloudy , plenty of bubble streams aroma : fruity notes peach/nectarine/apricot tropical notes , pineapple ? taste : quite light which is strange with all the other heavy hitting going on in this brew , light fruit notes , some banana , dry finish . mouthfeel : a lot of presence , cut by the appropriately lively carbonation , but helped to the finish by how dry it is . drinkability : really a lot heavier than usual saison of course , verging on oily . really too much for regular quaffing , but one is nice .

0.40 0.60 0.40 0.80 0.80	aroma : plums and fruit aroma . slight alcohol . appearance : dark brown to black color . small head when poured aggressively . no lacing . flavor : more fruit carries over to flavor . medium coffee flavor and roast that carries into aftertaste . medium bitterness , no perceivable hop flavor . mouthfeel : smooth , low mouthfeel . fairly dry . alcohol noticeable but not overdone . very little carbonation . overall : i was surprised at how fruit driven this beer was . dark roast plays into secondary flavors . mouthfeel really hurts this beer , wondering if i got a bad bottle . overall , not a bad beer , not one i would seek out in the future .

0.80 0.60 0.90 0.70 0.80	poured from bottle into pint glass . a - pours a pretty standard porter-brown with a nice creamy head that has decent retention and noticeable lacing s - smells of roasted malts with a nice sweetness on the back end t - has a fairly overwhelming taste of coffee with a small hint of hoppy bitterness m - great mouthfeel . i really enjoy the way it sits on the tongue , and it has a pleasant level of carbonation that lends it a refreshing quality that i have not seen in many porters d - though it is a good offering of the style , it is not one that i could personally drink more than one or two of in a sitting as it 's quite heavy o - i would classify this among the best of the porters i have tried , but i 'll admit that 's not very many . i do know the difference between a bad beer and a good one however and this is most definitely the latter

0.90 0.50 0.90 0.50 0.80	bland , dull , vapid , humdrumall of these words describe this beer , surprising me . this is not like the fantome that i know and love . i must assume that this is a bad bottle , however , i will review it because there are no terrible qualities . this one just seems muffled and boring . appearance is great . the bottle pops with an explosive orce . the crown is huge , lasting and magnificent . the body the perfect color , cloudy stawlike gold . the sediment is a bit on the high side . using a decanter is a good idea for this beer . smellnot much . i get a little straw , a little sour twang , some lemon grass , some wheat , peach here , pepper there but all are muddled . this beer smells like it would if i had a cold , but i dont have one . its just not very pungent or exciting . taste is just like smell . floral notes and citric acid . light fruits . nicebut weak . mouthfeel is alright . sweet front , slightly sour finish and just a bit of tang . thinbut thickening towards the end . bitter in some ways , juicy and sweet in others . very complex as it should be . drinkability : even this seemingly off sample is highly drinkable . ill try again and rereview at the next opportunity . i expect positive results .

0.40 0.50 0.60 0.30 0.50	a : packaged in a clear bottle , the beer is very light in colour . a small head when poured which dissipated quickly . s : a slight aroma of hops . not too much going on here . t : there is a slight sweetness and next to no bitterness . there is a promising fruity start which quickly gives way to the metallic taste of the aussie macro lager . a short , sickly finish . m : not too bad , there was a little bit of body . carbonation was a bit heavy . d : fairly easy to drink , although i think the sweetness would grate on me a bit . it would be ok if the day was hot and the beer was on ice . it 's fairly obvious from the clear bottle that this is a beer conceived in the marketing department at boag 's . it tastes like it too . another shitty aussie lager to add to the pile . most disappointing .

0.80 0.60 0.60 0.80 1.00	i always drink my high life out of cans ! this beer is a nice dark golden color that looks good in my glass . it looks like beer , smells like beer , and tastes like beer ... to keep it simple . drinkability is off the charts ! this is my go-to macro , and will always be as long as miller keeps it the same ! prost !

0.90 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.80	very dark brown in color that you can see through when held to the light . full light-tan head . some very light hop aromas followed by the sweet maltiness with chocolate and coffee mixed in there , as expected . some fruity raisin/prune/fig flavors . overall very malty and sweet . the sweet chocolate is definitely there , but not as much as i would like . the hops come through a little in the background . the malty flavors are predominant . it 's very creamy and smooth and a little chewy . there 's a fair amount of carbonation that you feel in the swallow . very easy to drink and delicious .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.60	originally reviewed february 19 , 2005 . 12 oz bottle . nice earthen pour . thin white head , with poor lacing . malty , lacking hops . caramel and apple pie tones , backed with a very faint floral . not overly watery , sustains decently on the palate . generally weak .

0.20 0.20 0.60 0.20 0.60	12 oz . can a : piss colored beer ; it looks like every other cheap light beer , yellow and very carbonated . s : smells like air and corn preservatives . t : tastes like water and corn starch . the corn is unpleasant and the bitterness is awkward . m : decent mouthfell , it has to have this considering how light it is . d : it 's light beer , so it 's drinkable . i like it better than bud and miller light , but frankly i ca n't imagine someone drinking this for any reason other than to get drunk or so they can show off that they had a beer .

0.50 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	bottle from awesome girlfriend from total wine in tampa . pours ... well ... i have never actually had a beer that i pour into a glass and there is zero liquid . there is usually some tiny amount ... but this had none . so ... 30 minutes later ... turns out to be a rich brown with a nice bouquet of cherry and sour , and some funk , along with a chemical pungent odor ... taste is a nice mild sour cherry ... it does have that chemical taste to it on the finish , though ... and it gets stronger as you drink it . overall , not too bad , but the chemical taste to it really dampers it for me ... and really leaves something to be desired in the aftertaste ... the more i drink this the harder it becomes to drink ... the first few sips were good , but man this just begins to coat the tongue , and becomes very chemical tasting . i had a hard time finishing this .

0.70 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.80	a - poured out of the bottlem the color is close to lemonade ... .imagine that . though it is very clear and poured with a finger and a half of head . s - ugh , it smells like cheap hotel lemon cleaner ... . t - i imagine this is what hotel lemon cleaner tastes like . a lemonade flavor that seems watered down followed by a slight bitterish beer flavor . m/d - weak and thin mouthfeel . in hot weather where i am drinking a lot over a long day , i could really get into it .

0.80 0.80 0.40 0.60 0.60	a : 1/8 '' mocha coloured head over cola coloured liquid . s : toasted malt , coffee , chocolate and anise . t : bitter flavours of toasted malt and coffee . expected more based on the smell profile . m : thin viscosity and a very high level of soda-like carbonation . o : i enjoy most of russell 's products but to be honest i was disappointed in this one .

0.80 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.40	a : a deep amber or reddish body with a fast receding tan head that leaves sticky lacing . s : nothing too complex . some toasted caramel malts with a hint of earthy hops ( but very little ) . t : sweet toasted malts upfront with notes of caramel . kind of buttery , but is cut short by some bittery hops . semi-dry finish and pretty one-dimensional . m : medium-light body ; moderate carbonation ; smooth and clean mouthfeel . o : nothing too complex or interesting in this beer . got it in a combo pack . nothing worth searching out and not the best example on the style .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.60	oddly mediocre for something i 've anticipated for a long time . 2003 vintage , complete with cork . pours a midnight black with a collar of brown head . no lacing . like the surface of a pond devised by satan . aged cider nose with treacle does n't bode too well . chocolate , cider , whiskey , soy , burned coffee and molasses combine into one unholy melange of a beer , which quickly oscilates between great and ghastly . its a schizophrenic brew , and quite unlike anything i 've had before . oily mouthfeel with next to no carbonation . quite thick and heavy , coating every area of the mouth . the peripherals are good , but that 's about it . blech .

0.40 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.80	what can i say other than that this is the perfect beer when you want something dirt cheap to drink when you are outside on a hot day doing some yard work . appearance - clear yellow/gold ... like all the domestics . foamy head goes away in about 3 minutes . smell - a bit metallic but i do get a bit of hoppiness . i also get a grassy type smell . taste - nothing to write home about . a bit sweet for a domestic which in this case is a good thing . had a little hoppyiness and a bisquit/bready taste . no aftertaste mouthfeel - not complex at all . very carbonated ... .too much . drinkability - like what has already been said . on a hot day i can throw a lot of these back ... .but it also gives me the worst headache . out of all of the domestics this one is my favorite non-light beer . it seves one purpose which is to refresh . i have to admit though ... .i do think it is kind of cool that it has developed the cult following recently ... i also like that they are not huge on advertising like the others .

0.70 0.70 0.40 0.90 0.80	clear orange amber with big off white foamy head with good lacing . citrus whe.at with hints of spice . little sumpin ' taste bends into a phenolic finish ... at first . alcohol lingers on the palate . a metamorphosis occurs as become accostomed to the flavor and turns to a spicy sweet citrus that is acidic and metallic . mouthcoating is chewy , tacky and fairly unpleasant . pushing through the initial character is difficult but you are rewarded with an unusual yet interesting balanced combination of flavors . the mouthfeel was distracting but it does become a bit more tolerable and almost smooth once the mouthcoating becomes entrenched .

0.70 0.90 0.80 0.60 0.40	12 oz bottle worst label ever . silly d & d theme . small red crest displayed behind the main graphic.. a picture of grass . oh , and a tree . and ? ugh . pours out a rather dark ambery orange.. very rich looking for a tripel and not at all what i expected . the head looks about right though.. a rich , dense foam that quickly becomes a bubble-tight ring floating solidly on the high gravity brew . some bubbles are observed moving through despite the wavy haze caused by the beer 's thickness . this beer smells of cotton candy . the burnt , crispy wet-looking ends of cotton candy . fruity , slightly bubblegummy , with a disappearing phenolic quality that borders on plastic and chewable aspirin.. but warmth kills that last bit of off-scent . i am endlessly fascinated by the overall aroma here . non-traditional but succulent nonetheless . i am enjoying the odor here waaaay too much . time to drink , perhaps ? the alcohol sticks out a bit too much . it 's the first thing i notice and that 's usually not a good thing . lots of sweet , raw grains here and a bit of creamy vanilla in the finish . no hop presence really evident . it 's got a nice mouthfeel , creamy and soft , but is interrupted harshly in the finish by the sting of alcohol on my tongue . further warmth mellows it a bit , and brings out the estery fruitness from the nose . some candied orange rind and perhaps a dose of peaches and cream . complex , but damned by its lack of controlled abv . a decent brew , with some real shining points . not a tripel i would revisit .

0.60 0.70 0.80 0.70 0.50	i believe the name was actually `` oatmalt '' instead of `` oatmeal '' for what it is worth . black , small head without much retention . smell is sweet roastines and a bit of herbs . taste is pleasant , on the sweet side of things with a little acidity that keeps the sweatness from getting annoying . big body , low carbonation . overall pleasant but forgetable . towards the end of the pint the sweetness combined with the big body hurt the drinkability .

0.80 0.50 0.80 0.50 0.50	this beer pours a dark black/brown with just a hint of raisin sneaking through around the edges . the head is a collar of smokey brown . smells of smokey marshmallows , coffee , cough syrup and vomitus . whoa . the healthy sweet grains are nice , but there 's something downright nasty going on here . it clearly is n't spoiled , but rather the way the smoky character blends with the sweetness . the flavor starts with a bit of smokey malts , coffee , brown sugar and caramel , but quickly collapses into a sickly sweet cough syrup that causes me to gag . yikes ! feels dense and present with a pleasing presence to the carbonation that livens things up without being disruptive . nice . i 'm not quite sure what 's going on here , but it triggered a lot of bad reflexes that i would prefer not to get from a beer .

0.80 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	poured from 12 oz . bottle into a sam adams perfect pint glass . appearance : bright and slightly hazy golden yellow with lots of bubbles . big three finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing . smell : wheat and grain with some belgian yeast and lots of spices . smells like some coriander and mesquite spices . hints of lemon and citrus hops . taste : a decent amount of wheat and yeast with plenty of spices . coriander and mesquite mix to give a peppery spiced flavor . also some lemon zest with a light hint of citrus hops . also a hint of cloves . mouthfeel : body is light to medium and slightly watery . carbonation is moderate . very smooth . overall : a pretty good saison that is on the lighter side but still flavorful .

0.50 0.60 0.30 0.50 0.60	pale amber appearance , clear and over bubbly with a spritzy and pale head that lasts all of 15 seconds . practically no lacing or coating on the glass . malty aroma , some mace-like hoppiness and some vegetal sense . flavor is not particularly bad , light brown sugar , slight fruit , and more real hop bite than i expected out of anheuser busch . real loser of a thin mouthfeel and a very stripped down finish . drinkable , if nothing else is available -- if its in someone else 's cooler , i might drink again come summertime .

0.80 0.70 0.40 0.80 0.60	a vigorous pour into my new belgium globe goblet produces an almost three-finger thick , lightly browned , dark tan colored head . the beer is quite black in color , though it does pass just a hint of light through it if held up directly to the light . the aroma smells quite dry and full of roasted , dark malt notes ; reminiscent of well , almost blackened , grain , charcoal , dry espresso , burnt soda crackers and perhaps a hint of a dark grain sweetness . that last may just be my imagination though as this beer is clearly roast dominated and it is hard to get a sense of anything else in the nose . dry with a fizzy , carbonic acidity that sort of adds to the overall dryness . ample flavors of well deeply toasted grain move to more of burnt and even bitter finish that lingers on just a bit after the beer has left my mouth . there is some burnt grain acidity here , though not quite as much as one might expect ( the mash ph seems to have been held well enough in check ) . this actually does get fairly bitter and slightly astringent in the finish from the burnt grain focus . despite being so dry , this does have a touch of body to it , though the fizziness of the carbonation tends to get in the way of the texture despite being fairly light ( in carbonation ) . a couple of vigorous swirls of my glass release most of the carbonation and greatly reduces the harsh carbonic bit and makes this beer more creamy and less astringently burnt . as the beer warms up a bit it even picks up a slight burnt fruitiness that helps to further add a bit of balance . i am a bit surprised to say it , but this is actually probably better on nitro , or preferably from the hand pump ; the reduced carbonation and carbonic acidity would really help to keep this beer more balanced . and the beer does actually smooth out , become more integrated and not as overtly roasted if i vigorously swirl out the carbonation ; serving this on the warm side certainly helps too . not exactly the best beer to be drinking out of the bottle , if you work at it you can turn this into a nicely drinking beer though . i would love to have this served via hand pump from a cask at about 59f / 15c .

0.80 0.50 0.60 0.20 0.20	i was just really let down by my last review ... i 'm hoping this makes up for it ... nice enough looking beer . not quite brown , more of a brown-red . pours a decent off-white head . cloudy but not opaque . uh-oh . i do n't know that corn-on-the-cob is a good smell for a beer to have , but this one is loaded with it . some sweet roasted corn and a bit of yeast . mostly corn . damn . this could be my first drain pour . tastes like rotten corn-on-the-cob . actually , it tastes exactly like a scratch-and-sniff corn-on-the-cob sticker i remember from when i was five or six years old . yuck . i ca n't taste anything else under the corn nastiness . medium bodied with medium carbonation . i only wish this average mouthfeel was supporting an average taste . does n't look that bad or feel too bad but the taste is just horrible . i 've tried this brewery 's recompense on the advise of a friend and was also very disappointed . mort de rire means `` dying of laughter . '' maybe that 's what brasseurs et freres are doing knowing that people are actually buying this stuff . ( my girlfriend thinks all beer tastes the same so i 've passed it over to her . otherwise this would have litterally been poured down the drain . i ca n't believe she does n't know the difference between this and peche mortel ... that does n't make sense . )

0.70 0.60 0.80 0.60 0.60	poured a hazy golden/orange with less than a finger of white head . spotty lacing . the smell was fairly lackluster ; hints of yeast , biscuit , herbs , grassiness , and ever so subtle bubble gum ( candi sugar ? ) . the flavor was dominated by herbal grassiness and yeast ; very little in the way of fruit and spices . pleasantly carbonated on the palate , with a dry finish . victory is phenomenal brewery , but this beer falls short . needs re-engineering .

0.60 0.80 0.50 0.70 0.70	11.2 oz green bottle . pours a deep gold with a fizzy/loud quickly dissipating white head . tons of carbonation bubbles can be seen in the crystal clear liquid . it actually smells like a normal bock , there is n't any skunkiness , just some light toastiness and some caramel . the taste is pretty similar to polish malt liquor , with perhaps a bit more grain . it is very sweet and caramally . the alcohol is detectable but not overt . it is a bit overcarbonated . style wise i would peg this more as a euro strong lager , though in the smell it has bock-like characteristic .

0.70 0.60 0.40 0.80 0.70	first oktoberfestbier of the season ... bought a mixed 6er to test some out ... here goes : a : pours a decent head which quickly dissipates to nothing . i love the caramel orange brown color . s : caramel malts with a bit of a smoky smell . t : thick roasted bittersweet malts . there are hints of nut flavors , even peanuts o.o this beer makes you feel toasty inside . m : medium bodied beer but it is a bit light on carbonation . feels dull and flat . d : the first one tastes nice but i 'm not sure how many i would want . the mouthfeel is really what kills this beer in my mind .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80	2001 : black beer , only appears red nead the edges and bottom of the glass . also , tan head goes away somewhat quickly . nice toasted grain smell along with some caramel . hearty bodied beer , nice example of a heavy porter . good use of dark malts . charcoal burn grain flavor is present but very well intermingled with other tastes such as coffee and dark chocolate . hops bitterness works closely with grain bitterness to keep beer from tasting sweet . very smooth , creamy beer . carbonation kept light so that it does n't take attention away from this robust beer .

0.80 0.60 1.00 0.90 0.80	sampled on draught @ kuhnhenn brewing company in warren , michigan . light golden color . soft malty aroma , with delicate fruit , light grain and lightly floral/herbaceous hops . fresh , incredibly grainy texture and flavor , with a light fruit character and a lush herbal hop flavor , though light . this beer redefines grainy . although i have had several samples of kolsch , i believe this was my first ever true rendition . the brewer is a bjcp judge , so he knows his styles , plus imported samples are usually always old and american samples just generally are not that great . this is how i would imagine beer in cologne . fantastic kolsch .

0.90 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.70	glass : sam adams signature glass a : awesome pillow-like head , about 3-fingers . very clear , light golden color . lots of bubbles coming up to the surface . sticky , soap-like lacing . s : pine and grapefruit rind aroma , slightly musky and earthy . a little bit of pineapple and the faintest bit of toasted malt . simple and straight forward aroma . t : light toasted malt , a little bready up front . mid pallete comes the hops , citrus , floral , slightly musky . finishes with papaya , fresh dough and citrus rind . m : body is on the thinner side , pretty carbonated as well . d : an alright ipa . it 's clean and straight forward . nothing to write home about though .

0.90 0.70 1.00 0.80 0.80	picked up a bottle of this lovely stuff at my local co-op , which is rolling out the dark beers as the real cold part of winter sets in . pours like a slightly watered-down version of the stuff you see running out of your car 's oil pan during a long-overdue oil change . almost no head formed on a careful pour , so i poured a little more briskly to agitate things . about a 1/2 inch head the color of chocolate mousse resulted . the beer itself is completely opaque : i even held it directly up to a light bulb , and not a hint of light made it through . the smell was more subdued than i expected ( especially after trying founders breakfast stout a week or so ago ) . very sweet , dark chocolate with an underlying haze of alcohol -- maybe just the slightest hint of mocha . i was hoping for a bit more or an enticing aroma , but this beer is a teaser in that regard . this stuff reminds me of the breakfast stout , but on steroids . an intense combination of dark chocolate maltiness and bitter coffee up front ; the former subsides to let the coffee flavor take over , which does so with an increasing bitterness . what amazes me about the taste the most is how well the very high alcohol content is masked . i get almost no booze in the front ; it appears as a gradually increasing heat as the coffee aftertaste kicks in , but never gets to the point of overwhelming . in terms of the feel , this is a thick beer . there 's a decent amount of carbonation that sort of transports the viscous stuff around the inside of your mouth . even after you finish one sip , there 's enough clinging to your tongue that you 'll need to swallow again ! overall , this is a very good beer . i felt like i wanted a little more in terms of smell , and the intense coffee bitterness made me think they could have branded it as an espresso stout or something along those lines -- perhaps the coffee thing in dark beers is a founders trademark ? i 'm glad i bought it , and would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good stout , but not the time-honored classic that , say , sam smith 's imperial is .

0.20 0.90 0.40 0.90 0.80	it 's very hoppy but is n't too bitter . it has a nice , distinct taste . it 's almost like berries . it 's also crisp . for a beer that looked so terrible ( albeit , it was dark ) and had such a poor mouthfeel , it sure tasted good . i 'd recommend it to a friend who wants a fun , distinct , unique and drinkable beer with a bit of a kick .

0.50 0.50 0.70 0.40 0.40	been cellaring this 22 oz . bottle for about a year . poured into a duvel glass . a : does n't seem to be any lack in carbonation . nice fizz and a decent 3/4 finger cream-colored head . color is not great- a dark reddish brown , not at all as dark as i expected . when i get to the point that there 's 5 or 6 ounces left in the glass , i can clearly see through it . s : the nose starts out interesting as i pick up raisins , burnt sugar , a little leather and tobacco ? not a lot of the expected roasty/chocolate type aromas , though . kind of strange . t : once again , interesting , but somewhat unexpected . only a hint of the usual stout roasted flavors . more fruity than roasty- figs and raisins . a bit of an unpleasant sourish and very sweet aftertaste . m : lighter in body than i expected , but it 's velvety and smooth . d : not great for me due to the weird aftertaste and lack of dark roasted flavors i want in a stout . unexpected was definitely the theme of the day on this one . sometimes unexpected is good ; this time , not so much . by far my least favorite lagunitas brew i 've tried so far .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	pours out a cloudy pale lemon colored liquid with a soft , pillowing snow white head that stays around forever making lots of sticky lace as you drink . aromas are sort of a funky , farmhouse , bready yeast with some sweet malts . i know this will sound strange but there is something 'warm ' about the aromas . taste is very lightly sweet amber malt with a touch of lemon and then some of that funky , bready yeast and light peppery spices to finish with . aftertaste is slightly spicy and 'spritzy ' with a nice tingle continuing on and on . mouthfeel is tingly and creamy from all of the carbonation . unlike many reviews of this beer , i did not find it overly thin for the style .

0.80 0.50 0.40 0.50 0.70	grabbed a pint on tap at bullfeather 's off state street here in madison . i 've been on a stout kick of late and sadly this just does n't hold up to domestic stouts i 've had . poured jet black with an off-white creamy head that lasted for the entire pint . helps the appearance but ca n't help the smell which is mostly neutral , some faint grainy malts , maybe some metallic notes , that 's about it . taste is rather neutral as well . quite watery with some grainy/oatmeal malts . slightly sweet , but not to any interesting degree . mouthfeel is excedingly thin and watery . i could drink it forever , but i really do n't have a desire to as the palate was right up there with the shiner bock i had last night , which is certainly not saying much . may be the # 1 selling stout in the world but there are countless better options if you give it any serious look at all .

0.60 0.40 0.80 0.70 0.60	a : murky and carbonated . fizzy head . not a lot of lacing . the color is rather appealing , but overall , while i 'm not really put off by it , i 'm not terribly impressed , either . s : i had trouble placing the smell at first , but it almost smells like some kind of rubbery plastic . and i 'm drinking it from a legit beer glass and everything . it kinda reminds me of what my action figures smelled like when i was a kid . t : okay , that 's more like it . it 's got kind of a sweet spiciness to it . i kinda wish it was a bit hoppier than it is . a little extra bitterness would not hurt this beer at all , because it 's almost too sweet , but overall , i like it . m : the carbonation is pretty much just right , and it 's smooth . d : this would be a good session beer , but i really doubt i 'd go for a six pack of this unless someone i was drinking with was set on it . but then i would n't complain . it 's a pleasant beer . i like it . it 's just not really exceptional , especially not at the $ 8.50 ( -ish , after tax ) i paid for this one .

0.80 0.70 1.00 0.90 0.80	pours a brownish amber color with a 1 finger cream colored head . ring like lacing occurs throughout my consumption adding to the appearance . the smell is like freshly baked bread . i have had this bottle for a while so i am thinking some of the hop smell has burned off . my first impression is happiness regarding the hoppiness of this brew . a good deal of bready malts head up the taste with ample west coast pine/lemon hops . within the taste is a roasted barley flavor that blends well into the hop profile . i am also getting some grassy and celery like flavors from the hops . the residual taste is rather bitter and pleasant . this beer has a unique affect of coating the mouth with a sticky feel . it is full in the mouth with plenty of carbonation to tingle the tongue . i would say that this is not the most drinkable beer , especially for its abv . the complexity of this brew keeps me sipping away . this is definitely a 'go to ' beer when wanting something flavorful and delicious .

0.40 0.30 0.30 0.50 0.60	i drank this from a can into a glass in puerto vallarta . it pours a light clear gold with a white head , not much head or lacing . the aroma is light hops and a lot of skunk . the taste is basically the same . the mouthfeel is less than water , is that possible ? drinkable is ok but what 's the point with the abv .

0.80 0.70 0.90 0.60 0.70	poured into a snifter . 4.0 a : hazed medium to dark orange color . two fingers of creamy off-white head with average retention and a small ring of lacing . 3.5 s : not quite as hoppy as i would have expected , but quite nice nonetheless . hops are spicy and grassy foremost with a light citrusy , grapefruit component . the lemon is about as powerful as the hops . malts are mostly neutral with a light sweetness and maybe a hint of crystal . surprisingly clean and free of booziness . yeast gives a touch of breadiness . 3.0 t : lightly biscuity malts with a bready yeast component . just a touch of caramel sweetness . moderate bitterness with piney , grassy , and lightly herbal hops with a touch of grapefruit . lemon adds a nice addition , but overall this is pretty tame for 10 % abv and 100 ibus . again no booze . 4.5 m : heavier medium body . good moderate carbonation . very nice creaminess going on and super smooth . 3.5 d : this is a pretty unexciting beer given it 's stats . this has neither a strong hop component , nor a strong malt component . it 's tasty , but does n't ever make you think that you are drinking something special .

0.90 0.60 0.50 0.60 0.80	this beer pours a very dark brown ( not quite black ) color with copious amounts of creamy light-tan head that lingers around for a while and laces the glass pretty substantially . on the nose all i pick up on is something that reminds me of oats , not much roasty or chocolate or coffee , just toasted oats . almost reminds me of a bowl of cheerios . flavor wise there is a little more roastyness , but not much coffee or chocolate . it has a subtle sweetness to it that i do n't really enjoy with the oats . not exceptionally sweet or thick and creamy as the name would suggest . this beer is on the watery side for a stout , its very drinkable , but just not very creamy and viscous , really lacking in the flavor department too . i almost want to call this an oatmeal stout .

0.90 0.70 0.20 0.20 0.30	a : amber with a 1 finger head . not much haze here . s : hoppy yet very malty . some citrus and caramel . t : chemical off flavors that are heavy with butterscotch . the hops do n't cover up all the bad stuff going on here . whoa diacetyl ! m : there is a chemical like bitterness that really hits you after every sip . i ca n't even drink a pint . i dumped most of it down the drain . d : see mouthfeel . this beer was a drainpour . it is very unexpected from a brewery that usually makes great beer .

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.80 0.90	rohrbach vanilla porter is a cola colored ale with a small beige head that leaves nice lacing on the glass . it has a dark roast coffee aroma with a note of chocolate . it is thick and creamy , pretty full bodied and smooth with a clean finish . the flavor has notes of vanilla creme , strawberry and chocolate . it 's fruity , slightly sweet , milky and roasty . it 's full flavored with a pretty clean finish . the flavor of roasted coffee lingers . ( rated nov 28 , 2008 )

0.80 0.80 1.00 0.90 0.80	had this one today & yesterday ; unfortunately only 2 in the box . appearance is a very pleasant straw color , poured with a nice pillowy head which diminished to nice spotty lacing . aroma is a bit toasty with very faint hops in the background . taste was outstanding and on style . mouthfeel was round and soft , amongst the best mouthfeels i have had in an american beer . the drinkability was quite good . this style is kind of special to me . this style was the first import brew i can remember having . my dad used to buy dab ( dortmund actien brewery ) all the time when i was younger . dab became a staple in my house and is probably why i went into the beer direction , straying from vino and my italian-american heritage -- thanks be to dab . i still always pick up a sixer of dab when i see my dad , who will soon be 85 years young . too bad this style is not very well represented by american brewers . i think this one is better than the great lakes version , dortmund gold . cudos to jim koch for bringing this rare style to us , and such a good version ! ! prosit ! !

0.60 0.60 0.60 0.20 0.20	a - deep murky natural cider/dark caramel color , only ring for head . trace lacing . s - cooked ripe fruit , some off notes . t - egad ! sour , vinegar , nasty bitter , wo n't go away , finish . m - medium body , fair carb , etc . d - this hit the wall , unfortunately . no date on this one , only a number on the label : 5175 . hoping since others have reviewed in last months it would still be good . not .

0.80 0.90 0.60 0.80 0.80	a - poured out a clear , copper/burgundy color with a one-finger , long-lasting , khaki colored head of foam . it had some big bubbles and left some nice lace . s - it smelled very malty and sweet . it had good caramel aroma and some floral notes . t - this had a nice malty flavor with a good sweet caramel taste . there were fruity notes and mild boozy , alcohol flavors . m - it was crisp and smooth with a somewhat sticky mouthfeel . a medium to full bodied beer with a warm alcohol presence . d - this is a really good barleywine . i was really pretty easy drinking despite the high abv . it was n't overly sweet .

0.90 0.80 0.60 0.80 0.80	this is nice looking beer . nice , clean , clear golder yellow . pours a fluffy white head . this dwindles to sparkling sprite of a head . leaves the glass clean as i drain it . smells malty and a little of lemon . sharp taste . some hops . a little too thick on the tongue , but nice . enjoyable beer , rich pils .

0.70 0.70 0.50 0.70 0.90	12 oz . dark brown pour , some light barely gets through . not much head to speak of , a whispy tan ring . sweeter malty aroma , molasses and caramel . chocolate accents . taste is not nearly so sweet . quite a bit of smoke and peat . bakers chocolate maybe cocoa . finishes quite dry with the char and barely a hint of coffee . body is lighter with a nice level of carbonation . maybe a bit thin , er , quite a bit thin , but drinks quite well , as long as the flavors suit you . almost more of a dark scottish ale of some sort . not bad , just a bit different for the style .

0.70 0.70 0.80 0.50 0.60	poured out of a 473ml can into a guinness pint glass . appearance : light golden yellow in colour with a thin , bubbly white head . lots of carbonation in the body . very fine lacing appears with each sip and quickly subsides thereafter . the head retains for about half the time it takes to drink the beer . smell : fairly interesting . some corn , wheat , cereal grains , metallic notes , and yeast . taste : grainy malt and a subdued hop bitterness . the hops are almost undetectable . an average and undistinguished flavour , to say the least . mouthfeel : creamy , smooth body and a slick , wet finish . definitely the strongest aspect of this beer . overall : a decent enough pilsner , mostly indistinct . i 'm not sure why so many ontario craft brewers 'hold back ' on taste and boldness . a drinkable brew and not much more .
